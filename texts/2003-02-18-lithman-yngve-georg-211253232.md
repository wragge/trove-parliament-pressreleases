 Abstract:  This  paper  begins  by  making  a  distinction  between  terrorism  in  the  

 diaspora  and  terrorism  of  the  diaspora.  An  argument  is  developed  to  the  effect  that  

 what  we  witness  of  terrorism  of  the  ‘al-Qaeda’  type  (as  a  generic  albeit  broad  and  

 imprecise  label)  is  to  be  understood  as  a  specifically  diasporic  phenomenon,  a  

 phenomenon  of  the  diaspora.  The  argument  behind  this  assertion  is  multi-dimensional. The diaspora production is analysed against the political and economic 

 developments  in  some  Middle  East  countries,  and  in  particular  the  arrest  of  

 nationalistic,  capitalistic  and  class-based  interest  manifestations.  The  argument  here  

 focuses on how these processes have been conceptually linked to the role played by 

 ‘the West’, and the US in particular. The diaspora, partly produced by these processes 

 of arrestation, in the specifics of its preconditions, make possible the shaping features 

 of  a  ‘symbolic  universe,’  an  integrated  worldview,  where  terrorism  becomes  

 expressive  of  a  globalised  understanding  of  the  world.  Thus  understood,  the  ‘al-  

 Qaeda’ type of terrorism is not a response to modernisation and globalisation, but is 

 indeed as expressive of it as the fight against it.

 Introduction 

 History is best written with hindsight. In the turmoil of on-going affairs, we almost always tend to miss 

 what  future  historians  will  find  important.i  However,  that  what  happened  September  11,  2001,  will  

 have iconic status, as a massive energizer of concerns in many fields seems pretty clear. Already, many 

 insightful  analyses  have  been  made,  sometimes  as  virtual  appendices  to  works  on  relevant  themes  

 already in progress. (That September 11  also  prompted  a torrent of ‘quickies’ of doubtful qualities is 

 another matter.) It seems, however, that one crucial dimension, in fact a sine qua non, has gone mainly 

 over-looked - that September 11 has to be understood as a diasporic phenomenon. It is an example of 

 terrorism of the diaspora as distinct from in the diaspora. 

 

 The background of September 11, as will be discussed here, is that history has served up some pretty 

 complex contemporary situations, that migratory and diasporic phenomena are parts of this complexity, 

 and that under certain circumstances, acts of terrorism has to be seen as linked to diasporic conditions. 

 Such terrorism can have  two  different links to  diasporic conditions; they can be  in the diaspora or of  

 the  diaspora.  To  terrorism  in  the  diaspora  would  count  e.g.  the  IRA  activities  in  England,  and  the  

 Croat-related  killing  of  the  Yugoslav  ambassador  in  Sweden.  In  cases  such  as  these,  we  are  dealing  

 with  activities  of  a  kind  that  have  their  ideological  and  social  action  grounding  in  well-established  

 political  and  economic  features,  e.g.  and  perhaps  most  prominently,  nationalistic  movements.  The  

 terrorist  acts  take  place  in  the  diaspora,  but  this  is  virtually  incidental  -  the  acts  are  aimed  at  an  

 occupant/aggressor in the homelands. The diasporic quality is not a definatory constituent quality of the 

 terrorist  activity.  Terrorism of  the  diaspora,  on  the  other  hand,  would  mean  acts  of  terrorism that  are  

 analytically constituted in, emergent in, and expressed in, the diasporic condition. In, fact, the argument 

 here suggests that terrorism of the diaspora has certain paradigmatic qualities   

 

 Terrorism is a loaded word, and rightly so. However, without detracting from the horrors it produces, 

 we  must  also  attempt  to  understand  its  logic.  One  person’s  terrorist  may  well  be  another  person’s  

 freedom fighter or  holy warrior. If we  don’t try to  understand  how this can be, we  will certainly also  

 make ourselves unnecessarily vulnerable.  

 

 The  argument  to  be  presented  here  is  that  the  diasporic  situation  provides  certain  possibilities  for  

 thinking and action, which are unlikely to emerge in non-diasporic situations. If one so wishes, this can 

 be  regarded  as  a  structural-functional  argument  (and  in  spite  of  the  criticism against  such  arguments:  

 who can do without structural and functional arguments in a social science analysis?). With this basis, 

 it  is  also  obvious  that  the  argument  here  is  an  anthropological-sociological  one;  contrary to  what  the  

 individualism  ideology  in  which  we  live  our  everyday  lives  tells  us.  Steering  away  from  making  

 personal decisions by people like bin Laden supremely important, or even turning specific biographies 

 into  explanations, the focus is on social and  cultural processes. In terms of the thematic, terrorism of 

 the diaspora, the genesis of specific diasporic situations carries with it also opportunities and closures 

 as to  the possibilities that are contained  within the diasporic situation,  i.e., related  to  how to  interpret 

 the  world  and  how  to  action-wise  relate  to  it.  And,  as  will  be  demonstrated  later,  the  sociology  of  

 4   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 religion has provided us with some exceptionally clear insights as to how religious beliefs and activities 

 are likely to shape up under different conditions. 

 Jihad  is a term which has many elaborations, from exertions in the direction of living a pious life to, 

 more commonly, holy war. In a highly interesting book, which also has influenced many later writers, 

 Barber  (1995),  Jihad  is  formed  into  s  symbol  for  ‘tribalism,’  which  is  perhaps  not  the  best  term  for  

 what Barber is after, the localized, the non-globalized. However, Barber is after the dialectic between 

 on the one hand mass society and market globalization, McWorld, and on the other a fragmentation of 

 nation-states  and  other  political  entities  into  e.g.  ethnically  or  religiously  argued  political  

 particularisms,  i.e.  Jihad.  In  this  sense,  Barber’s  ambitions  are  superficially  somewhat  similar  to  the  

 ambitions in this article. However, Barber stresses the independence and dynamics between McWorld 

 and  Jihad,  and  makes  ontological  distinctions  between  them.  They are,  so  to  say,  engaged  in  a  battle  

 where one of them potentially can be a winner. An analysis of September 11 with a proper weight to 

 the  formation  of  and  the  dynamics  of  the  diasporic  dimensions  will  suggest  a  somewhat  different  

 interpretation, that this particular form of Jihad should be seen in all its relevant aspects as not just in a 

 dialectical relationship with globalization.  Instead, it can be seen as a prime example of the forces of 

 globalization. This said, the present author is immediately anxious to stress that this article is not in the 

 least meant as a blanket condemnation of globalization. Globalization is a many-facetted phenomenon, 

 and the analysis presented here deals with just one little aspect.  

 

 The emergence of the new Muslim diaspora in Europe 

 In 1777 the envoy of the Sublime Porte, Resmi Ahmed Effendi, wrote a report to Sultan Abdul Hamid I 

 where  he  enthusiastically  recounted  his  reception  in  Berlin,  and  stated,  “the  population  of  Berlin  

 recognizes the prophet Mohammed and would not be afraid to accept Islam” (ThomÃ¤-Venske 1988:78). 

 History,  as  we  all  know,  turned  out  to  be  a  bit  more  complicated  than  that.  While  we  have  had  a  

 significant Islamic presence in parts of Europe, it was not until almost 200 years later that there was a 

 notable number of Muslims in northern Europe. This came mainly about through what can roughly be 

 described as the streams of labor migration in the post-war, pre-oil crisis times. It would be mistaken to 

 believe, however, that we  are just dealing with laborers; on the contrary, significant numbers were in 

 fact  also  students,  marriage  partners,  etc.,  and  their  motivations  for  moving  to  northern  Europe  also  

 included  a  variety  of  dissatisfactions  with  the  conditions  in  their  home  countries.  This  was,  after  all,  

 virulent times associated with de-colonization and nation-building in many of the countries from which 

 Muslims  came.  The  result  of  all  this  is  fairly  well  known  in  its  broad  outlines.  In  many  northern  

 European  countries,  this  period  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  notable  minorities  with  Muslim  

 background.  In  all  likelihood,  there  was  more  social  mobility  and  assimilation  than  we  usually  

 recognize, but there was also the formation of neighbourhoods of people with such backgrounds having 

 difficulties to achieve any reasonably dignified existence in the new countries. It should be pointed out, 

 that  Muslim or  Islamic  here  does  not  denote  socially effective  entities.  On  the  contrary,  there  were  a  

 variety of divisions and distinctions, running a.o. along sectarian, home country, and linguistic lines, as 

 well as along a general secular-religious continuum.ii 

 

 5   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 The  period  after  the  mid-1970s  saw  a  different  kind  of  immigration,  mainly  by  refugees  and  people  

 who  came  through  family  (re)unification  openings.  Hereby  the  diversity  of  the  Muslim  populations 

 increased further, as this refugee-generation encompassed situations in a variety of countries, including 

 the  Iran-Iraqi  conflict,  the  collapse  of  former  Yugoslavia,  the  wars  in  Ethiopia,  Sudan,  Nigeria,  and  

 also  smaller  numbers  from  Asian  conflicts.  There  are  significant  indications,  that  these  refugees,  

 especially  those  from  Arab  and  African  countries,  have  had  perhaps  bigger  problems  than  any  other  

 immigrants to find a good or even acceptable living in the receiving countries. 

 

 The developments in the Islamic heartlands 

 Many  commentators  to  September  11  have  pointed  to  the  role  of  the  Western  states  in  shaping  the  

 present Arab world, and rightly so. The Cold War and superpower involvement in the Arab world, of 

 course  energized  by  the  oil  fields,  included  a  role  in  largely  destroying  a  budding  state-bounded  or  

 Arab  nationalism.iii   Much  has  also  been  made  of  the  presumed  Saudi  inability to  protect  the  Islamic  

 heartlands against ‘the infidels,’ particularly against the Americans in relations to the Iraqi war. More 

 generally,  the  coalition  between  the  US  and  Saudi-Arabia  has  been  seen  as  a  vehicle,  it  has  been  

 claimed,  by  the  dissatisfied,  to  have  a  proper  development  in  the  Muslim/Islamic  world.  The  Israeli-Palestine  conflict  has  also,  of  course,  received  attention  as  a  festering  conflict  involving  super-power(s).  A  number  of  other  issues  have  quite  rightly  been  noted  in  order  to  account  for  the  

 ‘background’ to the presumed frustrations on the part on those advocating an Islamic fundamentalism.iv  

 

 However  significant  particular  issues  like  these  may be,  it  is  possible  to  depict  certain  processes  and  

 their inter-relationship, and to see these as having analytical advantages in ‘explaining’ what led up to 

 September  11.  There  are  three  processes  in  particular  that  are  to  be  dealt  with  here,  the  arrest  of  an  

 incipient nationalist, the arrest of an incipient capitalism, and the dynamics of diaspora formation. The 

 import of these processes have to do with three things, the way in which they open for interpretations 

 of how the world is configured (and this will lead to a sociology of knowledge application), the ways 

 they  served  to  create  part-diasporas  with  specific  features,  and  the  way  they  led  to  certain  

 characteristics  of  the  present  Arab/Muslim  heartlands.  The  last  of  these  issues,  the  diaspora’s  

 relationships  to  the  heartlands,  is  not  least  important  to  understand.  And,  as  hinted  at  above,  it  is  the  

 combined, mutual energizing that took place as a result of these processes that should be primarily kept 

 in mind.

 The arrest of an incipient nationalism 

 After  the  Second  World  War,  there  were  a  number  of  reasons  to  believe  that  the  Middle  East  would  

 develop  along  nationalistic  principles  of  structuring.  Countries  such  as  Iran  certainly  took  significant  

 steps  in  that  direction,  and  even  the  ousting  of  Mossadeq  did  not  put  a  complete  end  to  this  

 development. A modernization project under the management of the Shah did not, however, more than 

 to  a  very  limited  degree  involve  democratization  and  the  building  towards  nationalism.  Defining  the  

 political  unit  as  the  people  within  a  geopolitical  unit  was  not  to  be  reconciled  with  an  increasingly  

 despotic  regime  in  collaboration  with  major  oil  interests  and  seeing  as  one  of  its  task  to  counter  any 

 Soviet  expansion  towards  the  Gulf.  The  absence  of  virtually  any  democratic  institutions  left  few  

 vehicles for organization and resistance, and it would be political theology that would carry Khomeni 

 to  his  peak  achievement,  backed  by  a  frustrated  middle  class.  In  the  early  1970s,  there  were  also  

 various Marxist groups who, inspired even by persons like Che Guevara and Mao and also supported 

 by Iranians in the European diaspora, attempted to achieve a change of regime. The end of all this is 

 well known - Khomeni’s return in triumph after a fifteen-year exile. 

 

 Looking at several other countries in the region, such as Iran, we find up to and including the 1960s a 

 strong  tendency  towards  something  of  a  separation  of  Islam  and  public  life.  Socialism,  anti-Zionism  

 and trends towards a pan-Arabic nationalism are some features. It should not be forgotten that Saddam 

 Hussein in his career was a Baathist, a supporter of a pan-Arabic nationalism.  

 

 The list could be made longer, and would contain roughly the same ingredients.v Does that mean that 

 the thwarted nationalistic attempts all should be explained on a case-by-case basis? Not really. One can 

 see  how certain  dimensions  of  social,  political,  economic,  and  religious  life  are  constantly present  as  

 obstacles to nationalistic developments both in specific countries and also on a more regional basis. For 

 one  thing,  there  is,  or  in  this  context,  was,  the  distinction  between  the  monarchies,  Saudi  Arabia  and  

 Jordan,  and  the  often-called  progressives,  primarily  Egypt,  Syria,  and  Iraq.  Furthermore,  and  more  

 generally,  these  countries  were  virtually  all  constructions  during  the  20th  century.  As  such,  they  

 reflected  little  development  based  on  internal  homogeneity.  Instead,  they  were  all  characterized  by  

 significant  divisions  that  made  any  all-embracing  nationalism  all  but  impossible.  Iraq  is  of  course  a  

 splendid  example.  It  was  thrown  together  by  the  British,  with  the  remarkable  Gertrude  Bell  as  

 kingmaker,  after  the  First  World  War.  Its  name  means  ‘the  well-rooted  country’  -  while  in  fact  the  

 British expected all the divisions within it, religious, ethnic, class-wise, would make it easy to control. 

 The British also installed Faisal 1 as king - a man who was the son of the Sharif of Mecca, who had 

 never  visited  what  was  to  become  Iraq,  and  who  was  voted  ruler  by  an  English-staged  congregation  

 where no-one had met the King to be - which did not prevent the candidate from receiving a virtually 

 unanimous support. In Anderson’s (1988) terms, the history, geography, religious and ethnic division 

 of Iraq makes it virtually impossible to  imagine what kind  of discourse that could have promoted the 

 development of a sustainable nationalistic ideology. 

 

 The story from Iraq is -with variations- the story from several of the countries in the area. Once formal 

 7   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 de-colonization  had  run  its  course,  once  the  resistance  against  occupying  forces  was  void,  the  

 nationalistic  ideologies  also  got  into  progressively  worse  problems.  However,  one  effect  of  the  

 nationalistic movements was the creation of a diaspora, not least comprised of refugees, for whom their 

 home countries represented un-fulfilled political developments.  

 

 Saudi Arabia of course stands out as something of a singularity. Maybe Bernhard Lewis (2002) has the 

 most striking formulation:  

 

 “Imagine … if the Ku Klux Klan or Aryan Nation had obtained total control of Texas and had at 

 its  disposal  all  the  oil  revenues,  and  used  this  money  to  establish  a  network  of  well-endowed  

 schools and colleges all over Christendom peddling their particular brand of Christianity. This is 

 what  the  Saudis  have  done  with  Wahhabism.  The  oil  money  has  enabled  them  to  spread  this  

 fanatical, destructive form of Islam all over the Muslim world and among Muslims in the west. 

 Without oil and  the creation of the Saudi kingdom, wahhabism would  have  remained  a lunatic 

 fringe in a marginal country.” 

 

 Egypt  and  nationalism is  of  course  tied  to  the  name  of  Nasser,  who  led  the  failed  war  against  Israel.  

 Nasser, the self-described progressive got threatened by leftist students, and his successor, Sadat, saw 

 the Islamization of the campuses as a way of defusing the leftist threat - and at the same time gave up 

 the state prerogative regarding ideological expressions in the public space. 

 

 The arrest of an incipient capitalism 

 If  the  nationalistic  option,  if  this  is  what  we  can  call  one  type  of  development,  as  a  part  of  

 modernization  was  closed,  another  significant  development  associated  with  what  we  usually  call  

 modernity was also  closed. For the sake  of brevity, this can be  called  the development of a capitalist 

 society,  a  society  where  the  conflict  between  different  segments  of  society  is  a  major  structuring  

 vehicle. In a more reduced version, we find capital pitted against workers, and with the state providing 

 the  mediation  and  ensuring  the  functioning  of  the  economy.  (This  is  not  intended  as  a  particularly  

 Marxist version of sociology, but rather a kind of description pretty close to data.)  The main point in 

 this argument is that the emergence of a class-based society, in the sense of worker collectivities, etc., 

 never emerged as major instruments in social change.  This, however, took place against a background 

 where  socialist  and  Marxist  ideas  had  been  very prominent  parts  of  the  de-colonization  struggle,  and  

 also  afterwards.  There  was  also  any  number  of  manifestations  of  attempts  by  workers  to  appear  as  a  

 collectivity  in  these  countries,  such  as  the  first  student  rebellion  in  Egypt  against  Nasser  in  1968,  

 backed  by  workers  from  the  industrial  city  of  Helouan.  However,  especially  in  the  big  oil  countries,  

 Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the major economic activities came to be defined within state power, 

 and what Kepel (2002) so fittingly calls Petro-Islam was a development within this context. There were 

 certainly  capitalists,  and  Bin  Ladin’s  father  was  one  of  those  who  made  it  big,  in  his  case  in  

 construction. However, there never emerged a class of capitalists, for example through the expansion of 

 the bazaar economies, which was able to function outside the state apparatus to the extent that it could 

 8   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 assert itself as a class with a significant measure of autonomy vis-Ã -vis the state. Similarly, there never 

 emerged  a  sustained  working  class  in  the  sense  of  class  belonging  being  a  significant  reference  for  

 consciousness formation or social action.  

 

 The situation in Iran towards the end of the previous century, as described by Kepel (2002: 106), was 

 of  course  in  some  sense  unique,  “…massive  unemployment  moral  repression,  and  a  cataleptic  social  

 order that was completely dominate by the religious hierarchy, the ‘pious foundations’ that controlled 

 the economy in collusion with the bazaar merchants, and a whole crew of profiteers who prayed on the 

 Islamic Republic.” At the same time, it illustrates very well the arrest of a capitalist development. In so 

 doing,  it  also  points  to  the  collusion  between  state  power  and  its  encompassment  of  economic  

 opportunities.   

 

 To  this  should  be  added,  that  the  western  states,  in  particular  the  US,  is  continuously  interpreted  as  

 being  one  or  the  major  source  of  the  troubles.  The  US  had  in  large  measure  supported  the  Islamist  

 trend,  not  just  in  its  collaboration  with  the  Taliban  but  also  in  a  variety  of  other  ways,  including  the  

 initial  support  of  the  Islamists  in  Algeria.  At  the  same  time,  the  Islamists  from  Saudi  Arabia  and  

 everywhere else saw the West, in particular the US, supporting Israel and the US (as the symbol of the 

 western  world)  was  made  out   (partly  as  a  legacy  of  left-wing  intellectual  legacies  in  Arab  countries  

 going  back  decades)  to  be  responsible  for  the  economic  and  political  squeeze  resulting  in  dire  

 circumstances  facing  the  Islamic  heartlands  and  Islamic  countries  everywhere.  Its  collusion  with  the  

 government  of  Saudi  Arabia  secured  this  regime.  By  Islamists,  Saudi  Arabia’s  granting  the  US  to  

 station  troops  in  the  ‘holy  lands’  was  made  out  to  be  a  gross  breach  of  Quranic  injunctions  against  

 infidels. Given the ideology of the religious hardliners, Saudi Arabia betrayed its trust - it was, to put it 

 that  way,  not  wahhabitic  enough.  From  another  perspective,  the  US  collaboration  with  the  Saudi  

 government gave no additional room for expanding the public space. 

 

 The diasporic conditions 

 These  developments  in  the  states  in  the  Islamic  heartlands  (and  countries  such  as  Pakistan  and  

 Indonesia have not been dealt with above, but could easily be included in the analysis) led to diasporic 

 developments with some specific qualities.  

 

 For  one  thing,  we  had  a  large  number  of  people  who  migrated  from largely Muslim countries  due  to  

 any variety of political, economic or other reasons. Here we find those populating the poor suburbs in 

 our major western European cities. While these millions were not involved in anything relating to the 

 September  11  terrorism,  by  Islamists  (and  I  use  this  term  loosely)  their  conditions  were  seen  as  

 emblematic of the disdain with which the West treated Muslims. They also had another important role 

 in the new geography of the world created by the Islamists, they provided an alibi for claiming that at 

 least parts of Europe were, or were in the process of becoming, dar-el-Islam, Islamic heartlands. The 

 implication  of  this  was,  that  Islamic  observances  should  be  much  more  forcefully  upheld.  When  the  

 Muslim worker interviewed by Schiffauer (1988) in the 1980s states as a fact that ‘this is Germany,’ he 

 9   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 also meant that this was a place where you could not be a Muslim; an attitude coupled with a resigned 

 utilitarianism.  

 These millions of migrants, however, were neither without interest to their sending countries, nor to the 

 dissidents  in  these  countries.  Petro-Islam,  via  countries  such  as  Saudi-Arabia,  Iran,  Libya,  and  also,  

 almost as a counter-measure, Turkey, got heavily involved in trying to assume some ideological control 

 over  these  diasporic  populations.  The  reasons  were  manifold.  The  migrants  represented  significant  

 economic  resources,  e.g.  through  remittances,  but  perhaps  even  more  important  was  their  possible  

 influence,  ideologically,  politically,  over  the  future  shape  of  Islamic  expansion  -  and  also  what  

 repercussions  this  would  have  in  the  Islamic  heartlands.  To  some  extent,  youth  from  these  diasporic  

 conditions were also recruited for various Islamistic courses. 

 

 This  diaspora  also  provided  the  basis  and  legitimacy  for  a  number  of  activists  and  organizers  who  

 grafted themselves onto it. We can see this as a second diasporic development, and with very different 

 roots  from  the  general  migration  from  countries  with  a  heavy  Muslim  population.  It  is  now that  e.g.  

 ‘Londonistan’ became a phrase to denote the coexistence of a variety of groups related to the battles, 

 military  or  otherwise,  going  on  in  Afghanistan,  Algeria,  Saudi  Arabia,  etc.  The  emergence  of  this  

 variety of groups, headed by assorted intellectuals, imams, jihadists, etc., had significant consequences, 

 also  for  how  several  western  states  related  to  Islamic  concerns.  It  also  led  to  much  more  articulated  

 demands  on  these  states  about  how  to  relate  to  Islam  and  the  diasporic  populations  -  including  

 exhortations that Chirac should embrace the Muslim faith. 

 

 In  very  general  terms,  one  may  say  that  England  became  much  more  important  than  France  for  this  

 second  diasporic  development.  Initially,  there  appears  to  have  been  a  great  degree  of  caution  on  the  

 part of this second diaspora to create issues in France, and the designation of France as a dar-el-Islam, 

 an Islamic land, served to restrain from e.g. violence (but also led to e.g. an emphasis on veils). This 

 situation changed during the latter part of the 1990s, with violence erupting in France. To this second 

 diasporic  development  belongs  also  the  ‘blind  sheik,  ´  Omar  Abdel  Rahman,  known  for  his  

 involvement in the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993.  

 

 The third diasporic development to note here is the movements associated with Afghanistan. The war 

 against the Soviet Union was turned into a jihad, and attracted a number of ‘Arab’ fighters, as well as 

 Muslims  from  other  countries,  to  help  in  the  battle.  After  the  cease  of  that  war,  these  fighters  

 constituted a “.milieu … cut off from social reality; its inhabitants perceived the world in the light of 

 religious  doctrine  and  armed  violence  …”,  and  “they  constituted  a  pool  of  manpower  that  could  be  

 used by the secret services of a number of states who might find it opportune to manipulate unattached 

 extremist  militants”   (Kepel  2002:219).  Their  ideology,  jihadist-salafism,  advocated  a  return  to  the  

 ways  of  the  devout  ancestors  and  was  hostile  to  any  and  all  religious  innovation.  The  ideologues  

 included Abu Qatada, a Palestinian, Abu Musab -a Syrian naturalized in Spain, the Egyptian Mustapha 

 Kamel, naturalized in Britain.

 The logic of religious action 

 The analysis of September 11 has so far contained virtually no real treatment of what led up to it from 

 the perspective of the sociology of religion. This is all the more notable since there is a great literature 

 about  what  forms  of  religiosity  that  is  likely  to  emerge  under  which  social,  cultural  and  economic  

 circumstances. While such an analysis will contribute significantly to grasp the issues at hand, it will of 

 course just be one part of the puzzle with which this article is concerned.  

 

 The  classical  tenet  of  the  sociology  of  religions  is  that  there  is  a  correspondence  between  social  

 situation and form of religiosity. In Weber’s (1965) classical schema, he makes a distinction on the one 

 hand between asceticism and mysticism on the one hand, and inner- and other-worldly orientations on 

 the  other.  Islam,  he  sees  representing  a  kind  of  inner-worldly  asceticism,  but  he  (if  anyone!)  is  also  

 fully aware of the shaping societal forces. Rex (1988) points out that what seems to characterize Islam 

 in the early period of immigration and minority status in the western European states are pragmatic and 

 quietistic adjustments.vi As Rex points out, in Niebuhr’s (1975) typology, the Muslims in the diaspora 

 fell  somewhere  between  ‘the  churches  of  the  middle  classes’  (a  doctrine  of  individual  piety  is  

 substituted  for  any  social  doctrine)  and  ‘the  churches  of  the  disinherited’  (the  churches  demanding  a  

 reversal of the social order). In actual practice, the reversal of the social order was pretty well confined 

 to  those  aspects  of  existence  that  relate  to  Islamic  family life  and  sexuality,  and  the  implications  this  

 had for changes in the educational system, a.a. 

 

 The  Muslim  populations  in  Western  Europe,  with  the  exceptions  of  the  tiniest  of  minorities,  had  of  

 course no relationship to the executioners of September 11. Their situation, however, became a part of 

 an ideologizing which provided a general interpretation of the world where terrorism (against the west, 

 the  US)  became  a  result.  This  ideologizing  has  the  characteristics  of  what  Berger  and  Luckmann  

 (1967:103)  called  a  ‘symbolic  universe,’  ‘a  comprehensive  integration  of  all  discrete  institutional  

 processes. The entire society now makes sense.’ In the case of Al Queda and similar groupings, what 

 makes  up  this  symbolic  universe?  The  answer  has  to  deal  both  with  closures  of  other  ways  of  

 conceptualizing  the  world,  and  also  show  how  this  ‘symbolic  universe’  was  constructed  and  what  

 energized people to act on this image of, as it were, the world.  

 

 The main ingredient in this ideologizing can be said to be a globalized version of an integrismo Islam, 

 an  Islam  where  all  parts  of  society  is  organized  according  to  Islamic  prescriptions.  It  was  a  

 globalization  that  was  much  more  pregnant  and  went  far  beyond  some  general  admonition  by  a  

 religious founding father to have his disciples preach his gospel. Instead, it was created out of what was 

 perceived as and underpinned by real and often painful experiences of global forces. The ideologizing 

 was totalizing - the whole world made sense, if interpreted within its schema. It should also be pointed 

 out, that this totalizing was not new in Islamic circles. The best known example is perhaps the ideology 

 behind Jamaat-I-Islami, the creation of Mawlana Mawdudi, a trans-national who was born in India and 

 in  the  1920’s  started  to  produce  what  was  to  become  Pakistan’s  perhaps  main  contribution  to  such  

 ideologizing.  Sayyid  Qutb,  an  Egyptian,  and  Khomeni  are  others  who  should  be  mentioned  in  this  

 11   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 context.     

 

 The  first  step  in  explaining  the  totalizing  ideology  has  to  go  back  to  the  situation  in  the  Muslim  

 countries (literary expediency forces me to use such a poor expression). The first thing to note is the 

 terrible  state  of  many  of  these  countries.  At  the  same  time,  the  mechanisms  for  change  are  in  many  

 ways blocked - reference was made earlier to the arrest of the nationalist and the capitalist options. The 

 attempts  at  socialist  developments  have  also  collapsed.  The  causes  of  the  bad  shape  in  which  these  

 countries find themselves, in this ideologizing, was a combination of corrupt and/or infidel leadership 

 in  these  countries  together  with  their  collaboration  with  the  Western  states,  particularly  the  US.  The  

 condition  facing  the  Muslim  immigrants  in  Western  Europe  was  just  proof  of  the  denigration  of  

 Muslims.  

 

 Two  singularities  impacted  upon  this  situation,  the  war  in  Afghanistan  and  the  Israeli-Palestinian  

 conflict.  The  war  brought  together  also  a  transnational  band  of  fighters  for  the  Islamic  cause,  and  

 showed  (rightly  or  wrongly)  that  Islamic  forces  could  successfully  defeat  a  superpower.  The  Israeli-Palestinian conflict was, in this interpretation of the world, expressive of that justice and equity was not 

 to  be  had  from the  hands of infidels  -  and  that  the  Palestinian suffering could  only be  ended  through 

 violence against the oppressors.  

 

 Who were those who created this ideology? And who acted upon it, even to the degree of the suicide 

 flyings? To say that this ideology was created by people like Bin Laden is not very correct - Mawdudi 

 and others had spelled out its essentials long before the turn of the century. However, it was picked up 

 and energized by persons who were in many ways really characterized by their trans-national qualities. 

 Not only did they come from different states, but they were also in large measure dispossessed by these 

 states. They represented the excluded, and their identification was with a variety of Muslim situations: 

 the  conditions  in  the  Middle  East,  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  the  Muslim  minorities  in  Europe,  the  

 Palestinians. We are, with a very peculiar example, back to Niebuhr’s religion of the dispossessed. The 

 logic goes: the dispossessed demands a reversal of the social order, and since this social order is seen as 

 manifest in a global web of deceit and dependencies, as far as the loci of powers are concerned in this 

 ideologizing,  the global order of things have  to  be  changed.  And  the transnationals, unrestricted  by a 

 homeland  geography  and  secular  solidarities  within  the  homelands,  were  the  one’s  who  could  see  

 themselves  as  the  vanguard  of  transformation.  The  fact  that  some  of  these,  with  bin  Ladin  as  the  

 paradigmatic  example,  of  course,  were  born  into  wealth  and  status  does  not  detract  from  the  

 characterization  of  dispossession.  What  he,  and  his  ideological  compatriots  reacted  against,  was  not  

 their private situations, but the denigration of the social world which they felt they were a part of - and 

 this social world came to be interpreted as the Muslim community. 

 

 The  fractionalization  of  nationalist,  socialist  and  capitalist  endeavors  as  well  as  fractionalized  class  

 belongings,  is  one  thing  to  remember  when  trying  to  understand  why  ‘no  other’  ways  of  formulating  

 protests were available. To avoid misunderstandings, it should be pointed out that other ‘solutions’ of 

 12   LITHMAN, Yngve 

 course  existed.  Niebuhr  would  presumably  point  to  otherworldly  asceticism  as  one  possible  avenue,  

 and doubtless many have gone this way. In the rough and tumble of human existence, however, we can 

 be  fairly  certain  that  all  possible  avenues  of  ideologizing  and  acting  will  be  tried  out,  by  few  or  by  

 many.  

 

 Conclusions 

 Looking  at  this  from  the  perspective  of  what  it  entails  for  the  understanding  of  migration  and  the  

 Muslim existence in Europe, what conclusions can be drawn? If we live in a world where globalization 

 is  a  factor,  of  course  we  will  also  see  violence  that  has  to  be  partly  explained  with  reference  to  

 globalization.  

 

 Further,  what  is  often  described  as  varieties  of  ‘fundamentalism’  must  sometimes,  perhaps  often,  or  

 always,  be  interpreted  not  as  reactions  against  modernity.  Instead,  one  may  well  argue,  as  has  been  

 done  in  this  article,  that  fundamentalism  (which  is  how  many  have  described  e.g.  the  Al  Queda  

 ideology and  activities) may be  firmly generated  out of modernity and  globalization.  This, of course, 

 also  means  that  the  distinction  is  not  between  McWorld  and  Jihad,  but  that  there  are  varieties  of  

 McWorld  (and  one  of  them  happens  to  be  McJihad).  It  also  follows,  that  what  is  sometimes  

 characterized as religious fundamentalism cannot be understood as religious fundamentalism. Religion 

 always  encodes  social,  political  and  economic  circumstances,  and  expresses  them  in  culturalized  

 understandings. Therefore, the focus on religion itself as a prime explanation will never do.  

 

 The future, if we are to follow the insights from the sociology of religion, as to the Muslims in Europe, 

 will be related to two factors. On the one hand, a dispossession will result also in a greater demand for 

 a reversal of the social order. On the other, the creation of loyalties following non-religious dimensions 

 will serve to reduce the strengthening of ‘the religion of the dispossessed.’ The conclusion to be drawn 

 from all this is almost banal: decent societies create decent people.

 Notes  i  This article has benefited from several discussions with Bruce Kapferer. The day before September  11, 2001, we had been discussing what we thought was a surprising lack of terrorist activities in the  US, including such things as suicide bombings with hijacked airplanes. Once the World Trade Center  attack had happened, he was immediately ready with an analysis that included class fragmentation and  the symbolic importance of the Muslim migrants in the West.   ii

  There is a fairly large but uneven literature about these issues. Kepel deals excellently with some of  the Islamic issues in a number of works. Gerholm and Lithman (1988), although depicting a somewhat  earlier period, also deals with the situation in several countries.   iii

  The Mossadeq overthrow is a paradigmatic example; the CIA planning, available on the Internet,  makes Greene’s quiet American seem a very straightforward guy.  iv  The term fundamentalism, originally used to connote certain protestant/evangelical sects, is for  several reasons not a very good term. It stresses the Quranic texts, rather than the ‘integrated’ social,  political, and economic life within Islamic life that those called ‘fundamentalists’ strive for. However,  since the designation fundamentalists appears to become the standard term, I will -for the sake of  brevity and simplicity- use it here.    v

  While my argument is somewhat different, Kepel (2002) is an excellent source for many of the issues  covered here.  vi  Rex deals with England, the extension to the rest of Western Europe is by the present author.  Justification for this can be drawn from the other articles in the volume.
