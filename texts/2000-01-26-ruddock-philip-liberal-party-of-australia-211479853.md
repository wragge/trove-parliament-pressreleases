  MINISTER’S ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING CAMPAIGN

  BRINGS INCREASED COOPERATION

  

  In ternational cooperation will play a major role in stemming 
the illegal flow of people to Australia, the Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

  

 Mr Ruddock was speaking on his return from Jordan, 
Syria, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan where he had extensive discussions 
with government officials and humanitarian organisations about the need 
for an international approach to a global problem.

  

 “The countries I visited have experienced significant 
problems for many years with the illegal movement of huge numbers of 
people and the growing involvement of organised crime in people smuggling,” 
Mr Ruddock said.

  

 1 am heartened by the readiness of those countries 
to work together on solutions to put a stop to this despicable trade. 
However it is obvious that this is a complex problem that will not be 
solved overnight with simple solutions.

  

 “The global community must develop - and quickly 
- the same determination in fighting people trafficking, as it has shown 
in campaigns against the criminal drug trade.

  

 “I have been impressed by the agreement to cooperate 
with Australia in areas such as intelligence exchange, enhanced technical 
cooperation and action in multilateral agencies, particularly the UN 
High Commission for Refugees, and negotiations on a convention on transnational 
crime,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 As well as securing cooperation on action at the international 
level, Mr Ruddock announced a range of specific programs to work with 
source countries to deal with people smugglers, including a refugee 
identification workshop for Turkish judges and prosecutors. The Government 
will also examine ways in which it can further enhance Australian knowledge 
and expertise about refugee issues in source countries.

  

 Technical cooperation will be developed with all five 
countries, including training in detection of fraudulent documentation 
and cooperation at airports, particularly in the lead up to the Olympic 
Games. Mr Ruddock foreshadowed detailed follow-up discussions by senior 
officials on these issues.

  

  Mr Ruddock said he had also spoken extensively to the media during 
his visits. As a result, wide coverage had been given to the tough new 
measures Australia had introduced to counter people smuggling.

  

  “This is a message we will continue to promote a s part of 
our campaign to deter people from putting themselves into the hands 
of criminal people traffickers,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 “As a result of my discussions with officials and 
representatives during my visits, the Government will be examining further 
initiatives to deter people smuggling and to ensure that the integrity 
of our refugee and humanitarian program is not undermined,” Mr Ruddock 
said.

  

 The Minister also welcomed the successful visit of 
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to Indonesia and the advice from Mr 
Downer that Indonesia would welcome an early visit by Mr Ruddock.

  

 Mr Ruddock said that arrangements for the visit were 
being examined.
