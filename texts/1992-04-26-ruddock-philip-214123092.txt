 MIGRATION REDUCTIONS HIJACKED

 The closet announcement by Prime Minister Keating to elements of the Chinese  community that those 20,000 PRC nationals in Australia at the time of the Tienanmen  Square Massacre and their dependents will be able to remain permanently, adds  effectively another 34,000 people to the migration program.

 This is more than the foreshadowed reduction of 31,000 planned by Minister Hand in the  government's program for next year.

 The Prime Minister appears to want to have his cake and eat it too on this issue. He  cannot effectively announce immigration program reductions while miraculously turning  temporary residence into permanent residence for a large number of people who have 

 escaped proper migration criteria.

 The public hostility to Prime Minister Hawke's initial announcement that 20,000 PRC  nationals could stay permanently was so great that the government had to water it down  to 4-year temporary entry. That is all the PRC nationals were entitled to under the law  unless they are able to make a claim, case-by-case, for protection as refugees or for  change of status on spouse or occupational grounds on the same basis as any other  temporary entry permit holder from any other part of the world.

 Prime Minister Keating did not in any way have to re-affirm the vague promises of his  predecessor, which do not have to be implemented until after June 1994.

 It is quite clear that the Prime Minister is seeking to obtain short term political advantage  from elements of the Chinese community and is quite prepared to sacrifice proper,  consistent and sensible decision making to exploiting political opportunity in the ethnic  media.

 Hawke at least made the flawed decision against the background of a shed tear for the  victims of the Tienanmen Square massacre. Keating however, had the benefit of hindsight  as he sacrificed the national interest.
