 Women Raising Our Voices Forum 

 16/05/2010 

 

 Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, today opened the  'Women Raising Our Voices National Forum' at Sydney University.   

 The National Forum is a key part of the Raising the Voice of Migrant Women  Workers in Precarious Employment project, which received $100,000 under  the Government's Women's Leadership and Development Program Grants.  

 The forum brought together nearly 200 women, mainly from Chinese and  Vietnamese backgrounds, to have their say on the issues they face in the  workplace, at home and in the community.   

 The project is being run by the Network of Immigrant and Refugee Women  of Australia (NIRWA) in partnership with Asian Women at Work.    

 Immigrant and refugee women can face barriers to participating in the  workforce and wider community, such as language, culture, and in some  cases, prejudice.   

 The project is supporting migrant women workers' to be effective community  advocates.    

 NIRWA is the lead agency for the Australian Immigrant and Refugee  Women's Alliance (AIRWA) - one of the six National Women's Alliances that  share in   $3.6 million from the Australian Government as announced in March this  year.

 As the voice for immigrant and refugee women, AIRWA provides a vehicle  to deliver to Government the ongoing concerns of women, such as those  being reached through this forum.
