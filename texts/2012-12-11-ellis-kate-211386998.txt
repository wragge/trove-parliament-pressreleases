 ADDRESS AT THE LAUNCH OF OECD ACTIVATION  REVIEW AND ‘EMPLOYMENT SERVICES: BUILDING ON  SUCCESS’ ISSUES PAPER  11 DECEMBER 2012

 [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OMITTED]   

 Like many people here today, I am very appreciative of the  OECD’s rigour and perspective.    

 And as the Employment Participation Minister in a Labor  government, I am pleased to know that Australia’s labour  market policies - and out employment services system - are  working well.    

 I am also proud of the fact the OECD has recognised the  importance of the government’s reforms, including changing the  previous system of expensive and ineffective Work for the Dole  programs, introducing a compliance framework that keeps  people engaged and directing resources to those who need  them most.    

 I think it is worth - just for a moment - reflecting on the very  positive state of both the Australian economy and the  Australian labour market.    

 Over the last five years, strong economic management in the  wake of the GFC has ensured that Australians have kept their  jobs.     

 In fact, over this time, more than 840,000 jobs have been  created.    

 And our unemployment rate is the envy of the developed world  - at 5.2 per cent.    

 I am also proud of the improved outcomes we are seeing as a  Result of government’s decision to establish Job Services  Australia and Disability Employment Services - a point which  was recognised by the Activation Review.    

 Establishing Job Services Australia and Disability Employment  Services was a decision taken with the clear goal of addressing  the shortcomings of the former system.    

 Our current system does a much better job of directing  investment and services to those in the most need. In addition,  our decision to uncap services has done away with waiting lists.  A profound change, particularly for Australian’s with a disability.    

 Overall, Job Services Australia has placed almost 1.4 million  people in work and has resulted in a massive improvement in  the employment outcomes for the most disadvantaged people.    

 And uncapping Disability Employment Services has resulted in  a 45 per cent increase in the number of people with a disability  receiving services. We have also achieved an increase of over  80 per cent in the number of job placements for people with a  disability, compared to the former system.    

 In the past, we have taken hard decisions to reform  employment services because work has the power to change  lives. We believe that every Australian who can work should be  able to enjoy the challenges and dignity of having a job.    

 This commitment to making decisions in the best interests of  working Australians - and in the best interests of those  Australians who want to work - is unwavering.  

 

 In recent months we have announced the results of the first full  competitive tender for Disability Employment Services. And we  are currently in the process of changing the system for remote  service delivery to ensure that all Australians - no matter where  they live - can access the services they need.    

 But as a government, we are not prepared to rest on our  laurels. We are unashamedly pro-jobs. And I make no  apologies for pursuing changes to our employment services  system that will deliver better outcomes for Australian job  seekers.    

 Which is why I am excited to launch the ‘Employment Services  - building on success’ Issues Paper today. This marks the start  of a process which will seek your views - and the views of the  broader Australian community- about the best way to deliver  employment services. And it’s timely that we start this  conversation now. Not only in light of the OECD’s Activation  Review, but also to ensure that our policy settings and  directions are in place well before current contracts for JSA and  DMS expire in mid 2015.    

 The key themes of the issues paper include:   â¢ Meeting the needs of jobseekers   â¢ Working in partnership with employers   â¢ Stronger partnerships with other services  â¢ Identifying new ideas for a better system; and   â¢ Continuing to reduce red tape   

 We know that we need to address these issues because over  the last five years, government has taken note of what job  seekers, employers, providers and other stakeholders have  been saying about the current system.    

 And recently, the Issues Paper was framed with the assistance  of the 2015 Employment Services Reference Group - and I 

 would like to thank the group, some of whom are here today,  for their valuable input.    

 Addressing the themes of the Issues Paper is also important to  meeting future labour market challenges, including: an aging  population; the growth in jobs requiring degree-level  qualifications; youth unemployment; and increasing the  participation of mature age workers.    

 There are some key areas where the current system can be  improved.    

 Through better practice forums and migrant roundtables, I have  heard loud and clear that our current system does not always  work to encourage the kind of strong organisational  partnerships that will benefit jobseekers.    

 While there are many providers who do work closely with  mental health services, women’s shelters and ethnic  community groups, for instance, this is not always the case. We  know that for many people, the journey to work requires the  breaking down of several barriers.    

 For example, a refugee who is facing the shock of integrating  into a new community and adapting to new norms, who is  facing major language barriers, and who feels limited by  discrimination or prejudice; the first step toward training or work  is best taken with someone they can trust.    

 If a person is already engaged by a refugee association,  resettlement services or social workers, our employment  services system needs to be flexible enough to integrate  seamlessly with these organisations. There are great examples  that prove it can be done, but we need to work out the best way  to incentivise and value these kinds of wrap-around services.    

 And it’s not just partnerships with other services that matter.  We need to work much more closely with employers. Without  putting too finer point on it; we need jobs to place jobseekers.    

 Employers regularly tell me of the difficulties they face finding  the right people even for semi-skilled and entry-level positions.    

 And often, the same employers are not fully aware of what  government funded employment services can offer.    

 With many in the business community committed to breaking  cycles of unemployment and addressing disadvantage,  partnerships with business are a big opportunity.    

 However, we need to find ways to better coordinate interaction  with employers - particularly large employers with many work  sites.    

 We need to engage with industry to understand workforce  needs. We also need to develop partnerships that train and  support jobseekers, in return for an employer’s willingness to  recruit the long term unemployed and disadvantaged.    

 To further improve our system, we must also find ways to tailor  more services directly to the needs of individual jobseekers -  whether they be early school leavers, mature age workers or  from a culturally and linguistically diverse background.    

 We already have many excellent specialist services, and many  generalist providers that have developed great programs to  meet the specific needs of job seeker groups. But in some  areas, we are failing to meet the needs of some groups in the  most effective way.    

 To achieve all these goals, and ultimately get better outcomes,  we must also get our system design right.    

 Payments and incentives, contract structure, the way we  measure quality and how we assess job seekers are all  important.    

 Addressing some of the disadvantages of our competitive  system is also crucial; successful programs and good ideas  should be rapidly spread.    

 And following on from the Advisory Panel on Administration and  Accountability’s report earlier this year, I am absolutely  committed to reducing red tape, while maintaining  accountability for the use of public funds.   

 On all of these points, I am very pleased to say that this is a  conversation government and stakeholders are ready for.    

 Like many in the sector - government has been taking practical  steps towards the improvement of employment services. And  we will use what we have learnt to build a better system.    

 Over the last three and a half years, the Innovation Fund has  contributed $41 million to over 80 new and creative projects to  improve employment services outcomes.    

 And in the 2011-12 budget, we allocated $4.7 million for JSA  Demonstration Pilots. These 20 projects are focussed on  improving outcomes for the most disadvantaged jobseekers.    

 While the Demonstration Pilots have only recently commenced,  my Department is in the process of collating information about  the outcomes and effectiveness of the pilots and of the  Innovation Fund trials. This information is something I look  forward to sharing as part of this review.    

 I want the discussion about the future direction of employment  services to be an open discussion. I want to know what is  working and what barriers to success we need to overcome.    

 We shouldn’t be afraid of bright ideas, or brave ideas.    

 By starting now, government, stakeholders and the sector will  have the time we need to collaborate, innovate and hit-the-ground-running from 2015.    

 Submissions on the issues paper will close on 14 March 2013.    

 And in addition to the formal process of calling for independent  written submissions, my Department will also conduct forums  early next year - to provide an alternative avenue for  stakeholders to ask questions and put forward ideas.    

 This will build on the advice we receive from a range of groups  that have already been charged with providing input into this  process - including the Prime Minister’s Council on  Homelessness, the Australian Social Inclusion Board and the  Panel on Positive Aging.    

 In addition, I will be seeking an independent review JSA  performance data.    

 I also look forward to continued input from the 2015  Employment Service Reference Group, who I will also be  inviting to transition to the consultative group recommended by  the APESA ‘red tape’ report earlier this year.    

 Again, I would to extend my appreciation to John Martin and  the OECD for your work on the Activation Review, and for  taking the time to come to Australia and discuss the  implications of your report.    

 John, just look at what you have begun!    

 I am proud of our current employment services system, and I  am genuinely excited about what we can achieve from 2015.    

 Recently, social services, businesses and the employment  services peak groups have all lent their shoulder to the cause  of building a better system for Australian job seekers.    

 I welcome this commitment and I look forward to working with  all stakeholders as we build on our success to create an even  better employment services system.
