 Warren Truss  Deputy Prime Minister 

 Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development   

 Transcript   

 Press Conference   

 Nationals Party Room  Parliament House, Canberra   

 15 September 2015   

 Topics: Tony Abbott, Malcom Turnbull, Coalition Agreement,  Effects Test, Water to Ag Portfolio, MDB Plan, FTB B extension,  Mobile black spots, Side letter and EPBC Act.   

 I want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague Tony Abbott.   

 For the past two years Tony and I have led a government that delivered what it said it would deliver.   

 We abolished Labor’s unfair and counter-productive carbon and mining taxes. We put a stop to the  asylum seeker tragedy at sea. We put 300,000 Australians into gainful employment and began the  task of building the infrastructure for the 21st Century.   

 For our part, The Nationals have been focussed on delivering the investment and reform to back in  the regions’ growth and prosperity, capable of seizing the opportunities of the Asian Century.   

 Of course, before the election win in September 2013, we did almost four years together in  Opposition. Those were important and formative years, where no-one can deny Tony’s focus and  energy redefined what it is to be an Opposition leader and, in doing so, he brought us back from  political oblivion.   

 Liberal and Nationals owe Tony and Margie a tremendous debt of gratitude.   

 I congratulate Malcolm Turnbull on becoming the 29th Prime Minister of Australia. A new Coalition  Agreement has been negotiated, which addresses many of the policy issues facing the new  government.   

 It will underpin the relationship between the Liberal and National parties in the new government.  We have agreed a broad range of key policy issues, including:   

 Maintaining the existing policies in relation to climate change, carbon taxes and emissions reduction  targets.   

 Ongoing funding for communications technology, including for mobile phones and television black  spots. The establishment of a new jobs program to address areas of high regional unemployment.   

 Proper consideration by Cabinet of amendments to the Australian Competition and Consumer Act to  prevent abuse of market power.   

 Support for the Government's infrastructure investment program, including of course our major  commitment to Inland Rail.   

 We do we want to deal also with the financial barriers in accessing higher education for rural and  regional and remote students.   

 We want to support the commitment to the Northern Australia and the Agricultural White Papers  and our dams implementation policy.   

 And we've agreed to maintain the existing policy to refer the same-sex marriage issue to a plebiscite  of the people in our next term.   

 We're also seeking to provide additional support for stay-at-home parent families with a child below  the age of one.   

 We've also agreed to transfer responsibility for the water policy outcomes of the Department of the  Environment and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to the agricultural portfolio.   

 And these are important measures which identify some of the policy issues and how we will deal  with them in the term ahead.   

 It means that the Nationals are delivering for regional Australia. That we will have an agenda in the  new Coalition Government that will enable us to work constructively on those things that matter to  people who live outside the capital cities.   

 We are determined to have a constructive relationship with our Liberal partners and to continue the  kind of Government that is necessary to build confidence of the Australian people and deliver good  results to our nation.   

 Any questions?   

 QUESTION:         Mr Truss, on the effects test, is it that Cabinet has to pass it, or that Mr Turnbull has  it advocated inside Cabinet? Or is it just it has to be considered and not necessarily get up?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, as Mr Turnbull has said publicly, the issue is one that will have to be  dealt with by Cabinet. We are supportive of the Minister's proposals in relation to that issue, and  that is- but ultimately the decision will need to be made by Cabinet.   

 QUESTION:         Is it your understanding, Mr Truss, that the Prime Minister will advocate in favour of  the effects test? In the Cabinet discussion?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, he has indicated support for these measures in the past and we are  keen for this issue to be resolved by Cabinet as quickly as possible.   

 QUESTION:         Has he given you that assurance though, that he will support that…   

 WARREN TRUSS:              He's given the assurance that this issue will be dealt with by Cabinet. He's  made previous comments in relation to those matters. Mr Billson has liaised extensively with  industry, and we believe reforms to ensure that there is some kind of fairness in the marketplace are  absolutely essential and need to be addressed.   

 QUESTION:         [Indistinct] the water proposal [indistinct] is it all [indistinct]   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, the water policy outcomes are the Department of the Environment  and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be transferred to the Agriculture's portfolio. Now, the  Environment Minister will still obviously have control over water issues associated with the EPBC  Act. That's within his department, but this change will revert to the situation that has existed for  many, many decades, in relation to the way in which water policy was managed.   

 QUESTION:         [Interrupts] The Environment Minister loses all of the Murray Darling [indistinct]    

 WARREN TRUSS:              These particular issues will be managed and developed within the  Department of Agriculture and in the way that they've traditionally been done over previous  decades.   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              [Interrupts] Can I just add to that. I think it's important that as we go  forward to the dams proposal and with the issues that are so pertinent to people in regional  Australia, noting that the economic and social basis for so many towns in regional Australia is  premised on their access to water. And without water, they do not have an economy. This is very  evident in the south of the basin, round the Mildura, through the middle of the basin, all the way up  to Moree, to St George.    

 And we know that we have to make sure that these people - not only the farmers - but the motel  owners, the pub owners, the people who are employed in the town, all have a future. And I think  it's- we've been doing an incredible job here. We've managed to mitigate the effects that the Greens  and the Labor Party and the independents were going to do to the basin in previous government.  Remembering that Senator Sarah Hanson-Young started with wanting to take 6,000 gigalitres out of  the basin, which would have decimated the economy of all the people in the Basin.    

 And this gives a close association between the resource, which is the water, and the outcome, which  is farming production. And it's great also to have the Secretary of Agriculture here today, Daryl  Quinlivan, as well.    

 QUESTION:         Mr Joyce, one of the reasons the Liberals knocked off Tony Abbott was [indistinct] in  South Australia over the [indistinct] and car industry. The thing they get maddest about is the water.  How do you think they're going to react in South Australia to that's been transferred back to east  coast farmers? Where those lanes were ruining their end of the basin in the first place?   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              Well, a whole range of initiatives have been delivering water back into the  Basin from the Living Murray Initiative, the National Water Initiative. There's been a whole range of  state-based schemes as well that has delivered water back into the Basin. We understand that but  we've always stood by a triple bottom line which is both social outcomes, economic outcomes and  environmental outcomes and we're going to make sure that we stand by that because it's vitally  important that there's not much point having an environmental outcome if there's no one there to  enjoy it.   

 QUESTION:         Does the shift of water to the agriculture portfolio indicate you're flagging changes  to the Basin Plan?   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              The Basin Plan has - [indistinct] the - on the Basin Plan has now gone  through. It's gone through the Senate, I want to commend the work that's been done by the  Minister for Environment and Bob Baldwin in getting that Cap through. This is really a continuation  on the work and the belief that the National Party and the Liberal Party hold, and there's obviously  members of our little party fold who have a very strong interest in this to make sure that they have  an economic future and we're not - that we would be having a diametrically different position but it  provides a clear nexus between the source of the wealth, the source of the economy and the  outcome for water and the [indistinct].   

 QUESTION:         Will you plan to relocate the Murray Darling Basin Authority to a regional centre?   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              We've only just started [indistinct].   

 QUESTION:         Were there any things you thought that the Prime Minister did not agree to that...   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well…   

 QUESTION:         …or did you get everything you wanted?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well look, it's been an intense period of negotiations and there have been  concessions gained and there have been significant improvements, I believe, made in a whole range  of areas. What this document does is outline the basis of our policy approach to a whole range of  issues and, yes, in negotiations, there are things given and there are things that are not able to be  negotiated. That happens in tough negotiations and I would acknowledge the very good spirit in  which Mr Turnbull conducted those negotiations.   

 QUESTION:         Minister, what's the cost on the Budget of the FTB extension and have you proposed  offsetting savings to [indistinct]?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, there has been discussion about this issue previously with Scott  Morrison and the offer and the discussion about it is Budget neutral.   

 QUESTION:         So, you've got to way to pay for it?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              There's a way to pay for it, yes.   

 QUESTION:         How much more money is there for mobile phone black spots and over what period  of time?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well we have already provided substantial funding for mobile phone black  spots and the Government has already committed to another program. Now, we want that to  continue. There are issues associated with black spots and television reception that also need to be  addressed. There will be some improvement in regional communications as a result of the launch of  the NBN satellites next year. But it's important that we have, as time progresses, the capacity to be  able to ensure that new technology, when it arises is able to be delivered to people who live in  regional communities. There was once a very large ($2 billion) Telecommunications Fund which was  set up with the intention of it being used for guaranteeing technology advances in regional  communities. Now, that was raided by the Labor Party. We are spending tens of billions of dollars,  frankly, at the present time in delivering NBN to regional communities so we're very active in that  particular area of trying to ensure that all Australians have access to whatever new technology  comes along. Now, we want to have an assurance that that can happen into the future and I think  that this is a very important commitment that we've made jointly with our Liberal colleagues.   

 QUESTION:         Is there a dollar figure on the commitment?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, not specifically. We don't put dollar figures in an agreement of this  nature. What we're doing is talking about the policy direction we intend to take in the future.   

 QUESTION:         So, how long is the extended funding for? It sounds like annual funding? How long  has that been [indistinct]?  WARREN TRUSS:              Well the money in relation to the mobile phone black spots was extended  for a second year. There's money available for that now but we are looking for there to be a  continuing program. As for how long, I guess the life of this negotiation about the life of this  Coalition Agreement and we hope it's long.   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              Can I just say one thing, that the - what this does is build on what the  National Party has always been doing. Mobile phone towers in regional areas because the National  Party went in to bat to get the money from Howard onwards to make sure that the people have  access to that fundamental right to - if they have a crash to be able to call someone up, to be  connected to commerce, to be connected to their family. Every time you see a mobile phone tower  in a regional area, at the inception of that was the - was a policy decision and the driver of the  National Party. And although this agreement is tabulated, it does exactly what the National Party  does every day which is go in to bat for regional people, bargain for regional people and leverage out  deals for regional people and this is yet another statement that we are continually at the behest and  continually going to fight for regional people.   

 QUESTION:         So, just on that note, does the whole agreement - do you characterise the whole  agreement as an improvement on what you've had in the past and if that's the case, is this a more  muscular approach from the National Party from now on?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, we haven't had a side letter like this attached to the Coalition  Agreement previously. There have obviously been some policy differences between the new Leader  of the Liberals and the Nationals in the past so we want our relationship into the future to be built  on a sound basis and this document, I think, achieves that. We've received assurances from the  Liberal Leader in the way in which he will be approaching issues. I am comforted by those assurances  that some of the policy issues of the past are now resolved and that we will be able to work  constructively in the future.   

 QUESTION:         Mr Truss, sorry I just want to clarify the position of Mr Turnbull in relation to the  Family Tax Benefit B supplement for single income families. Has he given his personal support to  this, or is this essentially up to the Cabinet again? What's the formula there?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, obviously these sorts of things have to be decided by the Cabinet, but  this is an offer that has been on the table now for a little while, and we think it's a good one.   

 QUESTION:         Mr Joyce, are you disappointed you didn't get more powers such as the EPBC Act to  help deal with issues like the Shenhua Mine?   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              Well, I must admit we didn't get Treasury…   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              No, of course I'm very happy that what we have done as a party is as we  always do, except that this time it's [indistinct] but we are always going to bat for regional people,  we are always delivering for our people in the [indistinct], in the Cunnamullas, in the Mount Tom  Prices, in the Sheppartons. We are making sure that those on the peripheries are heard, we are  making sure that those on the peripheries have a voice down here in Canberra, and we are doing no  more than we do every other day of the week.   

 QUESTION:         There are some within your party who are saying you shouldn't rush into this  agreement. Do you think you did?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well we've been meeting night and day, there's been a lot of negotiations, a  lot of time dealing with particular issues, I think we've taken the time we needed. I appreciate that  did result in some delays to the swearing in of the Prime Minister and even Question Time today, but  I think that was necessary to secure the firm foundations that we have today.   

 QUESTION:         Were these discussions all post-the leadership change and weren't sounded out at  any stage in the last few weeks or months?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              No, certainly not. In fact I guess the leadership challenge came as a shock  and a surprise to all of us, but that was a matter for the Liberal Party. I wouldn't expect them to  consult us about those sorts of issues in advance just as we wouldn't consult them if we were  thinking about leadership changes.   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              And we're not!   

 QUESTION:         Mr Truss, you said you were shocked and surprised, you've obviously had to  negotiate a new agreement [indistinct] very quickly. Do you think that the Government has made  the same mistake that the former Labor government made in 2010?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, the Liberal Party choose their leader. They have made their decision.   

 QUESTION:         [Interrupts] But you form a government together?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              And we have formed a government. We have formed a government based  now on the discussions that we've had, and that gives us a solid base to the future. I think that we as  a Party want to make sure that we can continue to deliver for regional Australia, that's our priority  and we have now put in place arrangements which will ensure that we can do that with the new  Liberal leader. We obviously had a very good relationship with Mr Abbott, and for that matter Mr 

 Howard and others before him, Brendan Nelson, and now I am confident we'll build a good  relationship with Mr Turnbull.   

 QUESTION:         But so you feel [indistinct] that you've actually got more out of a progressive leader  than you have out of a conservative leader?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well I think we've got a record of achievement with each of the leaders,  there are many things that have been particularly important to regional Australia that have been  achieved with this government, such as a $50 billion infrastructure program, the dams program, the  white paper on agriculture, the Northern Australia paper, the inland rail, all those sort of things I  know are important to the Liberal Party but they have been issues that matter a great deal to us as  representatives of regional Australia, and we are confident now with this agreement that what was  achieved under the previous government can continue and come to fruition with the arrangement  with Mr Turnbull.   

 QUESTION:         Are you satisfied that Mr Turnbull has now changed significantly enough since 2009  when he was last leader to understand and consult with the National Party effectively enough to  form good government?   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Well, I think he has given very clear signals both in the Parliament today and  also in our discussions and clearly to his own party that he has learned from past experiences, that  he is the wiser for them, and that he needs to engage all sections of his own Party and the Coalition  partners if we are going to have a constructive and strong government into the future. Now I think  he started off well in that regard and I complement him, and look forward to working with him  through the various issues. We won't always agree in the future, there will be more ambition that  we will have for new policy areas in the future and we will have to work hard to achieve them just as  other backbench members and ministers have to in developing a policy and trying to get the Budget  allocation especially in these difficult economic times. And it is because we've got those challenging  times it is so important that we have a strong, smooth working government, and I think the time  we've taken to develop this agreement today will provide lasting benefits for the new Government  and, particularly, for all Australia.   

 BARNABY JOYCE:              Thank you very much   

 WARREN TRUSS:              Thank you.
