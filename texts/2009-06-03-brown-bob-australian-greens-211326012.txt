 Bob Brown   Reveal Beijing’s campaign on Uighurs - Brown to  Rudd  Media Release | Spokesperson Bob Brown

 The Australian government should make public Beijing's pressure campaign to stop Australia taking Guantanamo 

 Bay inmates, who are Uighurs, found totally innocent of any charge, Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown said 

 today. 

 The Australian foreign ministry says ‘it is not our practice to divulge the content of discussions with foreign 

 governments', but China's government is publicly demanding that the Uighurs are sent back to trial in China and, 

 no doubt, further ill-treatment. 

 "On the eve of twentieth anniversary of the massacre of democrats in Tiananmen Square, the Rudd government 

 should not be coerced to deny these men joining their compatriot Uighur community in Australia," Senator Brown 

 said.
