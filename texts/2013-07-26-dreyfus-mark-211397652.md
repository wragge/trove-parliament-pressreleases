 SPEECH    

 Australia, Human Rights and the International Rule of Law     

 CASTAN CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ANNUAL CONFERENCE   MELBOURNE  26 JULY 2013    

 I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, and pay my respects to  their elders, both past and present.    

 Today I want to speak about the history and current practice of Australia’s pursuit of human  rights, in the context of our nation’s broader engagement with international law and  institutions.  I will be arguing that because the pursuit of human rights involves the constant  and delicate balancing of what are, at times, competing policy objectives, it is essential that the  pursuit of human rights occur in the context of an open, constructive and honest debate  between nations in the international sphere, and between governments, civil society, and the  wider public in the domestic sphere.     

 But before I get into the details of my speech, I want to briefly reminisce about the late Ron  Castan, a friend and role model for me, and a man whose influence on human rights in our  country has been both deep and lasting.  I think it is important that those of us who are  involved in public life remember the legacy of those who have made lasting contributions to the  lives of individuals and communities, and in the case of a figure like Ron, to our nation’s history.    

 Ron is perhaps best known for his work fighting for justice for Indigenous Australians,  particularly for his advocacy in the historic Mabo case before the High Court. 

 

 In working with Eddie Mabo to overturn the offensive legal fiction of terra nullius, Ron sought  to redress a deep injustice, as old as European settlement in this country, and to set in place the  legal foundations on which our current native title system has been built.     

 It is interesting to note that unlike in the United States, where seminal Supreme Court case  names like Roe v Wade, Miranda, and Brown v Board of Education form part of the political  lexicon, few Australians would know the names of even the most significant High Court cases.   Mabo is a welcome exception to this tendency, with the name now closely associated with the  idea of ‘justice’.      

 I think that Ron must share the credit for this, not only with Eddie Mabo and the other plaintiffs  and counsel, but also with the writers of The Castle. I’m sure there are few lawyers who have  not secretly daydreamed about finishing a case with the immortal words of Dennis Denuto,  who in summing up the grounds for his constitutional challenge to compulsory acquisition  declared to the court: “… it’s the Constitution, it’s Mabo, it’s justice, it’s law, it’s the vibe.”    

 In our case against Japan’s so-called scientific whaling programs at The Hague earlier this  month, our legal team did briefly consider whether a reference to ‘the vibe’ might usefully  diffuse some of the tension in the Court.  However, with Professor Hillary Charlesworth the only  Australian judge on the 16 member bench of the International Court of Justice we, somewhat  regretfully, decided against it.    

 The second Mabo case is particularly significant in the context of this address, because it is a  clear example of international human rights laws positively influencing Australia’s domestic  legal system.  In his judgment in that case, Justice Brennan’s said:   The common law does not necessarily conform with international law, but international 

 law is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law,  especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights.     

 Notwithstanding the historic nature of the High Court’s ruling in Mabo, the outcome did not  end the debate on native title in our nation.  The Keating Government’s native title laws, that  were essential in transforming the High Court’s ruling into a national system, were themselves  the subject of another fierce struggle, this time in the sphere of public policy.      

 Many who engaged in that debate were genuinely seeking to develop a policy that would fairly  balance the newly-recognised rights of Indigenous Australians with the rights of other  Australians.  However, I am sure that many of you remember that some conservative  opponents of native title at that time engaged in a fear mongering political campaign of the  most dishonest and - I’m sad to say - now familiar kind.  But we did have the debate, and  notwithstanding attempts by some to derail the native title reforms with fear and  disinformation, the situation for Indigenous Australians has been significantly improved as a  consequence of the historic reforms that we, as a democratic nation, argued and ultimately  accepted. 

 

 Of course, I am well aware that despite these historic reforms the fight for Indigenous justice  continues, with huge and ongoing challenges in health, in education, and the complex and  often fraught relationships between our first Australians and the justice system itself.  And  despite amendments to our Constitution in 1967 that removed the prohibition on counting  Indigenous Australians in the census, many would say that the silence of the Australian  Constitution regarding first Australians remains an injustice that needs correcting.      

 It is my intention that Australia continue to honour and to build on Ron Castan’s legacy of  Indigenous justice.  In this regard, I firmly believe that Constitutional recognition of Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander peoples is an important measure that we should pursue.  It would  strengthen our Constitution as a unifying document by properly extending the recognition of  our first Australians beyond the common law and legislation into the legal bedrock of our  nation.    

 Our Constitution should be a living document.  Of course it reflects the times in which it was  drafted, but to remain relevant and respected our Constitution should also reflect the  fundamental shifts that have occurred in our society in over a century since Federation, and  that that have made us a more modern, progressive and unified nation.  

 The framers of Australia’s constitutional arrangements could scarcely have imagined the  developments that have occurred within our nation, and also in the international community,  since World War II.      

 In the aftermath of the Second World War Australia became deeply involved in forging a new  international system, and in the development of human rights law that occurred under the  United Nations framework.  It was the Labor Party’s Doc Evatt who chaired the United Nations  General Assembly when it adopted the Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights.  Not only that, but Australia was one of eight nations to draft that central human  rights document.      

 Since that time, international human rights law has grown in both scope and sophistication.   The two UN Covenants which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966 -  the first on civil and political rights - and the second on economic, social and cultural rights -  have been particularly significant.      

 These developments in international law reflect a change in the status of human rights  principles, which are now increasingly considered as binding between states. It is no longer  assumed that states can do as they please within their jurisdictions and escape international  scrutiny based on the once paramount doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of UN  member states.      

 Developments in international human rights law during the 1960s and 1970s coincided with  changes within Australia, including the end of the White Australia Policy, reforms to address  racial discrimination against Indigenous Australians, and domestic measures to oppose 

 apartheid in South Africa.  In 1966 Australia signed up to the Convention on the Elimination of  All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and Australia was one of the first countries to sign the 1979  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 

 

 Gough Whitlam’s Government was central - and enormously energetic - in efforts to bring  Australia into the modern era of human rights.  As Prime Minister, Whitlam was committed to  Australia’s engagement in multilateral institutions, and he and Lionel Murphy were responsible  for driving the introduction of federal protections against racial discrimination.     

 Indeed, in giving the Lionel Murphy Memorial lecture this year I was somewhat humbled to be  reminded of the remarkable range of reforms that Lionel Murphy instituted in just three years  as Attorney-General. His first act was to abolish the death penalty.  Within a year he had  introduced a national system of legal aid, an institution that quickly became pivotal in providing  justice for the disadvantaged in our nation, and which celebrated its 40th anniversary just  yesterday. Murphy also established the Law Reform Commission and the Institute of  Criminology, and proposed the establishment of a general Federal Court.  He also found time to  introduce national trade practices legislation, and he was instrumental in modernizing family  law in this country, as the driving force behind the Family Law Act 1975.       

 I also acknowledge that Malcolm Fraser’s Government also demonstrated respect for our  international obligations by increasing Australia’s refugee intake, particularly from Asia, and by  working to oppose apartheid in South Africa.    

 Australia’s active engagement in international human rights continued throughout most of the  1980s and 1990s.  One notable example of the growing linkages between international and  domestic human rights standards occurred following Australia’s ratification of the Optional  Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, when a Tasmanian by the  name of Mr Nicholas Toonen brought a complaint to the United Nations Human Rights  Committee against laws criminalising homosexuality in his state.  In the landmark decision of  Toonen v Australia in 1994, the Committee found that adult consensual sexual activity in  private is covered by the concept of “privacy”, and that Mr Toonen was affected by the  continued existence of the Tasmanian laws, which continuously and directly interfered with his  privacy, despite their lack of recent enforcement.    

 In response to the recommendation of the Human Rights Committee, the Keating Government  passed an Act effectively voiding the Tasmanian legislation.    

 Throughout the 1990s the Australian Government worked hard for the establishment of the  International Criminal Court.  Some of you will remember that with the Court’s Statute finally  agreed at an international level, John Howard then wavered at the point of Australia’s  ratification. Once again, a fierce domestic debate erupted as many within Liberal Party,  particularly Bronwyn Bishop, opposed ratification. I expect that some of you were also part of  that debate, though probably not in Ms Bishop’s corner. Fortunately for Australia’s  international reputation, wiser heads prevailed, and in 2002 Australia ratified the Statue of the 

 International Court that it had fought so hard to establish.  In bringing perpetrators of human  rights atrocities to account, the International Criminal Court has played an important role in  upholding human rights standards and strengthening the international rule of law.    

 In order to have a productive dialogue about human rights and to effect meaningful change, it  is important that nations listen respectfully and engage constructively with the views expressed  by others in the international community. Although Australia was closely involved in East  Timor’s independence struggle in 1999, and was active in the suspension of Zimbabwe from the  Commonwealth in 2002, under John Howard’s government Australia started to withdraw from  its traditionally constructive approach to multilateralism, and became notably less open to  constructive criticism from international institutions. UN Special Rapporteurs were made to feel  unwelcome, Australia became antagonistic toward international human rights committees, and  many non-government organisations involved in upholding the international rule of law and  holding governments to account were treated with disdain.      

 Indeed, within Australia attempts were made to gag non-government organisations that were  critical of the federal government.  For example, in 2006 the Australian Tax Office revoked the  charitable tax status of an NGO called Aid/Watch, on the basis that it was engaged in advocacy  for a more efficient and effective use of Australian foreign aid, and this advocacy was not a  proper ‘charitable’ purpose.  The effect of this decision not only threatened the funding base of 

 Aid/Watch, but had a chilling effect on freedom of political communication throughout the  charity sector, as organisations that had long advocated for policy changes were suddenly  unwilling to speak out lest they have their funding base undermined by similar rulings.  A four  year legal battle followed, ultimately reaching the High Court in 2010 where I am pleased to say  that the High Court majority reversed the decision of the ATO by throwing out the narrow and  archaic definition of charitable purposes that had been used to try to shut down criticism of the  government.     

 I have recently been speaking publicly about contemporary attempts by conservative state  governments to silence the voices of the institutions that constitute our civil society, with the  governments of Queensland and New South Wales blatantly trying to prohibit what they define  as political advocacy by independent organisations they fund.  I consider these attempts to  prohibit political activities by independent legal and other community organisations to be  inimical to the freedom of political communication that is a characteristic and strength of  Australia’s robust and open democracy.      

 That is why in extending joint-funding arrangements for community legal services with the NSW  Government this year I refused to accept the constraints on political activities that the NSW  Government sought to impose.  And that is why in May this year our Government passed the  Not-for-Profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill, which came into operation in June.  This law  prohibits and invalidates clauses in Commonwealth agreements that seek to limit or restrict  not-for-profit entities from advocating on Commonwealth policy issues.    

 I will not go into further detail on these matters here this morning. But the fact is that despite  raising this unacceptable anti-democratic behaviour several times in recent months, I have seen  no indication of a change of policy from either the New South Wales or Queensland  governments, and no sign that the federal Opposition would, should they win government, do  any different than their conservative state counterparts.  Indeed, if Senator Brandis’ comments  are anything to go by, it appears that if elected the federal Opposition would return to policies  of suppression of political advocacy by non-government organisations that the Howard  Government once pursued, and that their conservative state colleagues are now engaged in.     

 As I said at the outset of my comments this morning, to engage constructively in the challenge  of building a more just nation, consistent with evolving standards of human rights, our nation  needs to be able to conduct an honest and constructive debate on the policies that are  required. It is inevitable that reforms to better protect human rights will spark debate within  communities, whether it is a community of citizens arguing about reforms to domestic law, or  the community of nations, negotiating international treaties. That is as it should be.    

 At the international level, the human rights regime is built upon dialogue amongst peers.      

 And that is what our Government has been engaged in. For example:  â¢         The Australian Government has signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against  Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and we are now  working with the States to make ratification a reality.  

 â¢         Our Government has acceded to the complaints mechanisms provided by Optional  Protocols concerning women and people with disabilities, demonstrating our willingness to  have our nation’s standards and practices scrutinized. 

 â¢         Our Government has announced Australia’s support for the Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples, and we expect that document to help guide Australia’s domestic policy  development.   

 â¢         We are an active participant in the Universal Periodic Review process conducted by the UN  Human Rights Council, and we have built our own National Human Rights Action Plan  around the vast majority of recommendations of that Review into Australia.   

 

 These measures demonstrate our willingness as a nation to accept criticism and to engage  constructively with the ideas that are generated from international scrutiny of our country.  It is  an approach that we encourage other countries to adopt.    

 And Australian candidates continue to be supported by our Government for important  international positions, as we believe that Australia should be actively engaged in deliberations  amongst nations.  For example, Ron McCallum is now the Vice-Chair of the UN Committee on  the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and Megan Davis was recently reappointed to the UN  Permanent Forum on Indigenous issues.  We are supporting the nomination to the  International Court of Justice of Professor James Crawford, a superb lawyer with an excellent  sense of humour, who I just recently had the honour of appearing with in our case against  Japan before the International Court of Justice. 

 

 Our Government has also supported the appointment in May 2013 of former High Court judge  Michael Kirby as chair of the Commission of Inquiry into human rights abuses in the Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea. 

 

 Australia has also been active in negotiating and co-sponsoring numerous resolutions in the UN  General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Committee across the breadth of thematic issues,  from the rights of people with disabilities to the global abolition of the death penalty.     

 Finally, I note that with our sound multilateral record of achievement to cite, we now have a  solid basis to launch Australia’s candidacy for the Human Rights Council 2018-20 term.  This is  the first time that Australia has sought membership of the Council and reflects our strong  commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights.   

 

 Our Government has worked hard to re-engage Australia as an active and constructive  participant in the international community. And we believe that we have a responsibility as a  mature democracy, and particularly as a member of the United Nations Security Council, to  continue to press ahead with the international human rights agenda. 

 

 In addition to our positive international engagement in human rights, our Government’s  legislative and programmatic record also demonstrates a constructive approach to promoting  human rights within Australia.    

 For example, the Parliament’s proper role examining the compatibility of new and existing  legislation with human rights standards has recently been formalised through the creation of a  specific Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and by the requirement, introduced  by federal Labor in 2011, that Bills and legislative instruments be accompanied by a Statement  of Compatibility with human rights.  This second measure requires that every time a Minister  proposes a law, he or she must be prepared to permanently place upon the public record a  Statement detailing how the laws being proposed are compatible with Australia’s obligations  under seven core human rights treaties.      

 Our government has also been working to consolidate Australia’s anti-discrimination laws -  laws which have a noble origin in international human rights treaties, but which now appear in  five partially overlapping pieces of legislation, and so have become complicated and confusing.   The Government is now working through the technical issues presented by the Senate  Committee’s recent report.    

 And while this work of consolidation has been occurring, I am proud that our Government has  introduced and passed long-overdue protections against discrimination on the grounds of  sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status.      

 Today I have outlined some of the important work that is being undertaken by our Government  to further the international human rights agenda, while also improving human rights  protections in the domestic sphere.    

 I have also been arguing today that the pursuit of improved human rights standards will  inevitably generate debate. It is my firm view that constructive debate and criticism is beneficial  to policy development in both the international and domestic arenas, and that debate and  criticism should be encouraged by governments, not crushed as dissent.      

 The protestors out the front of today’s event are a case in point.     

 And in that regard, I would like to take this opportunity to address the issue of our nation’s  asylum seeker policy, that has once again gripped our national debate in the last week, and that  is relevant to the themes that I have been discussing this morning.    

 I do not want to even try to analyse every aspect of the issues at hand, but I do want to briefly  give you my views about what I know is a vexed matter for all compassionate Australians,  including probably everybody here today. I have no doubt that David Manne will have  something to say about the issue too, when he addresses you this afternoon.    

 For more than a decade, since political bipartisanship and measured debate on the issue of  asylum seekers was, I would say, deliberately destroyed by the Howard Government for its  political advantage, the treatment of refugees coming to Australia has polarised our country.   Last Friday the Prime Minister announced a policy that has been designed to end the traffic in  human suffering driven by people smugglers.  The subsequent debate about the merits of this  policy has, understandably, been fiery.    

 Clearly, our Government has taken a firm policy position.  But the reality of recent years is that  the situation has changed dramatically, and with that change more than a thousand people  have drowned in the ocean trying to reach this country since 2000.  More died yesterday when 

 a boat sank in Indonesian waters. This new situation is unacceptable, and we can not pretend  to ourselves that this appalling toll of deaths at sea will not continue to occur without a  significant change in policy by the Australian Government.     

 The policy announced by the Prime Minister last Friday is aimed squarely at removing the  incentive that induces the desperate to make the dangerous voyage to Australia.  And with that  incentive removed, the policy aims to fundamentally undermine the business of the smugglers  who exploit the desperation of their human cargo.    

 Obviously the decision to close this route for those wanting to seek asylum in Australia was only  taken after careful deliberation and years of debate during which many options were  considered.  I say again, the new status quo of ongoing - and very likely increasing - deaths at  sea is intolerable, and all prior efforts to find policy measures that would stop the dangerous  flow of boats have been unsuccessful.  

 

 I would also point out that the Government will be implementing these new arrangements in a  manner that is consistent with our international obligations. Papua New Guinea is a signatory  to the UN Convention on Refugees and will remove its reservations to the Convention for  people covered by this arrangement. Asylum seekers found to be refugees would be resettled  in PNG with appropriate support from the PNG Government.     

 Those transferred and accommodated in PNG will be treated with dignity and respect and in  accordance with human rights standards. They will not be returned to their place of  persecution, and the obligations of the Refugees Convention will be adhered to.  

 

 There is another aspect to the moral imperative for this policy change, which is that our  international legal obligations should not be seen through a parochial lens that seeks to confine  our responsibilities to only what happens within our borders.  The Office of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees has put in place processes to deal with the international issue  of refugees, and the actions of the people smugglers completely subverts that system.   Australia cannot claim to be responsibly engaged with the international frameworks set up to  deal with refugees if we are willing to tolerate the subversion of that framework by illegal  people smugglers, who have created a dangerous and Hobbesian system, driven not by human  rights obligations, but by the pursuit of profit.      

 There are thousands of refugees waiting in UN camps who do not get on boats, in some cases  because they are so poor that such journeys are beyond contemplation.  They are amongst the  neediest of refugees, awaiting their chance to come to Australia under our humanitarian  program.  And for every boat arrival that we now say no to receiving here, a place is made for a  refugee who is patiently - and desperately - waiting for their chance in a UN camp.      

 So let me be clear: Not one less refugee will be taken into Australia as a consequence of our  arrangement with Papua New Guinea.  And those that we do take in will be those who have  been assessed through the processes established by the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees.    

 Which brings me to another important fact that is often lost in the current political noise: our  Government has recently increased our humanitarian intake by 7,000, the largest increase in 30  years, so that Australia now accepts 20,000 refugees a year.  Of the 22 countries with a  dedicated resettlement program under the Refugee Convention, our nation is now in the top  three for refugee settlement, along with Canada and the US.  And our Government will consider  another increase - to 27, 000 refugees - if there is now a significant decline in the deadly  voyages by boat.    

 The polarised, passionate and - regrettably, often disgracefully opportunistic - nature of the  debate about asylum seekers over the last decade has led many positions to become so  entrenched that the important facts I have just outlined are often obscured.  Consequently, the 

 realities that we must responsibly confront with effective policy solutions have become harder  to see.      

 In this regard the federal Opposition have once again been engaged in reprehensibly  irresponsible, dishonest and self-serving tactics motivated it seems by the sole purpose of  furthering their partisan political interests.  Of course there should be a genuine debate about  how to best respond to the immensely difficult challenges that Australia faces in this area.  But  the Liberal Party is entirely absent from that debate, and are instead back to their old playbook  of fear-mongering, trashing diplomatic protocols, and throwing up three word slogans in place  of considered policies, the latest of which is the risible and duplicitous ‘Operation Sovereign  Borders’, a slogan clearly designed to once again dangerously conflate what are humanitarian  and law enforcement issues with matters of national security.     

 I will have more to say about these issues over the coming weeks.  Indeed, I have been  wrestling with these issues for my entire professional life, and I welcome constructive  contributions from anyone, anywhere in our community, regarding this enormously difficult  policy area, and the questions that it raises. 

 

 But I strongly believe we can and must rebuild our confidence and pride in our nation’s  humanitarian programs, and I sincerely hope that we will find a way to build a lasting,  bipartisan approach to these difficult issues, that could become a symbol of our maturity as a  nation.     

 As I said when addressing at the Sydney Institute last week, a robust, open and honest  conversation between those with differing viewpoints creates the energy that drives a vibrant  and creative democracy.  Viewed through one eye the world has no depth, but with the parallax  created by differing viewpoints, we perceive the world and the challenges that we face in three  dimensions, and our nation is made richer - and wiser - for that.     

 Thank you very much.
