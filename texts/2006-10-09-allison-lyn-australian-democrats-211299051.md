 Government stance on climate and Pacific abominable

 The Democrats agree with Minister Campbell that Australia should help refugees avoid becoming  homeless as a result of climate change but challenge the Ministers callous disregard for people of  neighbouring countries who have no choice but to seek shelter elsewhere.   

 "Droughts, storm surges and associated salination of soil and water are already causing people in low-lying Pacific countries to seek higher ground just so they can grow food," Senator Lyn Allison  commented today.   

 Pacific Island Nations threatened by climate change already deal with rising sea levels, increasingly  violent storms and threats to food production and supplies of clean water.   

 But for the tiny coral atolls of Kiribati, less than 3 meters high, drinking water will be the least of their  problems. The Kiribati Government estimates that 10,000 of their people will need to be resettled in the  next 20 years.    

 "Australia should be an option but there is no end in sight to this Governments hardline stand against  climate change re refugees," said Senator Lyn Allison.   

 "Australia is the highest greenhouse emitter per capita but this Government has dragged its feet on  reducing emissions. There can be no argument that we have a moral responsibility to help neighbouring  countries.   

 "Minister Campbell should put rhetoric aside and commit to taking climate-change refugees as well as  work with the International community and the UN to develop an action plan.    

 "The Australian Government must act immediately to help Pacific Nations by working with the  international community to bring down emissions by 60 per cent by 2050.   

 "A good first step would be to sign on to the Kyoto protocol, another, would be to introduce a carbon  price signal in Australia.    

 "The Government has run out of excuses for not acting more quickly on climate change.    

 "Increasing overseas aid to .5 per cent and integrating climate change considerations into overseas  development assistance programs would show that the Howard government is making an effort,"  concluded Senator Allison.
