 TRANSCRIPT  30 July 2013  Doorstop 

 International Serious and Organised Crime Conference  Brisbane   

 E+OE 

 Topics:  Organised crime, Asylum seekers, Sydney shootings 

 QUESTION:                           You mentioned about how organised crime's more  powerful than ever. I mean, should people look at this  and think that the bad guys are winning? 

 JASON CLARE:                      No. I think the evidence shows that law enforcement  is more successful than ever before, seizing more  drugs than ever before and that's because they're  now working together in a way that they haven't in  the past. And they're harnessing the power of criminal  intelligence. 

                                                Five years ago we were seizing half the amount of 

 drugs in air cargo that we are now, and that's because  instead of just randomly x-raying containers or  parcels, they're now conducting an intelligence  analysis of everything that comes through the air on  planes in air cargo. 

                                                So by being smarter about it, we've got a better chance 

 of seizing more drugs and catching more criminals.  But what this report shows is that this battle is not  won at all, that the cancer that is organised crime is  growing. There's more work that needs to be done,  and we've got to continue to change the way in which  we fight organised crime as organised crime changes  as well.  

                                                And one of the big challenges we face right now and 

 we will continue to face into the future is the risk that  technology creates for all Australian citizens.  Organised crime through the power of the computer  system, through the power of the internet, can now  reach right into our homes. You can buy drugs over  the internet and have them arrive at your doorstep.  But you can also have your life savings stolen from  you without leaving your door.  

                                                So big challenges ahead. The purpose of this report is 

 to warn the Australian public about the risks that  organised crime creates and to work together with the  people of Australia to beat them. 

 QUESTION:                           Can I ask you what you made of the Opposition's plan  to expand the [indistinct] of tents, et cetera on Nauru.  

 JASON CLARE:                      Well, I guess the point I'd make here is that the 

 Government's plan is that people who arrive in  Australia by boat will be transferred, processed and  resettled in Papua New Guinea. We need to remove  the incentive for people to get onto a boat. The risk of  drowning in the middle of the ocean hasn't put people 

 off. Transferring people to Nauru where they're  processed and then could potentially be resettled in  Australia hasn't put people off. You've got to remove  the incentive to get onto a boat. People are buying a  ticket to Australia from people smugglers because  they want to live in Australia. So the agreement that  we've struck with PNG says that you'll be processed in  PNG and you'll be settled in PNG. You'll live in PNG. 

                                                The difference between that and what the Opposition 

 is proposing is that you'll be processed in Nauru but  you could be resettled in Australia. So it doesn't  remove the incentive for people to get onto a boat.  We know that last time this happened, that over 90  per cent of people that were found to be refugees  were settled in Australia or New Zealand. Now people  smugglers know this. They tell people, don't worry,  you'll go to Nauru. You'll stay there for a while, and  then you'll end up in Australia or you might end up in  New Zealand.  

                                                We've got to take away the product they're trying to 

 sell, which is living in Australia. That's why the  agreement with PNG is so critical. It's not processing  and then settling in Australia, it's processing and then  settling in PNG. And that's what's important. We're  going to remove the incentive for people to risk their  lives on the high seas.  

 QUESTION:                           The Fijian Government has criticised the situation. It  says Australia is throwing around its weight and it will  destabilise PNG and its social environment. How do  you respond to that?  

 JASON CLARE:                      Well, I'm not going to respond to the comments of  other countries, other than to say this; that this is a  regional problem. And anybody who thinks that you  can solve it by making a decision in Canberra is wrong,  is naive. If we're going to fix this, you've got to work  together with the countries of the region; the  countries where people are fleeing, the countries  where people are transiting through and the countries  where people are seeking to live.  

                                                We've got a problem. People smugglers making lots of 

 money, selling people tickets to get on a boat and risk  their life to come and live in Australia. PNG have got  challenges as well, with health and education, law and  order. This is about two next-door neighbours, two  friends, helping each other out. PNG are helping us to  remove the incentive for people to get on a boat and  risk their lives and we're helping PNG with the  challenges that they confront. That's what friends and  neighbours do. 

 QUESTION:                           Thirteen hundred people have actually arrived since  you announced that PNG solution. How many more  do you expect are on the horizon? 

 JASON CLARE:                      I expect that more people will risk their lives, that  more people will buy tickets off people smugglers,  because people smugglers are telling people lies. The  latest reports I've got are that people smugglers are  saying, get in quick before the first plane takes off to  PNG. Get in quick before the Parliament passes laws,  or get in quick before the High Court makes a decision  on this.  

                                                Any possible lie you can think of, people smugglers are 

 telling people right now in Indonesia, to encourage  people to get onto boats, because they make a lot of  money out of this. That's why the Prime Minister's  made it clear - you shouldn't expect that the number  of people getting onto boats is going to stop in an  instant. There are a lot of people in PNG, some of  whom have paid the whole price for the transfer to  Australia, some of whom have paid half the price. And  people smugglers are exploiting that.  

 QUESTION:                           Are you aware of any in transit right now? 

 JASON CLARE:                      No, I'm not. 

 QUESTION:                           Just back to that idea of the Liberal Party's plan beingâ€¦  involving resettlement in Australia, does this  effectively mean that Labor's plan is a bit more  hardline? And is this idea unprecedented? 

 JASON CLARE:                      No, I'm not interested in hard, soft, left, right. I'm  interested in what works. Now what we know is this;  people are getting onto a boat and risking their lives,  risking the lives of their families, their little children,  because they want to live in Australia. So if you're  going to create a policy to stop people dying, you've  got to remove the incentive to get onto a boat in the  first place. 

                                                If they want to come - if they're getting on a boat and 

 risking their lives because they want to live in  Australia, you need a policy that says, you won't live in 

 Australia, and that's what this policy does. That's why  it's right. It's not hard or soft. It's about trying to stop  people dying by saying, if you get onto a boat there's  no point, you're not buying a ticket to Australia, you'll  live in Papua New Guinea.  

 QUESTION:                           How long before you expect to see a downturn in the  number of boats that are heading out? 

 JASON CLARE:                      I'd give you the same answer I just gave then. People  smugglers are going to continue to test our resolve.  Well, they can try in vain because we will fully  implement this policy.  

 QUESTION:                           There have been 70 shootings in Sydney so far this 

 year. What aren't you doing right? 

 JASON CLARE:                      The people of Western Sydney, people of Sydney are  worried about this, and I'm worried about it as well. I  represent the people of Western Sydney. I'm worried  that a day will come when an innocent person is  caught in the cross-fire, where an innocent person is  shot, not another member of an outlaw motorcycle  gang. You've got a war going on in the streets of  Sydney between different motor cycle gangs, fighting  over drugs and fighting over turf. And it is a serious  challenge, one that I'm very worried about.  

                                                I think the New South Wales Police do a terrific job, but 

 there are things that we can do as a Federal  Government, with federal law enforcement agencies  to help them out, working closely together. That's why 

 the National Anti-Gang Taskforce that we're setting up  right now is so important. Not just Federal Police and  the Crime Commission helping the New South Wales  Police, but also the Tax office, Centrelink and  Immigration, working together to give Police on the  ground the extra support that they need.  

                                                In addition to that, I think there are things that we can 

 do to strip the assets of criminals. A lot of police that I  talk to in Western Sydney say there are criminals  driving around in flash cars that don't have a job. We  can change the balance of power on the street here if  we take their assets off them. That's why I'm  campaigning for national unexplained wealth laws,  tougher laws, stronger laws to take criminal assets of  serious criminals.  

                                                We can also take the guns off them. You know, 

 ultimately this is a gun fight that's happening in  Western Sydney. You've got a quarter of a million  guns on the streets of Australia, in the hands of  criminals right now, and they're using those weapons  to fight out these turf battles to sell drugs. A lot of  guns out there - most of them are guns that have  been there since before the Port Arthur Massacre, or  guns that are stolen from legitimate owners.  

                                                One of the things I've said today is we need to give 

 Police more power to go in and seize those guns.  Often, police will know who the criminals are, but  don't have the powers to stop and search them at any  time to take the weapons off them. 

                                                In South Australia, they've got these powers. They're 

 called firearm prohibition orders, the power to  randomly search criminals that have got a record of  violence, a record of firearms crime, the power to stop  them at any time and search them for weapons,  whether it's in their home, in their car, on the street,  in someone else's home, in someone else's car. These  are laws that the Commissioner of the South Australia  Police tells me are working. And they're laws that I've  said to Police Ministers across the country, we should  implement from coast to coast. 

 Okay, thanks very much.
