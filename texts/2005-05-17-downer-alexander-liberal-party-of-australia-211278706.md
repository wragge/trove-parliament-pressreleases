 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER FA67             17  May  2005  

 

 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO   THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   

 The  Government  will  recommend  to  the  Governor-General  that  Mr  Dennis  Richardson  AO  be   nominated as Australia's next Ambassador to the United States of America.     

 Mr Richardson is Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).  He  has  made  a  major  contribution  to  Australia’s  security  in  this  role,  especially  since  11  September   2001, and will be a highly effective Ambassador to the United States.   

 Prior  to  taking  up  his  current  position,  Mr  Richardson  was  Deputy  Secretary,  Department  of   Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1993-96), First Assistant Secretary, Social Policy Division,  Department  of  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet  (1992-93),  Head  of  the  Review  of  the  Intelligence   Community (1992), Principal Adviser to the Prime Minister (1990-1991), First Assistant Secretary,  International  Division,  Department  of  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet  (1988-90),  Assistant  Secretary,   Foreign  Affairs  Branch,  Department  of  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet  (1987-88),  and  Assistant   Secretary,  Refugee  and  Humanitarian  Branch,  Department  of  Immigration  and  Ethnic  Affairs   (1986-87).  Earlier in his career, Mr Richardson held various positions in the Department of Foreign  Affairs including in Nairobi, Port Moresby and Jakarta.    

 The relationship between Australia and the United States is deep and enduring.  It is a relationship  built on our shared values of freedom and democracy and closely aligned strategic interests.   

 Australia’s  long  standing  ANZUS  alliance  with  the  United  States  is  the  cornerstone  of  our   relationship.   Our  security  partnership  has  contributed  greatly  to  Australia’s  national  security  for   over 50 years including by improving the regional and global security environment.  Australia and  the United States are working together to build a free and democratic Iraq, have cooperated closely  in  fighting  the  scourge  of  terrorism  and  coordinated  closely  our  response  with  other  regional   partners to the tsunami disaster in South East Asia.   

 Australia and the United States have a vibrant and growing economic and trade relationship.  Two  way  investment  continues  to  strengthen.   The  United  States  is  Australia’s  second  largest  trading   partner  and  largest  single  source  of  direct  investment.   The  Australia-US  Free  Trade  Agreement   which came into force on 1 January 2005 has created new opportunities  for  significant  growth  in   our economies.   

 This is a dynamic relationship which will continue to diversify and develop.  Our shared strategic  and economic interests are all the stronger because of the political and social values and aspirations  our societies share.   

 Mr Richardson was born in Kempsey, NSW in 1947 and he holds a Bachelor of Arts with Honours  from Sydney University.  He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2003.  He is  married with a son and a daughter.
