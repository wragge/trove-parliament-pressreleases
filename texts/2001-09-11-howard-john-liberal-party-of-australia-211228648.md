 11 September 2001   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HOWARD  PRESS CONFERENCE, WASHINGTON D.C.   

 Subjects: Federal Court decision; Ansett   

 E&EO………………………………………………………………………………………   

 Can I just say, before I start on the domestic things, how horrified I am at what I’ve just  heard regarding what’s happened in New York.  I don’t know any more than anybody else  but it appears to be a most horrific, awful event that will obviously entail a very big loss of  life.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What was your action when you saw that [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Dreadful, just appalling, awful.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Will it effect the new leg of [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I don’t know.  It’s relatively unimportant compared with what’s at stake in something like  that.  I don’t know.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 But will you be reviewing that Embassy [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, it’s too early to say.  I’ve only just heard, you’ve only just heard, it’s only just  happened and obviously the authorities here will respond accordingly and I’ll let you know.

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you taking advice from the US Administration?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I’ll be doing whatever is the sensible thing, Glenn, but I just can’t tell you at this stage.   It’s only happened a quarter of an hour ago.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, what’s your response to the Court’s decision on the Tampa?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I’m very disappointed. We’ll appeal.  We believe very strongly that these are matters that  should be resolved by governments.  If the Labor Party and the Democrats had not blocked  the Border Protection Bill this matter would not have been before the courts in the first place.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Where does this leave the ship [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 The ship will continue on its voyage to Nauru.  That’s been indicated.  The terms of the order  are that the people are to be returned to the Australian mainland by 5.00pm on Friday,  Eastern Standard Time, unless an appeal is underway.  An appeal has been lodged.  I imagine  it will still be underway on Friday, so those words will operate in relation to it.  We intend to  prosecute the appeal with all the [inaudible] the law will allow.  We believe very strongly  that what the Government did was quite legal.  This is something that, in our view, is a matter  for elected governments to decide.  Our advice was that we were dealing with people who  were illegal aliens in Australian territorial water without permission.  It seemed a very  straightforward proposition.  The reason we put up the Border Protection Bill was for more  abundant caution.  The Labor Party and the Democrats voted that bill down.  We even  offered to put a termination date of six months on it and they’ve knocked that back.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, [inaudible] could you reintroduce the bill and render the Federal Court’s  decision [inaudible]   

 PM   

 Well, I’m not going to give running legal advice, I’m not going to do that.  Obviously we’re  looking at all the legal ramifications but one thing is clear, if the Border Protection Bill had  been passed this matter would not be in legal dispute but the Labor Party voted against that  Border Protection Bill.   

 JOURNALIST: 

  2

 

 [Inaudible] to consider the Bill again?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 We’re looking at all of our legal avenues.  Obviously the most immediate legal step for the  Government to take is to appeal against the decision of Mr Justice North.  We are doing that  and that appeal has already been lodged.  We have asked for an urgent hearing.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Is it still your determination that those people will not land on Australian soil?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Yes.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, [inaudible] the extra 200 people that were picked up after the initial Tampa,  were they also…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 They’re on the Manoora.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Will they be dropped off in Nauru?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, we have announced an arrangement with Nauru that will make that possible, yes.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 So everything will continue as normal until the appeal is exhausted…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, obviously we are bound by decisions of courts but we would hope that the appeal will  be disposed of quickly.  That’s a matter for the Court but clearly there’s a strong public  interest in it being dealt with quickly and we’ll just have to see what the outcome of that  appeal is.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What about the people who are going on to New Zealand, will they go on to New Zealand as  [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER: 

  3

 

 Well, they’re effected by the Court order.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 So they can’t keep on moving on to Nauru, is that what you’re saying?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, it depends on the timing, Jim, and that’s not in our hands.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] the appeal [inaudible] the processes that you’ve got underway will continue  unless you [inaudible]    

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Yes, yes.  But I would imagine that the court proceedings would have been resolved by then  but I can’t guarantee you that, that is a matter for the courts.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What’s the order to the Manoora right now?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 The Manoora is to continue to sail to Nauru.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, when you say you consider this a matter for a democratically elected  [inaudible] are you saying that the Federal Court has overstepped the mark?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No, I’m not going to say that.  I’m asserting what I think the role of government is.  I’m not  going to be drawn into a particular comment on the Court.  But this is a matter that relates to  the integrity of Australia’s borders and the integrity of our borders is surely a matter for the  democratically elected government, particularly when you are dealing with people who have  not come here by invitation, they have not established any refugee status, they are merely  presenting themselves without any right of entry.  And it has been our view, based on legal  advice, that we had a perfect sovereign right to prevent people without authorisation entering  the territorial waters of this country, which seemed to us to be a fairly fundamental sovereign  right of a democratic nation.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] your legal advice [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER: 

  4

 

 Well, that is a matter for the courts to decide, in the end the matter is still under appeal but I  am perfectly within my rights, while the matter is under appeal, to restate the basis of our  decision, which I’m doing.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, given that boat people seem to be still travelling to Australia [inaudible]    

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 We will continue to take all action we can within the law and within the bounds of civil  behaviour to prevent people who do not have a legal right to come to this country from  coming to this country, or our country.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 You’ve made that point about the sovereign right of the Parliament [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I don’t know.  I don’t know what position Mr Beazley takes on this.  It changes every day.  I  mean, he had a perfect right, an opportunity to support the Border Protection Bill, he’s now  talking and his shadow attorney general is scratching it out and talking about sitting down  and talking to us and putting amendments.  The time to do was when Parliament was sitting  and we had the Border Protection Bill.  He wouldn’t do that.  We even offered him six  months.  (inaudible) he was talking about then was impalpable of implementation because the  honeymoon arrangements had not been organised at the time the bill was before the  parliament. And he put the conditions (inaudible) placed upon the amendment he had by the  caucus made it impossible both of drafting and implementation because the haven  arrangements had not then put in place.  So it was an absolutely empty gesture.  The only  thing that he could have done if he was serious about helping us would have been to have  supported our bill with a sunset clause.  Okay, he thought it was too…it went too far.  I  offered him a six-month termination date which would have taken it through to the February  of next year.  So he knocked that back.  Now, I did this, I did that then because I wanted to be  certain that there was no legal doubt.  I had in contemplation the possibility that  notwithstanding the strength of our legal advice there might be some contrary view taken by  the courts.  Now, Mr Beazley had an opportunity then to back us.  He refused to do so.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 So are you no longer interested in talking to the Opposition?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well look, I don’t know what the Opposition’s position is, I really don’t.  I mean, it changes  every day.  I mean, he must exhaust himself running from one side of the road to the other.   

 JOURNALIST:

 Prime Minister, how long are you prepared to leave the people on board the Manoora while  the legal process [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, they can remain there for some time because…   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No, no there’s not.  I mean, it is limited by how long the courts take.  I mean, that’s not in my  hands.  I mean, the courts are independent, as they should be, of the Government and the  courts will decide - can I finish - the courts will decide how long this process takes.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Do you have any concerns for the wellbeing of these people?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I do and I hope other people have concern for their wellbeing as well.  They are very well  looked after.  This is a very well equipped troop ship.  It often stays at sea for weeks on end  with hundreds of troops.  It has plenty of facilities.  They are very comfortable and they are  being well looked after and there are plenty of medical facilities.  There are three operating  theatres.  We’re not dealing here with a situation where they can’t remain for a number of  days, of course they can - not ideal, there are a lot of things in the world that are not ideal but  it is not in my hands how long they remain at sea.  It is really in the hands of the courts.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, do you think that the court’s decision centres on making [inaudible] people  smugglers, that perhaps Australia is a soft touch?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I don’t want to, for reasons you will understand and will disappoint you, I’m not going  to sort of get into that element of specificity at this stage except to repeat that what we did  was on our advice and remains on our advice totally legal and something that I would have  thought, in the eyes of most Australians, was something that a democratically elected  government had the right to do.  We’re talking here about the right of a democratically  elected government to decide who comes to this country and to decide that if people present  themselves on the borders of this country without any legal permission to enter we have a  right to stop that occurring.  Now, I assert that absolutely and I believe that the Government  of this country has got this right, ought to have that right and I believe that most Australians  would agree with me.   

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible] judgement [inaudible] brought widespread community sentiment.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No, that’s something for you to say.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] have any bearing at all on the New York leg of your trip, this particular decision  by Justice North?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you ready to have an election based on this issue?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 You people keep raising the issue of an election.  There’ll be an election soon anyway before  the end of the year, nothing’s altered on that.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What’s your view of the motivation of those who [inaudible] this case…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 You need to talk to them.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] timing before the Manoora is due to arrive in Nauru.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Oh, it’s some days yet.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, what was the [inaudible] Papua New Guinea, was it a decision to keep the  ship going until this whole procedure was out of the way or...   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 We just see it’s easier to do it that way, yes.   

 JOURNALIST:   

  7

 [Inaudible] have any urgency of the situation, do you think of the sensible [inaudible] of the  appeal to have [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, Jim, we’re giving a lot of thought to a lot of things and not everything we’re giving  thought to we talk about but the time, right [inaudible] time for legislation on this was when  Parliament was last sitting.   

 J 

 

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, you asked me the question, I’ll give you my answer.  The ideal time was then.  The  Labor Party and the Democrats had an opportunity to put this beyond legal argument.  They  passed up that opportunity.  If they had passed that Border Protection Bill this issue would  not have been before the courts.  It’s the Labor Party and the Democrats voted it down and  because they voted it down they took away our capacity to remove any legal doubt.  I think  they failed the national interest in doing that, failed it very badly indeed.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]…you mentioned several times the matter of legal advice, if that legal advice has  not been released would you be prepared to…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No, well why would you release your legal advice in the middle of court proceedings.  I  mean, the Commonwealth [inaudible] done that favour by its opponents.  I mean, to ask the  Commonwealth in the middle of legal proceedings to release its legal advice, come on Tony.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, when you say you’re considering a range of options…[inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Look, I’m not going into what the details are.  In a situation like this you look at a whole  range of options but our prime goal is to win the appeal.  I’m told we should win the appeal  but I don’t know, that’s a matter for the courts.  But I have to say that this matter would not  be before the courts if the Border Protection Bill had been passed.  It was the Labor Party and  the Democrats that voted that Border Protection Bill down.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you receiving any further information in relation to the Ansett situation?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

  8

  9

 No.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 On that Ansett issue, there is a degree of hindsight that the Government perhaps should have  acted earlier to have [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 But you’re dealing here with a privately owned company.  We’ve reached a stage now where  the Government’s responsible for the commercial fortunes of every privately owned  company.  The foreign investment decision on this matter was not a foreign investment  decision to the Australian Government, it was a foreign investment decision for the New  Zealand Government.  I don’t know how anybody can say the Australian Government should  have done this or that.  Ansett is a private company, a very large private company and its  financial position, whatever it may be, is a consequence of commercial decisions it has taken,  its management and Air New Zealand, which has been its owner now for some time, have  taken.  It’s not the responsibility of the Australian Government, we don’t own it.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you happy with the [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Of course I’m happy with the way he’s handled the matter, of course I am.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 But you concede that there’ll have to be job losses whatever…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Look, I’m not going to concede anything while the thing is moving.  Okay.   

 [Ends]
