 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. The Hon. Ian Macphee "33

 30 April 1981

 REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS -

 Commenting on the findings of the Review of Commonwealth  Functions, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ian Macphee said: "The Prime Minister has announced that assisted passages for non-refugee migrants will be 

 terminated as from today.

 As from today assisted passages will be provided only to:

 .  people who lodged their applications for migration ·   before 1 May 1981 and who meet current criteria for  assisted passages;

 .  eligible migrants on whose behalf employment nominations  were lodged prior to 1 May 1981.

 These migrants will be eligible for assisted passages  provided they arrive in Australia before 30 June 1982. They  will be eligible for Government-subsidised accommodation  on arrival.

 Refugees will continue to receive full passage assistance  where no other source of assistance is available. Those  refugees with available assets above $20,000, in the case  of families, and $10,000, in the case of individuals, will 

 be required to meet the cost of their travel to Australia.

 Australia has migration agreements with six countries which  provide for assisted passages. Consultations will be  sought with the Governments concerned. ,

 People lodging applications to migrate to Australia on or  after 1 May 1981, though ineligible for passage assistance,  may be entitled to accommodation at migrant centres,  provided the occupation of the principal applicant is in 

 shortage or in minor shortage in Australia. Details of  these accommodation arrangements will be announced as  soon as they are finalised.

 At present there is an increasing number of applications  for migration to Australia in many countries overseas. The applicants include people with skills needed in  Australia. Many migrants now prefer to make their own  way to Australia. They can obtain cheap fares enabling 

 them to stop over in various places en route to Australia. It is expected that competition between airlines will  enable migrants and employers nominating migrants to

 obtain acceptable fares for travel to Australia.

 The Government will continue to seek migrants with  occupations in shortage in Australia by publicity and recruit­ ment activities overseas and by promoting the employment  nomination scheme in Australia.

 The Telephone Interpreter Service provides an essential  service primarily for emergency situations and an information  service. Most calls are in normal weekday working hours.

 Experience has shown that staffing does not need to be  duplicated in each centre, of migrant population.

 With use of the telephone diversion equipment, local calls  can be automatically transferred anywhere in Australia at  the cost of a local call to the caller and with efficient  service to clients. In this way the Telephone Interpreter  Service has been extended well beyond what the Galbally  Report recommended. .

 Further use of diversion equipment is intended.  This will  avoid the cost of continuously operating the Telephone  Interpreter Service by office-based staff at times when  there are very few calls. '

 Under the new system there will be 10 hours of fully-  staffed operation from Monday to Friday.  Calls made  outside those core hours will be automatically  switched to interpreters on stand-by.

 The substantial cost of maintaining fully-staffed services  in less populous States will be avoided by diverting calls  to larger services interstate where interpreters are more 

 readily available and clients will have access to a greater  range of languages..  -  ·

 On-the-spot interpretation by contract interpreters will  continue to be provided where necessary.  .  Guidelines will  define where this service will be provided.

 There will be no reduction in the effectiveness of the  service by reducing the number of hours operated by office-  based staff or diverting calls interstate to larger services.   The aim is to achieve greater economies by using new 

 technology without any reduction in the effectiveness  of the service.  The new arrangements will be phased in  to ensure that the effectiveness of. the service is not  reduced.

 Translating services are currently provided by the  Commonwealth, some State Governments and the private  sector.

 The Commonwealth has encouraged State Governments to  provide these services by funding of cost-sharing

 arrangements. These will be continued and extended. Those State (Jovernments not yet participating will be  given the opportunity of doing so.

 In future the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs will concentrate on providing translation facilities within areas of direct Commonwealth responsibility, focussing particularly on programs designed to -  facilitate

 the initial settlement of migrants. .

 Basic Commonwealth translation services will still be  required where other Departments,  State authorities and  organisations, or the private sector, for various reasons,  are not able to provide these effectively.

 The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will  recover the costs of translation work done on behalf of  Commonwealth and State authorities and for private firms  and organisations.

 The private sector will be encouraged to play an increasing  role in providing translations to firms, organisations  and individuals.

 The Government established the National Acerediation  Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATl) to  ensure that proper standards 'of interpreting and translating  are set and maintained and to test and accredit people .   who meet these standards.

 The Authority has been active in testing and  accrediting interpreters and translators. A pool  of qualified persons is being developed throughout  Australia and is expanding. This is a big task  because more than 100 languages and dialects are in .

 common use.  .

 Recently it was announced that NAATl will also develop  standards, testing and accreditation.procedures in . Aboriginal languages.

 It is proposed to work towards the development of a self­ funding, self-regulatory and representative body in the  interpreting and translating profession itself, which  eventually will take over from NAATl the role of  accrediting interpreters and translators in accordance  with the standards it has set.

 A new advisory body, the Australian Population Advisory  Council, has been set up to advise the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs.

 Previously there were three advisory bodies:

 .  the Australian Population and Immigration Council

 .  The Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, and â

 .  . .  / 4

 &

 .  the Australian Refugee Advisory Council.

 They have provided a foundation of constructive, informed  advice which will be available to the new Council.

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs also  receives advice from the Australian Institute of Multi­ cultural Affairs.  The Minister will continue to consult  with a wide range of ethnic and community organisations 

 on matters within his responsibility. The current  NUMAS forum provides an example of this.

 The Australian Population Advisory Council will concentrate  resources in providing advice on the major policy aspects  of the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio with '   emphasis on:

 .  population and immigration policies 

 .  refugee matters 

 .  citizenship

 .  control over entry to Australia, and

 .  post-arrival services to migrants related to the  immigration function.

 The Council will complement the work of the Australian  Institute of Multicultural Affairs. .

 The membership of the Council will include prominent  people from business,  industry, trade unions, ethnic  communities and voluntary services, together with academic 

 experts in disciplines.closely related to the functions  of the portfolio.

 A Population Branch has been created within the Department  of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide an identifiable  body to focus Commonwealth activity in population matters.  The Branch will monitor and analyse the implications for  Australia of population changes,  both in Australia and 

 overseas,  and strengthen the ability of the Government to  respond positively to these changes.

 Publication of a directory providing details of ethnic  organisations throughout Australia will cease. A revision  to be published in the near future will be the last to be  issued by the Commonwealth.

 . .  . /5

 Several State Governments are now publishing comprehensive  directories and for the Commonwealth to continue to publish  a more general directory would result in needless 

 duplication. ·

 Where possible the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs will contract out the conduct of 1  field1  activity  within the Adult Migrant Education Program to State and  non-Government bodies.

 This is consistent with the present close working arrange­ ments with the State Adult. Migrant Education Services which  conduct most of the activities within the program.

 A further outcome of the Review of Commonwealth Functions  is that the Department of Social Security will take over  responsibility for physical payment of Education Living  Allowances to migrant and refugees attending full-time  English language courses.  This new arrangement will reduce  problems of transition between Social Security Benefits  and Education Living Allowances and provide a better  service for adult migrant and refugee students. .

 The Government has decided that charges should be made  where appropriate for the services of the Committee on  Overseas Professional Qualifications. No charges have  been levied in the past for straight qualification 

 assessments.

 The Government embraces the principle of 'fee for  service'  and considers this should be extended to other  COPQ activities.

 An interdepartmental task group will review the role of  the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in  providing information services. The task group will  comprise representatives of the Departments of Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs,  Finance,  the Public Service Board and  the Australian Information Service.

 Economies will be made by ceasing production of two weekly  bulletins,  For the Ethnic Media and From the Ethnic Press  and of a monthly compilation o f DIEA news releases;  Information contained in these publications will continue 

 to be available in either AGPS publication Commonwealth  Record or in a compendium of material translated from the  ethnic press which the Foreign Language Newspapers  Association intends to produce.
