  CALL FOR CONSCIENCE VOTE ON 

  CHILDREN IN DETENTION 

  Thirteen months after the last boat of asylum seekers arrived on our shores, more than   90 children remain incarcerated behind razor wire in maximum security immigration   detention camps in Woomera, Curtin, Pt Hedland, Baxter, Maribyrnong and Villawood,   according to the latest figures collected from the camps. 

  Figures released today by A Just Australia, a national umbrella group working for better   treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, show that in mid-September there were still   52 boys and 42 girls living in detention in these camps. 229 more kids are on Manus   Island and Nauru. Many have now been incarcerated for more than 12 months, with 

  some having been locked up for close to three years. 

  Dr John Yu, one of the patrons of A Just Australia, today called for urgent debate on an   amendment to a Migration Bill, that if passed would prohibit maximum-security   detention of children. He also called for a conscience vote on the legislation. 

  “The Parliamentary debate on embryos and stem cell research showed the nation’s   concern about life, and the need for research to improve life,” Dr Yu said. 

  “Yet the real human tragedy of what we are doing to living children is being ignored. 

  “Parliament must urgently discuss this matter and prohibit holding children in   maximum security facilities, and to require unaccompanied children to be placed in   foster or protective care. 

  “Surely the unintended suffering of children who have done nothing wrong, other than   being born in detention camps or being brought to this country by their families,   deserves the urgent consideration of Parliament. 

  “The debate must be based on justice for these children, and our duty of care to them   while they are in Australia, irrespective of the ultimate findings of their refugee status.   It is a debate that should be solely dictated by conscience,” Dr Yu said. 

  Dr Yu, a former Australian of the Year, is one of Australia’s most distinguished and   highly regarded community leaders. He and the national director of A Just Australia,   Howard Glenn, will be in Canberra on Thursday (26 September), to encourage   members of Parliament to address the issue of children in detention.
