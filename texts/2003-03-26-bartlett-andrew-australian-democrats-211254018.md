     Citizens of Australia call for an “Act of Grace”  

 

 The Australian Democrats today accepted thousands of petitions seeking an “Act of Grace” from  the Australian Government.  

 Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the initiative by a coalition of  social justice groups including the National Council of Churches in Australia and the Uniting  Church of Australia, was an effective way to appeal to the Government to recognize the  humanitarian disaster their policies on asylum seekers and refugees have created.  

 “This is a wonderful opportunity for the Government to address the impact of their policies,”  Senator Bartlett said. 

 “The petitions are calling for an end to two of the most destructive practices the Government has  ever undertaken when dealing with asylum seekers and refugees - mandatory detention and  temporary protection visas. 

 “Thousands of asylum seekers have been detained in remote locations and many remain there  indefinitely. 

 “The tragedy is that we have reached the situation where people are literally being driven mad by  the extended detention,” Senator Bartlett said. 

 Senator Bartlett said there were currently about 8,000 refugees living in limbo in Australia on  Temporary Protection Visas. 

 “These visas have left families in the ridiculous situation of enjoying Australia’s protection for  different periods of time. Parents and children have different visas which could see them deported  months and years apart from each other,” Senator Bartlett said. 

 “The amounts of stress people are facing are incredible and the cost to Australia in lost  opportunities is immense.”  

 Senator Bartlett said the thousands of petitions collected in just ten days highlighted the level of  distress among Australians regarding the injustice suffered by those who most need our help.
