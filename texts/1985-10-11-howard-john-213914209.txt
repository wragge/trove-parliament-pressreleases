 St a l i n ' s forced f a m i n e i n the Uk r a i n e j u s t over f i f t y

 YEARS AGO WAS ONE OF THE MOST BARBARIC ACTS OF HUMAN 

 HISTORY.

 I n terms of l i v e s l o s t, i t ranks w i t h Hi t l e r ' s war

 AGAINST THE JEWS ON ANY MEASURE OF HUMAN E V I L ,

 I n r e c en t y e a r s t h e r e has been an i n c r e a s i n g  aw areness

 OF THE SIX MILLION WHO DIED IN THE NAZI HOLOCAUST.

 It i s i m p o r t a n t t h a t t h e i r f a t e i s ne ve r fo r go tte n and

 THAT MANKIND IS CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF H IT LE R 'S  RACIST 

 GENOCIDE.

 It i s a m a t t e r of de e p re gre t t h a t so l i t t l e  IS KNOWN 

 i n the We s t a bo ut St a l i n ' s b r u t a l war a g a i n s t  t he Uk r a i n e 

 BETWEEN 1 9 2 8  AND 1 9 3 3  THAT DIRECTLY LED TO THE DEATHS 

 OF BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN MILLION INNOCENT C IV ILIA N S  -  

 INCLUDING ABOUT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN.

 There were f o r e ig n  correspondents  i n St a l i n ' s USSR who

 KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT WHO FAILED TO REPORT IT .

 Ot h e r s , however , such as Malc olm  Mug g eridg e  and Wi l l i a m  

 Henry Ch a m b e r l a i n , reported  t r u t h f u l l y  and courageously

 WHAT THEY HAD SEEN. TRAGICALLY, THEY WERE NOT WIDELY BELIEVED.

 Hi t l e r ' s Na z i s  and St a l i n ' s Com m unis ts  were the most

 BRUTAL TOTALITARIAN REGIMES THE WORLD HAS KNOWN.

 I t should  be remembered  t h a t World War Two -  the worst

 CONFLAGRATION IN HISTORY THAT TOOK ALMOST 60 MILLION 

 LIVES -  ONLY COMMENCED AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE N A Z I-So v i e t  Pa c t under w h i c h , between  1939 and 1941, Hi t l e r  

 and St a l i n  d i v i d e d  up Eastern  Europe between  t h e m s e l v e s .

 I t i s A GREAT HONOUR TO UNVEIL AND OFFICIALLY DEDICATE

 the f i r s t  Al l Au s t r a l i a n  Monument  to the memory of the

 VICTIMS OF THE FORCED FAMINE IN THE UKRAINE,

 Of course  the Uk r a i n i a n s  were not the only v i c t i m s  of 

 St a l i n ' s c o l l e c t i v i s a t i o n , d e p o r t a t io n s  and forced

 FAMINE -  MILLIONS OF OTHERS ALSO DIED IN THE NORTH

 Caucasus  and Ce ntra l  Volga r e g io n s  as well as i n parts 

 of So v i e t  As i a . And the Ru s s i a n s  t h e m s e lv e s  were v i c t i m s

 OF THE MARXIST-LENINIST DICTATORSHIP OF THE DAY.

 But the f a m in e  was most i n t e n s e  in the Uk r a i n e . And

 THE CAUSE FOR IT WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE POLICIES OF THE 

 LEADERSHIP OF THE SOVIET COMMUNIST PARTY.

 As the Br i t i s h  w r it e r  Robert Conquest  has w r i t t e n :

 " T he f a m in e  can be blamed  q u i t e  f l a t l y  on St a l i n  . . .

 I t i s perhaps  the only case i n h i s t o r y  of a purely

 . MAN-MADE FAMINE. IT IS ALSO THE ONLY MAJOR FAMINE

 WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE WAS IGNORED OR DENIED BY THE 

 GOVERNMENT AND EVEN TO A LARGE DEGREE SUCCESSFULLY 

 CONCEALED FROM WORLD OPINION. THERE SEEMS LITTLE 

 DOUBT THAT THE MAIN ISSUE WAS SIMPLY CRUSHING THE i

 PEASANTRY AT ANY C O S T . "

 O r  a s  a  R u s s i a n  p o e t  ( who  was  i n  t i m e  t o  b e c o m e  a  v i c t i m  

 of  S t a l i n ' s  p u r g e s ) w r o t e :

 " T en  p a c e s  awa y  a n d  our  v o i c e s  c a n n o t  be  h e a r d  

 x T he  o n l y  one  h e a r d  i s  t h e  K r e m l i n  m o u n t a i n e e r  

 T he  d e s t r o y e r  of  l i f e  a n d  s l a y e r  of  p e a s a n t s . "

 ( Q u o t e  from  A dam  U l a m ' s  i n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  M i r o n  

 D o l o t ' s  E x e c u t i o n  by  H u n g e r , N o r t o n , N ew  Y o r k , 1 9 8 5 )

 St a l i n ' s f a m in e  was more than a war on the p e a s a n t r y .

 I t als o in v o l v e d  a t y p i c a l  t o t a l i t a r i a n  t y p e l i q u i d a t i o n  ‘

 OF THE CULTURAL, RELIGIOUS AND INTELLECTUAL ELITE OF THE

 Uk r a i n i a n  l e a d e r s h i p . As such i t  i n v o l v e d  an e le m e n t  of

 CULTURAL GENOCIDE.

 The s u r v iv o r s  and descendants  of the v i c t i m s  of the Na z i 

 Holocaus t  and of St a l i n ' s mass k i l l i n g s  have every r i g h t

 TO ERECT MONUMENTS TO THE VICTIMS,

 Such m e m o r ia l s  serve as a t i m e l y  r e m in d e r  of the fate

 THAT INVARIABLY BEFALLS THOSE WHO BECOME THE VICTIMS 

 OF TOTALITARIAN OPPRESSION. , 1

 Those who suggest  t h a t peace a t any p r i c e  i s a v i a b l e  o p t io n  

 would do well to r e a l i s e  t h a t a conquerin g  aggressor  i n v a r i a b l y

 BRINGS ABOUT ONLY THE PEACE OF THE GRAVE OR THE GULAG,

 Al l of us should  be s y m p a t h e t ic  to the g e n u in e  and s in c e r e

 PEACE MAKER. THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE,

 But i n our quest  for peace and m u l t i l a t e r a l  d i s a r m a m e n t ,

 WE MUST NOT TAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL UNINTENTIONALLY 

 ENCOURAGE AN AGGRESSOR OR A POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR. .

 At a ceremony  such as t h i s  i t  IS a p p r o p r i a t e  to record

 THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN MOSCOW STILL DENIES BASIC FREEDOMS 

 TO ITS OWN POPULATION -  BOTH RUSSIAN AND NON-RUSSIAN,

 Moreover  the USSR has never p u b l i c l y  a ton ed  for St a l i n ' s

 CRIMES -  INCLUDING THE DELIBERATE UKRAINIAN FAMINE.

 On any a n a l y s i s , the So v i e t  Un io n i s an e x p a n s io n a r y

 WORLD POWER.

 I n the ten years  s i n c e  the f a l l  of Sa i g o n , pro- So v i e t

 FORCES HAVE COME TO POWER IN LAOS, CAMBODIA, MOZAMBIQUE,

 An g o l a , South Ye m e n, Ni c a r a g u a , Af g h a n i s t a n  and Et h i o p i a  -

 PARTS OF WHICH, UNDER MARXIST RULE, HAVE ALSO HAD A FORCED 

 FAMINE. ,

 I n Af g h a n i s t a n , 1 0 0 ,0 0 0  So v i e t  troops  are l i t e r a l l y

 PUTTING THE LOCAL POPULATION TO THE SWORD BY CONDUCTING 

 A WAR OF STAGGERING BRUTALITY AND OPPRESSION.

 Acc ording  to r e p o r t s , Af g h a n is t a n  has lo s t alm ost  a quarter

 OF ITS POPULATION (THROUGH DEATH OR REFUGEE OUTFLOW) SINCE

 the So v i e t  i n v a s i o n . There has been w id e s p r e a d  p o l i t i c a l

 AND CULTURAL REPRESSION. POLITICAL PRISONERS ARE TORTURED.

 War has been waged on c i v i l i a n  s e t t l e m e n t s .

 And y et t h i s  war of a g g r e s s io n  fe a tu r e s  l i t t l e  in our news

 OR ON OUR TV SCREENS.

 The Afghan p e r s e c u t i o n , l i k e  the Uk r a i n i a n  f a m i n e , i s

 VERY MUCH THE PRODUCT OF A CLOSED SOCIETY, THERE IS 

 LITTLE MEDIA COMMENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO FREE PRESS.

 Closer to home there i s l i t t l e  coverage  of the o p p r e s s i v e

 PRACTICES OF THE REGIMES IN VIETNAM, CAMBODIA AND LAOS.

 But we do know t h a t Moscow has engaged  i n what can only

 BE DESCRIBED AS A SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY BUILD UP IN THE

 Pa c i f i c  and I n d ia n  Oceans and the South Ch i n a  Se a .

 Under the terms of t h e Treaty  of Fr i e n d s h i p  between  

 Moscow and Ha n o i , the So v i e t  Un io n has access  to 

 the Vie t n a m e s e  m i l i t a r y  bases  at Da Nang and Cam Ranh 

 Bay , ‘

 Cam Ranh Bay i s now the la r g e s t  So v i e t  n aval  base o u t s i d e  

 of the Warsaw Pa ct c o u n t r i e s ,

 I n other words, the So v i e t  Un io n i s r a p i d l y  beco m ing

 THE PREPONDERANT MILITARY POWER IN OUR REGION.

 I t i s t i m e l y  to record t h e s e  u n p l e a s a n t  facts  on a day

 ON WHICH WE REMEMBER THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF STALIN'S

 war on the Uk r a i n e  of f i f t y  years a g o.

 I CONGRATULATE those who i n i t i a t e d , and those who 

 SUPPORTED, THE CpNSTRUCTION OF THIS ALL-AUSTRALIAN

 Monument  to the v i c t i m s  of the forced f a m in e  i n the 

 Uk r a i n e .
