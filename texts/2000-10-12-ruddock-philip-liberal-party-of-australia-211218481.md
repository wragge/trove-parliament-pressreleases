 Minister Launches Booklet on Australia's Refugee Programs MPS 103/2000

 A publication on Australia's international refugee programs launched today by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock demonstrates Australia's generous and ongoing commitment to resolving refugee problems the world over.

 "Recent debate in Australia has focused almost solely on asylum seekers arriving on our shores, but the booklet Refugee and Humanitarian Issues -Australia's Response places Australia's response to this issue in a wider global context," Mr Ruddock said.

 "It sets out Australia's extensive and generous activity in support of international efforts to find solutions for refugees in vulnerable positions around the world.

 "Through our offshore resettlement programs, financial contributions to international organisations and international diplomatic activity, Australia makes a very significant contribution to the resolution of refugee problems.

 "We rank third in the world in terms of the absolute number of refugees resettled annually and second when resettlement is examined on a per capita basis. We are also playing a central leadership role on international policy regarding asylum seekers," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister reaffirmed that the Government remains committed to finding long term solutions to global refugee problems.

 "We are prepared to invest directly in this, but at the same time we are determined not to allow the activities of people smugglers to undermine public

 support for these efforts," Mr Ruddock said.

 "It is important to ensure our focus remains on those refugees for whom resettlement is the only viable option and that our priorities are not set by the people smugglers," he said.

 The booklet was launched as part of national celebrations of Refugee Week. Refugee Week which runs 7 to 15 October, is celebrated each year to raise public awareness of the plight of the estimated 22.3 million refugees worldwide.

 Copies of the booklet can be obtained from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
