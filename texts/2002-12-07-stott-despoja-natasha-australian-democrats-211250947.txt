 SNAP SHOT OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS 2002 The Australian Democrats’ Youth Poll 2002 has found that the majority of young people do not support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.

 In its 11th year, Youth Poll provides an insight into how Australia’s 15 to 20 year-olds feel about themselves, their place in society, their approach to life and national issues.

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, releasing the Poll today in Adelaide, said young Australians are keenly aware of the issues confronting them in the broader community and issues facing Australia as a nation.

 Disturbingly, Youth Poll showed that a majority of young people know a young person who has attempted or committed suicide (53%).

 It found that the majority of young Australians support Australia becoming a republic; 65% of young people want condom vending machines in schools; and almost 90% want publicly funded education.

 88% of respondents believe the Government is not doing enough to protect our environment.

 Also an increasing number of Australia’s young are trying drugs.  44% of respondents have tried marijuana - up from 38% in last year’s Poll - with a significant minority (15%) having tried amphetamines or hallucinogens such as ecstasy, LSD or speed.  This is an increase from last year (12%).

 Youth Poll found 80% of young people believe gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people should be given the same legal protection as heterosexuals.

 Surprisingly, 14% of this year’s respondents trusted politicians as a source of political information, compared to just 3% last year and in previous Youth Polls.

 Another surprise was the significant decrease in the number of young people who trust the media as a source of information about politics.  This year’s result puts the media in last place as a source of information for the first time in the history of Youth Poll - a position that has previously been held by politicians.

 The Poll also asked young people questions specifically relating to their state of residence, ranging from should nuclear waste be dumped in SA, should the ACT have its own prison, is the Qld Government doing enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef?

 “While young people often feel frustrated at a perceived inability to have a significant impact on the decisions that affect them, the views expressed by them reveal an informed and articulate generation with a genuine agenda for positive change,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 Youth Poll is circulated to all universities, TAFEs, many schools and youth organisations.  It is also available from community groups. More than 2000 young people took part in this national survey from every State and Territory.
