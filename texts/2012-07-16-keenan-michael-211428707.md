 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling SMUGGLERS HAVE GILLARD  GOVERNMENT AT END OF A STRING AS  MORE July 11, 2012

 More than 150 people have turned up on three boats in the last 24 hours, with the Australian Navy coâopted to complete  the journey for passengers on two of these vessels, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said. 

 "Labor’s  border  protection  crisis  has  entered  a  new  phase  with  Australian  naval  and  customs  vessels  now  effectively being coâopted by people smugglers to deliver their passengers for them to Christmas Island. This is not why Australians joined the Navy," Mr Morrison said. 

 "The people smugglers have always had the Gillard  Government at the end of a string and are continuing, bolder than ever, to call the shots on who gets to come to Australia. 

 "Despite  distress  calls  being  made  by  vessels  within  the  Indonesian  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR)  zone  and  under  the coordination of Indonesian authorities, passengers are now being ferried directly to Christmas Island. 

 "Guidelines on the Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea1 published by the International Maritime Organisation state - ‘the government responsible for the SAR region in which survivors were recovered is responsible for providing a place of safety  or  ensuring  that  such  a  place  of  safety  is  provided’  (para.  2.5).  Similarly,  amendments  to  the  SOLAS  and  SAR   Conventions  require  signatories  to  ‘coâordinate  and  coâoperate  to  ensure  that  masters  of  ships  providing  assistance arrange disembarkation as soon as reasonably practicable’.2 

 "Since the Government’s bungling of the Oceanic Viking crisis with Indonesia in 2009, and their characteristic mega phone diplomacy,  the  opportunity  to  engage  Indonesia  on  these  issues  has  been  significantly  damaged.  It  is  no  longer  even considered  an  option  by  the  Australian  Government  to  take  rescued  asylum  seekers  on  smugglers  boats,  in  the Indonesian SAR zone by Australian ships, back to Indonesia.

 "After the last major tragedy the Coalition called on the Government to hold urgent bilateral discussions with Indonesia to clarify  expectations  of  our  respective  responses  to  incidents  within  Indonesia's  searchâandârescue  zone  and  whether  protocols need to be refreshed. We stated that such protocols should include when assets should and will be deployed for interception or assistance  and  where people would be  taken. These  discussions could  also  canvass whether additional resources are required by Indonesian authorities to support these arrangements. 

 "While some progress was made on this issue at the margin, the destination of all those rescued at sea, no matter how close to Indonesia is still Australia. 

 "Labor’s inaction on our borders is seeing boats come at a rate of almost one a day, with people smugglers getting even bolder while Australia languishes under a Prime Minister who refuses to act. 

 "Just  11  days  into  July  and  already  more  than  450  people  have  arrived,  the  number  the  government  budgeted  would arrive  every  month  this  year  when  it  handed  down  their  budget,  meaning  more  blowouts  are  on  the  way,"  Mr  Morrison said. 

 Mr  Keenan  said:  "Our  men  and  women  of  Border  Protection  Command  have  been  run  ragged  in  the  past  24  hours, ferrying three illegal boats to Christmas Island overnight - Labor’s border protection crisis is forcing them to work at all  hours escorting illegal boats from Indonesian waters to Australia. 

 "The crew of HMAS Childers and the ACV Triton deserve medals for being forced to work at this breakneck speed, acting as an escort for these boats, collecting a total of 157 people on three illegal vessels last night. 

 "In the first three years after the Howard government implemented the suite of measures there was only one boat - now  we  have  348  boats  with  20,377  people  and  a  multiâbillion  dollar  blow  out  that  has  been  picked  up  by  the  Australian taxpayer. 

 "The Gillard Labor Government need to put a stop to this chaos at our borders by implementing our sound border  protection policies or ensure that our men and women of Border Protection Command are adequately resourced to deal

 with this constant flow of illegal arrivals, it is simply unsustainable at this rate," Mr Keenan said.
