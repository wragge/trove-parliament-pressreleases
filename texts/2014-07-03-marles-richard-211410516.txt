 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Scott Morrison goes to ground on status of reported asylum seekers   

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has  slammed the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison for refusing to front the  Australian public and provide an update on the status of two reported asylum  seeker vessels near Christmas Island.   

 Scott Morrison has gone into hiding, refusing to front the media and explain to  the Australian people what exactly is taking place on our seas.   

 The Immigration Minister must explain to Australians what the status of the  people on the reported vessels are, including women and children and what  steps have been taken to safeguard their wellbeing.   

 He must also explain what support our Navy and Customs personnel are  providing to these reported vessels.   

 Citing operational reasons as a way to avoid scrutiny is a farce.   

 The appropriate mechanism for processing those who arrive by sea is the  Regional Resettlement Arrangement, which Labor put in place on July 19 last  year.
