 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Welfare and Community Housing

 Press Release Dated: 18 Oct 2000

 Press Release Number: 00/650 Portfolio: Welfare and Community Housing 

 Homelessness buck passing: Democrats call for GST bucks to be passed on Homelessness should not become a political football between the Federal and Queensland governments, according to the Australian Democrats.

 Queensland Senator and Democrats’ housing spokesperson, Andrew Bartlett, said the Queensland Government has highlighted shortfalls in both Aboriginal housing and accommodation for refugees and should allocate the money from Queensland’s GST windfall to maintain and expand public housing, rather than just blaming the Federal Government.

 “The Queensland Government has provided some additional funds for Aboriginal housing, however the situation for refugees released from detention is dire and the load is falling on the churches and welfare groups,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Queensland Housing Minister, Mr Schwarten, is blaming Federal Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman for the situation of these new refugees, when it is really a result of the policies of the Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock.

 “Helping refugees with accommodation and other services would be an investment in the long run. History shows us that migrants and refugees in particular give a lot back to their communities once they are established.

 “Homelessness must not become a political football between the Federal and Queensland governments, the way the issue of land clearing has,” Senator Bartlett said.

 Senator Bartlett expressed concern at the Queensland Government’s plans to sell off housing services.

 “The windfall from the GST should allow the Queensland Government to maintain and expand public housing.”

 Queensland signed the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA) in July 1999 which brings the state $780 million over four years and commits the state to increasing its public dwellings and

 community housing stock by around 90 thousand dwellings in 1999-2000.

 “The Democrats gained extra money from the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) as part of the GST agreement with the Government, but there has always been no doubt that further funding was needed,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The Democrats believe SAAP spending is about 25% short of meeting current demand.”

 The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates there are over 100,000 homeless Australians. An Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report released in April estimated that more than 116,000 homeless people were turned away from crisis shelters each year due to a lack of emergency accommodation.
