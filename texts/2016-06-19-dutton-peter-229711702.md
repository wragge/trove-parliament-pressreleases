 RECOGNISING REFUGEE WEEK 

 

 Refugee Week 2016 will be celebrated from 19 to 25 June, coinciding with World Refugee Day  on 20 June.   

 During Refugee Week Australia will celebrate its long and proud tradition of resettling refugees  and people in humanitarian need.    

 Since the end of World War II, Australia has resettled more than 840,000 refugees.      

 The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton said that refugee week  provides an important reminder of the role that Australia has played in resettling some of the  world’s most vulnerable people.    

 “Australia consistently ranks in the top three resettlement countries each year, along with the  United States and Canada, which collectively provide more than 80 per cent of global  resettlement places,” Mr Dutton said.    

 “Australia’s humanitarian programme takes in some of the most vulnerable people, whether it’s  from conflicts in the Middle-East, sub-Saharan Africa and those displaced within our region.   

 “Evidence shows that some of these people will face challenges requiring ongoing support long  after their arrival in Australia.   

 “The Turnbull Government will ensure that we will continue to provide our world class pre and  post arrival programmes to ensure that refugees are supported to settle into Australia and  realise their full potential.”    

 Australia’s 2016-17 Humanitarian Programme comprising 13,750 places will increase to 18,750  places in 2018-19.    

 In addition, Australia is in the process of settling the additional 12,000 people displaced by  conflicts in Iraq and Syria.
