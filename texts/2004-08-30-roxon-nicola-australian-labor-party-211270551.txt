 National Community Legal Centres Conference 

 

 Speech 

 Transcript          30  August  2004  

 Check Against Delivery   Acknowledgements  

 â¢ Liz O'Brien, the National Convener & Julie Bishop  

 â¢ All conference organisers, always a big task to get everyone together and organised.   

 â¢ I'd also like to acknowledge all of you who work so hard for the community in your legal centres.    Having been a very ineffective volunteer at North Melbourne in my early days as a lawyer, I know it  can be pretty hard work - you handle difficult legal issues, hard to make ends meet and there is  constantly unmet demand. So, thank you for the work you do.  

 When I agreed to speak to this conference no-one was sure whether the election would be on or not.  As it  turns out we are in day 2 of a hotly contested election and I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk to  you all about a range of issues in the Attorney's portfolio.   

 I want to talk today about Labor's positive agenda and leave you with a sense of optimism that we don't  need to abandon the rule of law or a commitment to social justice in order to tackle the many difficult  international and domestic legal issues facing us as a nation today.  

 

 New Department of Homeland Security  

 Firstly, though, a structural difference between us and the Government.   

 In light of the increasing importance of national security, Labor has committed to establishing a new  department and a Minister for Homeland Security.  This new department will bring together management of  our borders, protection of our ports and airports, ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and other relevant  agencies.  This new Homeland Security portfolio will have a greater co-ordinating role with the Departments  of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General.  

 But just as importantly, what this change recognises is that a Labor Attorney will not have all their time and  attention dedicated to security issues.  Labor's strong and focussed handling of security matters will not  come at the expense of attention of all other domestic legal matters.   

 This strategic division of portfolio responsibilities not only leaves us better placed to deal with security  matters, but leaves me free to look at broader justice issues, the proper administration of the courts, human  rights matters, constitutional law, international law and the whole range of civil matters from family law to   bankruptcy.  

 In my case, you can also add to this a number of modern democracy issues like our commitment to Australia  becoming a republic and the reform of our Freedom of Information Act.    

 Funding - contracting out - legal aid  

 But before I get into some of our policy priorities I want to talk first about expenditure in the legal areas.  

 Back in 1996 the Commonwealth contribution to Legal Aid was just over $128m per annum.  As you are all  aware, this was dramatically cut by nearly $20m in the following year and the burden of legal aid funding  clearly shifted to the State and Territory governments over the following years.  It was not until the 2003-04 

 year (the financial year just ended) that Commonwealth funding came back to anywhere near the level it  was in 1996 (but with no growth) and even then the State governments were paying a significantly higher  proportion of the total bucket of money.  

 But what rubs salt into the wound of these cuts is that they weren't in anyway matched the Government  cutting costs on its own expenditure on legal advice.  In fact, while hacking into legal aid, the Government  happily spent twice as much on its own legal advice as it spends on all its community justice initiatives,  including legal aid and community legal centres.   

 I just ask you to think closely about that fact - in one year (2001-2) the Federal Government spent $268  million on legal advice for Government but only around $135 million, or half that, on Commonwealth legal aid  and community legal services.  It is an overwhelming statistic,but it certainly clarifies the spending priorities 

 of this Government.  That is, make sure the Government is represented by a QC in an immigration matter  and not worry about ordinary mums and dads who can't get legal aid for their family law dispute - or that the  local community legal centre can't get a new photocopier because they barely get CPI increases. Of 

 relevance to this conference, the cost of government advice each year translates into more than 10 times  what is spent by the Commonwealth on community legal centres.  These skewed priorities have to stop.  

 The Coalition government also introduced very early in their term new guidelines for Commonwealth legal  aid restricting the range of matters that their funding could be spent on to matters under Commonwealth  laws - such as social security and family law.  The restrictions are so severe that a person may qualify for  assistance for their custody dispute but not for assistance in the State court matters between the same  parties on a related violence matter.  

 Anyone involved in the law knows that such clear-cut distinctions hardly ever apply to human beings, and  are even less likely to apply to citizens who are already financially disadvantaged and in need of legal  assistance and the distinctions are causing problems.  

 So I am pleased to commit today that Labor will remove the existing severe restrictions on use of  Commonwealth legal aid money to allow the allocated Legal Aid money to go further and to give Legal Aid  Commissions more discretion to use money effectively and in the best interests of their clients.   

 We will listen to and work with the Commissions and encourage developments in primary dispute resolution,  particularly in family law areas, and proactively work with Legal Aid Commissions on their plans to expand  duty solicitor services.  We will keep some controls, particularly to ensure family law matters are still  prioritised, but believe more flexibility to Commissions and less duplication of reporting will deliver better 

 outcomes for Australians needing assistance before the courts.  

 Labor also makes 3 other commitments, we will:  

 â¢ Remove the litigation restrictions on the Environment Defenders Office something that they are  currently prohibited from doing (except in NSW) and presents a major impediment in advocating for  their causes.   

 â¢ Cancel the ATSILS tender process which has been so misconceived and mishandled and could  leave indigenous Australians with worse access to legal assistance than before the 1992 Royal  Commission into deaths in custody.  

 â¢ Move the administration of legal assistance to asylum seekers from DIMIA to AGs, recognising a  conflict of interest if DIMIA maintains this role as well as assessing the claims.  

 Of course, one of the major interests of delegates here is the clear funding crisis for community legal  centres.  It would be hard to find a Commonwealth program anywhere else that for $23 million can achieve  so much.  I know that a lack of funds is making some services untenable, let alone unable to meet growing  demand.  

 As an Opposition trying to win Government it is difficult to find any money readily available to immediately fix  this problem.  The calls on our health system, keeping quality education affordable and developing a fair tax  and family benefit package are high, and need to be prioritised.  

 Once in Government, of course, we understand the pressing need to address the matter urgently and intend  to do so - particularly talking with the National Association of community legal centres about priorities.  

 In addition, I can commit that the community legal centres program will have first claim to any new money for  the AG's Department which becomes available.  

 Further, I can commit to reform the process and amount of expenditure on our external legal advice to  government, and intend to funnel these savings straight into community justice programs.  Labor wants the  Office of Legal Services Coordination to do the job is title implies not simply write guidelines which are  neither obeyed, nor does it insist upon Departmental reporting of performance measured against them.  

 Law Reform  

 Labor has many law reform commitments but I want to spend my limited time today on what is broadly a  human rights plan to take to the Australian public as part of this Federal election campaign.   

 Elements of this plan will be familiar to you because they have been discussed and raised in various  different policy areas - but when brought together you will see that this is a substantial package of changes  and seeks to bring together a range of different commitments in a human rights framework.  

 Firstly, Labor commits to restoring the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the prominence  it deserves as our leading, independent human rights organisation.  Labor will value the expertise of the  Commission and respect its independence.   

 Labor recognises that at the Commonwealth level our anti-discrimination laws have grown up piece by  piece, clause by clause and lack a desirable consistency that now appears in some of the state legislation.   

 Our newest Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation passed by the Parliament in just the last few  months - the Age Discrimination Act - has weaker standards and tests for discrimination based on age, than  in our other legislation.  This is an example of where Labor is committed to what you might describe as  "repair work".  In Government we would ensure our anti-discrimination legislation is strengthened, made  more consistent and provides the protection that all Australians deserve.   

 Labor will introduce protection from harassment on the grounds of age (also excluded in the latest Bill) and  sexuality.  In addition to stronger protections for harassment, Labor will legislate to prohibit vilification on the  grounds of race, religion and sexuality.   

 The commitment to introduce protection from harassment and vilification on the grounds of sexuality goes  hand in hand with our commitment to deliver same sex couples full equality with Australian de facto  heterosexual couples.  We intend to achieve this through a comprehensive review of all Commonwealth  legislation to identify and remove discrimination against same sex couples.  This is a similar process that  has been undertaken by many State Labor counterparts.  The one exception is the Marriage Act.  

 Outside the direct discrimination area, but very much connected to it, is Labor's commitment to establishing  a $ 1.4 million pay equity fund that would enable both sides to apply for financial assistance to run a case  before the Industrial Relations Commission where there are agreed facts.   

 The fund and its guidelines will be based on the model used in Queensland and was announced as part of  our new Women's Policy.  It is part of our broader commitment to reducing the pay equity gap that has  widened between men and women under the current Government, and tackling the casualisation of the  workforce by strengthening options to request conversion to a part time job with leave entitlements and more  security.   

 We have previously announced Labor's plan to combat violence against women.  Labor sees freedom from  violence as a key human rights issue without which women can never hope to participate fully in our  community.  Confronting this issue needs leadership from the top, and under Labor you will get it.  

 The issue of rights for children in Australia is also becoming a hot topic in the community.  Australia was  instrumental in drafting the Convention on the Rights of the Child many years ago, however there has been  very little done at the Commonwealth level to put these rights into any sort of domestic framework.  Early in  this parliamentary term, Labor committed to establishing a National Commissioner for Children and Young  People.   

 When I was our spokesperson on children I had the honour of introducing the Better Future for Our Kids Bill  and believe it is a way for us to ensure those who are often voiceless in the national debate will have  someone speaking for them and an effective conduit to be heard.  It will allow the debate about children's  rights to mature, without constantly being presented, wrongly, as an attack on parents.  

 We have also announced our plans for a more humane approach to refugees and asylum seekers.  There is  a better balance and we all know it.  Labor will maintain short term detention for the purposes only of basic  health, security and identity checks, and we will not detain children in high security facilities. Under a Labor  Government, we would also return centres to government control and have them open to independent  inspection.    As mentioned above, Labor will transfer asylum seeker legal support to AGs removing a clear  conflict of interest.  

 On the international front, we have committed to signing the Optional Protocol for the Convention for the  Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Optional Protocol for the  Convention Against Torture.   

 A Labor Attorney would also ensure that the rights of Australians citizens detained overseas comply with  basic international standards - a role, it cannot be said, that our current Attorney has adopted.  The Prime  Minister, the Attorney-General and the Foreign Minister have never expressed reservations about the  validity of their detention or the military commission process, even although the inadequacies and injustices  have been plain for all to see.   

 The PM even said a few weeks ago, astonishingly, that he understood the ordinary rules of criminal justice  would apply to the military commission.  The ordinary rules except that the military is prosecutor, judge and  jury, only one of the panel of judges is legally qualified, the rules of evidence do not apply, and the only right  of appeal is to the US President and, the icing on the cake, an acquittal will not necessarily lead to release -  but other than that the normal standards of justice apply!  

 Our Government's silence on the treatment of Mr Hicks and Habib is shameful - and unnecessary.  It paints  Australia as a nation afraid to raise human rights and justice issues with our major ally.  

 This is something Labor will not be afraid to do - and we note that America's other strong allies, like the  British, have been able to raise these issues without severing or unduly damaging their relationship.  

 This is a long list - because there is much to be done - but it all has an underlying theme of fairness and fair  treatment, giving all Australians an opportunity in life.  

 Them and us discrimination  

 Let me finish with something I find profoundly disturbing (In addition to what already covered).  

 One of the most insidious results of the Prime Minister's last 8 years in Government is his penchant for  twisting issues and dividing the community in a manner that has helped breed a culture of intolerance to  others.  His repeated singling out of minority groups and wilful misrepresentation of the role and impact of  anti-discrimination legislation, has given Prime Ministerial approval to others who copy his actions.  

 He has regularly favoured using anti discrimination laws (and proposed changes to them) to turn  categorisation, exclusion, division and marginalisation in our community into a political art form for others to  emulate with impunity.    He thinks it is a free kick to call those who don't agree with him "politically correct"  and to position himself as the master of commonsense.   

 In this analysis, the Prime Minister forgets that it is commonsense to treat people fairly and without  prejudice.   

 The strategy seems to be for the PM to turn the ‘them and us" mentality into a plan for votes, no matter what  the long term cost in the community.  The Prime Minister's interest in division isn't limited to particular  groups, but has become his framework for they way he presents and positions himself in any looming  political issue.   

 Just consider a few divisions courtesy of Howard's world view:  

 â¢ The hard working parents saving to send their kids to private schools - and public school parents;  

 â¢ Same sex couples - and everyone else;  

 â¢ Those of us who deserve a fair trial - and those who are accused as "terrorists";  

 â¢ The stay at home mums - versus the working mums;   

 â¢   "Those type of people" who throw their kids overboard in contrast to the people we would  welcome to this country;  

 â¢ the good employees who work diligently and earn more than $52,000 a year - versus anyone else  who in his mind doesn't deserve any tax relief, and of course   

 â¢ The poor and frail who deserve a Medicare safety net - and everyone else who should pay their  way.  

 The list goes on.  It constantly divides our community and ultimately, I believe, damages it - perhaps  irreparably.  

 Almost any political issue you care to pick - you'll find John Howard on the side where he wants votes and  on the other side those people he has calculated it is more useful to use to highlight difference, irrespective  of the alienation it causes.   The categories chosen by the PM can be divided over very mainstream issues 

 (like public school parents) or those that affect only small groups of people, but the approach is the same -  Mr Howard as leader of the Liberal Party weighing up whose side he wants to be on and what benefit it  might deliver him to use other people to create this contrast.  

 This is the complete opposite to the ladder of opportunity inclusiveness of the Labor Party - built piece by  piece but designed to assist and include not draw apart.  

 Conclusion  

 Labor believes that we have a significant point of difference from this Government when it comes managing  the justice system in a better and fairer manner, when it comes to expenditure of public money and when it  comes to law reform and promoting inclusion instead of division.  

 I believe an Australian Attorney-General should operate within a strong social justice framework, within a  framework that supports and promotes the rule of law and respects the need for people to have access to  justice, and their right to be protected against extreme action of governments.   

 To have this, we need an Attorney who respects the Courts and their role in our democracy.  We must  support and adequately resource the federal courts and the administration of justice so it can serve all the  community and acknowledge the importance of a strong, fearless and competent judiciary in a modern  democracy.  

 I look forward to having the chance to bring about these changes, and thank you for inviting me to speak  today and hear part of Labor's agenda for the country.
