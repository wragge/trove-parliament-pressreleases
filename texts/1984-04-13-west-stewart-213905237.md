 COMMUNIQUE

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 The H on. STEWART WEST, M.P.

 13 April 1984

 Commonwealth and State Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs,  today gave their continuing support for a steady  immigration program in 1984/85.

 The Ministers were meeting in Brisbane today to discuss  overall direction for immigration and ethnic affairs policies  and programs.

 The Federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,   Stewart West,  in presenting the views of the Conference,   said that all Ministers had shown support for the existing  non-discriminatory immigration policies.

 "The Ministers agreed that the emphasis on family reunion  should continue in 1984/85", Mr West said.

 "It was also agreed that the versification of refugee  sources should continue,  in keeping with our philosophy  that immigration intake should reflect humanitarian  concerns".

 Mr West said the Conference supported the skilled labour  and business migration programs, which are based on  careful assessment of employment needs and opportunities  throughout Australia,  and held the view that,  under more 

 favourable economic circumstances those programs could be  moderately increased.

 "I and my State Colleagues also discussed a range of  settlement and post-arrival policies",  Mr West said.

 State Ministers requested urgent action by the Commonwealth  Government on the Fry Committee Report and the recognition  of overseas qualifications.

 "State Government^ have pledged their full co-operation once  this important problem is addressed",  Mr West said.

 "The Conference also raised the question of Commonwealth  support for State initiatives in education and welfare  services.

 "I have assured the Conference that I will raise these  matters with my colleagues,  especially matters relating  to welfare and education services for refugees.

 "New agreements for adult migrant education,  the provision  of language services,  the Migrant Resource Centre Program  and the current situation regarding migrant accommodation  centres were also discussed.

 "It has also been agreed that all Ministers should continue  to consult and co-operate to ensure a co-ordinated and  effective immigration program",  Mr West concluded.
