 NAURU DETAINEE’S RELEASE AFTER 6 YEARS WELCOME   

 Democrat Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett has welcomed news of the release of  Iraqi refugee, Muhammad Faisal from detention after a protracted battle over his security status, but  condemned the extreme and unnecessary suffering that was inflicted on him. 

 Media Statement   Wednesday 31 Feb 2007

 “The news that he has finally received the all clear from ASIO and can now be released into the care of  a supportive community is a great relief,” Senator Bartlett said.  

 “It is simply outrageous, however, that he was kept locked up all those years on the basis of an ASIO  security assessment that has no been rescinded.” 

 “The stress this man has been placed under after numerous failed attempts to get to the bottom of the  original adverse security finding by ASIO has been enormously detrimental. 

 “I met with Muhammad Faisal three times during his five year stay on Nauru and twice in Brisbane  since he was transferred here for extensive medical treatment at the insistence of Nauru’s government.   

 “I have witnessed first hand the suffering and deterioration of his physical and mental health and it has  been extremely harrowing and distressing. 

 “Muhammad Faisal was been in limbo for nearly six years, facing an insecure future, enforced isolation  and a loss of familial and social support.  He suffered greatly and I hope that this welcome albeit  belated good news can help him on his way to recovery,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
