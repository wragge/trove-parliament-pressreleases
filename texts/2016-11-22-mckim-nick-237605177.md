 Media Release: UNHCR says Australia is undermining global refugee system 

 November 22, 2016 

 The UNHCR has told an inquiry into allegations of abuse in Australia's offshore detention centres that  the government's policies are undermining the global refugee system.   

 "The  UNHCR  have  made  it  clear  that  by  denying  refugees  access  to  Australia,  the  government  is   weakening  the  international  framework  to  resettle  refugees,"  Greens  Immigration  spokesperson   Senator Nick McKim said.   

 "They have submitted that Australia has deliberately exposed people to harm, and failed to meet our  legal obligations."   

 "The UNHCR have also made it clear that sending desperate people to offshore detention centres does  not absolve Australia of its duty of care."   

 "In short, as the government has essentially conceded, offshore detention is not viable."   

 "This is why every man, woman and child that Australia is detaining on Manus Island and Nauru must  be brought to Australia."
