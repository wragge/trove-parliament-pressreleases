 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Torture advocate should be sacked  from Refugee Review Tribunal  17th May 2005 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called for Professor Mirko Bagaric to  be sacked from his position on the Refugee Review Tribunal because of  his published views in support of torture.  "It's clearly inappropriate for a person who supports the use of torture  to be sitting in judgement on asylum seekers, many of whom will be  torture victims themselves. Professor Bargaric should be sacked from  the Tribunal," Senator Nettle said.  "The danger of having a person with such outragous ethical views on  the Refugee Review Tribunal is exacerbated by the fact that the  Tribunal allows just one person to decide and review each case.  "The Minister reappointed Professor Bargaric just last year, did she  make any attempt to look into his views on these issues?  "The Minister should act immediately to sack Professor Bargaric or risk  being tainted by the frightening views of Professor Bargaric.   "Professor Bargaric has published numerous articles advocating a strict  utilitarian ethic which is notorious for justifying suffering of the few to  boost the happiness for the rest.  "The application of the logic Professor Bargaric advocates could easily  be used to justify the ongoing detention of refugees, and as such  should raise serious concerns about his role on the Tribunal"
