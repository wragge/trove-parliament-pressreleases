 Bid for refugee status rejected *

 By TON Y WRIOHT

 ' A young Vietnamese playwright now  ‘Viving in Canberra has been refused ref-  dMgee status in Australia and has been  told he must return to Vietnam.

 The Minister for Immigration, Senator  . Robert Ray, said in a statement yesterday that  : the Government had received assurances from the Vietnamese Government that the young 

 ; man, TaDuyBinh, would not flee any form or  persecution when be returned.  He said Mr Binh had been refused permis-  " sion to  stay in Australia as he did not meet any 

 ofth e criteria for the grant o f residency. How­  . ever, he would be allowed to apply for migra­ tion to Australia in the normal way, once he  returned to Vietnam. " â   ' 

 Any application from M r Binh would be  given sympathetic consideration. Discussion  to d  been initiated with the Vietnamese au­  thorities to ensure that this was possiWe.

 â¢ Senator Ray said visitors to Australia could  not antomatically assume that they would be  allowed to stay permanently upon reguest 

 . Prominent members o f the Vietnamese  community in Australia say the attempt to  obttiin assurances from Vietnam that M r Binh  . would not be punished and that he be allowed 

 i return to Australia as a  migrant would be

 Mr Binh came to Australia in August to  attend the Second International Festival o f  Youth Playwrights in Sydney. The Vietnamese  Government had declined to pay his fare and 

 he was flown to Australia by Qantas. , After he arrived he took refuge with sympe-  ihisers and originally sought political asylum

 in the name o f freedom ofspeech, thought and  artistic creativity. In September M rBinh appealed directly to  the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, in a telegram aslting for “the opportunity to live and write in 

 the freedom o f Australia*.  As in all such mattery his case would have  been studied by the D etennbation o f Refugee  Status Committee. · ........ . :

 The committee includes representatives  â   from the departments o f Foreign Aftairs and  T rade Prime Minister and ew in e t, Attop·  ney-GeneraTs. and Immigration, with a n o b - 

 server from the office o f the United Nations  HighComnussionerforRdfugees. A spokesman for the Vietnamese C om m u-.  nity in Australia said yesterday that from pest  experiences, no Vietnamese within « o u tsid e  

 Australia, could honestly believe the word o f ,  the Vietnamese Government in regard to as­ surances about peoide who had sos^ht to leave  the country and then to d  been returned. 

 "They may give guarantees, but who will  guarantee the guarantees?" he said. ' ' "The Austialian G ovenim enrhat no con­ trol over the internal aflairs o f the Vietnamese  G overnm entanditsdtizens. 

 “The Vietnamese Government has «"â <

 While b  Australia, M r Binh had expressed  his abhorrence o f the Hanoi regime an a there­ fore could not expect to escape punishment,  according to the spokesman. 

 Mrs Marion Le, o f the IndoC hina Refugee  Association, said documents obtained from

 government sources relating to assurances riv­ en last year to four Vietnamese students from  the Gmberra College o f Advanced Education  who to d  sought resfdencyshowed that officers 

 o f the Department o f Foreign Affairs mid  Trade had initially believed they could moni­ tor tbe students* safety on their return to Viet­ 

 nam. Î³  . ..

 " : But they later changed their opinions and  recorded that “ ...w h ile  it was difficult to  predict what would happen to [them! on re­ turn*, it was lik e ly  that they would nave an . 

 unpleasant ‘debriefing* [and] might have to  undergo some form o f‘re-education*. . .  [and]  there was potential for it to be quite harsh . â   The report had also stated that the students 

 would be "worse off than most people” should  they return to Vietnem. The students eventu­  ally wereeltowed to r e m a b b  Australia.  Mrs Le said it to d  taken the Department o f 

 Foreign Affairs a long time to reach conclu­ sions that Vietnamese m  Australia to d  held all  along. In M r Bmh’l  case, Australian Vietnamese 

 found it impossible to believe that he would  escape punishment or that he would be al­ lowed to leave Vietnam once he had returned  there, she said. .

 “M r Binh may have been naive in his simple  trust that the Australian Government would  respond to his request for asylum, but he is not  naive enough to believe the assurances o f the  Vietnamese G overnm ent" 

 M r Binh, b  a statement issued through  ICRA, said be could not believe the promises  o f the Vietnamese Government

 “I f  I was to return to Vietnam they would  never permit me to leave again," he said. "I  believe Australia would honour its promises,  but never Vietnam." T a Duy Binh . . .  refused refugee statu s.

 3300 SENATE 1 December 1988 Questions without Notice Questions without Notice

 previous State election and that he had com­ mitted the greatest crime in Q ueensland-  even greater than child molesting—and had  voted Labor! On that basis------

 Senator Stoee—It is pretty serious offence.

 Senator ROBERT RAY—The carpetbag­ ger interjects that this is a serious offence. I  think Senator Stone has admitted that he  voted Labor on one occasion. This just shows 

 the inconsistent standards o f the Premier of  Queensland—that he would knock off a Chief  Justice because he once voted Labor but  would bring Senator Stone here at Senator 

 Collard’s expense.

 Getting back to the main thrust of the  question, I believe that this could not happen  at a Federal election. I am not versed enough  in terms of the Queensland electoral laws 

 and procedures to know whether it would  be possible to determine who voted where  by postal vote. But at a Federal level postal  votes are returned and, when they are 

 opened, the votes are placed upside down  and are counted in multiples; and it would  be very unusual—in fact, I think almost im­ possible—to source the vote back to a par­

 ticular individual. 1 have previously had to  compare the Queensland Government with  the Government of Louisiana in the 1930s,  but 1 must say, having heard that particular 

 allegation, that Huey Long was a dead-set  amateur.

 PLAYW RIGHT TA DUY BINH  Senator CHANEY—My question, which is also directed to the Minister for Immigra­ tion, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs,  seeks a different assurance from the one  sought by Senator Bums. W hat guarantees 

 has the Minister received from Vietnam that  the playwright Ta Duy Binh, who has been  refused refugee status by the Government,  will not be punished on his return to his own  country? What form will the guarantees take 

 and who has given them? W ho in the bu­ reaucracy or in the Government accepts re­ sponsibility in the event that this young man  is ill treated when he returns to Vietnam? 

 Does the Minister accept responsibility? Can  he give an assurance about his safety? Will  the Minister give a further assurance beyond  his reported sympathetic consideration that 

 Mr Binh will be able to migrate to Australia

 if he applies in the normal way when he  returns home?

 Senator ROBERT RAY—M r Binh ar­ rived in Australia, I think, to  attend a  c u l- ,  tural function. It is quite clear from the 1   interview with M r Binh that, before he left 1  

 Vietnam, he had always intended to apply ‘  for refugee status in Australia. He applied j  for refugee status. It was considered by the (  Determination of Refugee Status Committee, (  which unanimously rejected his refugee j 

 claims, including, I might add, in the tech-1  nical sense also supported by the United j  National High Commissioner for Refugees. I  Having been refused at that level, it is now 

 up to M r Binh, under his legal obligations, j  to return to Vietnam.

 O f course, this case differs from any other j  refugee cases in as much as it has had a lot j  of publicity. T hu gives us a long term prob- j  lem in dealing with any of those cases. If 1 

 someone is not a  refugee by definition but,]  by attacking his homeland country in the]  media, he automatically becomes a refugee,]  that has long term implications for visitor I 

 programs to this country and our immigra-j  tion policy. Everybody realises that Australia]  is a large immigration country. Every realises]  that, sadly, many people miss out in their]  applications to come here. If it is seen that,] 

 by using refugee status, people can emigrate]  to Australia and miss the normal immigra-]  tion criteria, we would be facing a serious!  situation.

 I will come to some of the honourable]  senator’s specific points in a moment. W ei  can deal with this matter in a number o f]  ways. We can say that we will allow n o ] 

 more visitors from this country, and I am ]  certain that that could also be the reaction]  at the other end. We treat these refugee] 

 cases on an individual basis and not on a ]   class baas. We do not have a class of refit·]  gees, such as Tamils, Vietnamese, or Le-1  banese. This is often confused.

 Obviously, having refused M r Binh’s ap-1  plication for refugee status, we have had]  some concerns as to whether he would b e l  persecuted. Having looked at his previous! 

 history in Vietnam, where he was not subject]  to any persecution—and that is quite clear ]   from the evidence—discussions have taken]  place between M r Simmington from my Do-]

 -pertinent and officials from the Vietnamese  ' -Embassy. Those discussions are continuing * roe a  couple of points. The dialogue is contin-  - eing. The indication from the Vietnamese  ’ Opvemment is fairly clearly that the gentle-

 m*n concerned will not be subject to any  " , -abuse or maltreatment. , -- probably the one remaining factor that is â¢ M** d ear in my mind yet from the discus-

 held between officials is whether the  ' Vietnamese Government would put an arti-  ; ipejal barrier in the way o f M r Binh’s appli-  ^Cation to come to Australia. The relationships  - 'Jbetween the Government of Vietnam and 

 -.'Australia on immigration matters are contin­ u a lly improving. We now have an agreement  “ **· an orderly departure system, an immigra-  system, to Australia which is a big 

 -.-—through. It means that many families  Vietnam that want to come to Australia  longer have to make the arduous march  gieemps or travel on boats, et cetera. We 

 ’ establishing an orderly migration pro·  for the reunification of relatives. This  not an easy case, but I believe that if it  handled incorrectly we would endanger 

 orderly departure program, and many  people would be potential sufferers. honourable senator asked me what  ntecs I could give. No Minister can give  [Absolute guarantee. I cannot give an ab­ "" ’ guarantee that if I deport someone 

 . to New York tomorrow that they will  _  ‘ I for the rest of their life without being  ifed, mugged or something else. I cannot  > absolute guarantees. One is required to 

 "" i best judgment available. When deter-  t refugee cases I do not determine them  y, we have an interdepartmental com­ , as I think the previous Government  FT, which very carefully measures the case  p an y  refugee. I point out that the process  “  Australia takes three months, and some- 

 it is quicker. The process in other  ntries, through the courts, takes longer,  r instance, in Canada it takes seven years.  » interesting thing is that the success rate  ^ '  Australia is identical to that of Canada—  Pjjper cent. That a t least reassures me that 

 procedures are not particularly off-key. I said, this was not an easy case on  i to make a judgment. I understand that  [Where is still one point to be clarified in the 

 t negotiations. Having given those assurances,

 1 December 1988 SENATE 3301

 I think the Government of Vietnam would  be very conscious of its image in this country  and of the development of the relations be­ tween the two and would not wish to breach 

 them. Senator Chaney asked me whether I  would take personal responsibility. Every time  a refugee goes home, every time someone is  deported, I have to take that responsibility.

 Senator CHANEY—I ask a supplemen­ tary question, M r President. I thank the  Minister for his reply. I note that he made  the point in his reply that it is a m atter of 

 achieving the best judgment one can make  in these admittedly very difficult matters. I  also note that the Minister said that the 

 Government had received assurances. I do  not think the Minister in his reply dealt with  the form of these assurances. I would like  him to give the Senate more detail on the  nature of the assurances given and the rea­ son for his judgment that the assurances are  satisfactory, bearing in mind the reports that  an examination of earlier cases involving stu­ dents from Vietnam has led officials to change  their initial view that a return was a matter  that could be countenanced. I ask the Min­ ister, what form of assurance or guarantee  he has received from the Vietnamese Gov­ ernment, and why that satisfies him that the 

 position is secure.

 Senator ROBERT RAY—As I indicated  to Senator Chaney, the discussions are not  complete. There have been two rounds of  discussions on this matter, and assurances  have been given to our officials by the Viet­ namese Embassy on behalf of the Vietnam­ ese Government. Another issue being  discussed at the moment is whether an Aus­ tralian civilian can accompany M r Binh back 

 to Vietnam for the three or four months we  assume he will be there. That also is under  discussion. It would not be an Australian 

 official because, I think, the Vietnamese  Government would object. Again, I hope in  the next couple of days to get a report about  how those negotiations are going.
