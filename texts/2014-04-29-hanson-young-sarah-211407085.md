 Greens: close Manus, save billions   

 Closing the offshore detention camps on Manus Island and Nauru would end unnecessary and  dangerous cruelty while saving the budget billions of dollars ahead of the budget, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 “The cost of offshore detention, in both human and monitory terms, is shocking,” the Australian  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Billions of dollars are being spent every year on these camps of cruelty and those costs are  steadily increasing.   

 “While the Prime Minister is preparing to tax Australian households more, he’s ignoring the  billion dollar black hole that is offshore detention.   

 “As more reports surface from that bloody Manus night in February, many Australians are  realising that offshore cruelty simply isn’t worth it.   

 “Processing people offshore, bringing more refugees to Australia and then letting them  contribute to our economy would save both money and lives, but the Abbott Government simply  isn’t interested.   

 “Ignoring this obvious savings measure while introducing multiple new taxes has once again  shown Tony Abbott’s twisted priorities.”
