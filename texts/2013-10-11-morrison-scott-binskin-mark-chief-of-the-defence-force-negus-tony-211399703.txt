 The Hon. Scott Morrison MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 

 Operation Sovereign Borders  Friday, 11 October 2013 

 Press Conference, Sydney 

 Joint Press Conference with Scott Morrison - Minister for Immigration and  Border Protection, Air Marshal Mark Binskin - Vice-Chief of the Defence Force  and Commissioner Tony Negus - Australian Federal Police. 

 Scott Morrison: Welcome to [indistinct] Operation Sovereign Borders. Today I'm  joined once again by Acting Commander Binskin, and for the first time today  Commissioner Negus. 

 Operation Sovereign Borders is not just about offshore processing and maritime  operations. It is about disruption and deterrence throughout the region and as well as  breaking up networks of support for the criminals who are engaged in people  smuggling here in Australia. 

 This element of the Joint Agency Taskforce, or the JATF, is led by the AFP under the  leadership of Assistant Commissioner Lancaster. Those who may be in Australia  should know this in terms of providing support to people smugglers: If you're  supporting people smugglers by paying them, even on behalf of family members,  providing contacts or information, referring people to smugglers or providing any  form of assistance, you can expect to come to the attention of the Australian Federal  Police. If you're on any form of visa here in this country and are convicted of an  offence relating to that support, you will also lose your visa. You owe it to family  members not to help them get on a boat but to stop them getting on a boat. 

 This past week has seen our dialogue with Indonesian officials continue in  preparation for my first meeting with Air Chief Marshal Suyanto. This morning Acting  Commander Binskin and commissioner Negus and Special Envoy Molan all returned  from Jakarta from the latest of these discussions. This afternoon I will meet with the  Indonesian Minister for Law and Human Rights, His Excellency Amir Syamsuddin,  who is responsibility for immigration, where we'll continue this dialogue, all aimed at  building up operational understandings between our governments within a broader  framework of strategic trust. 

 On Wednesday evening I returned from a two day visit to Nauru where I had the  opportunity to once again meet with the President, cabinet ministers, and senior  opposition members, as I have done on many occasions when in opposition. I held  extensive discussions also with our service providers on operational issues, I  inspected facilities and the expansion works previously announced from this podium  that are now under way. I also toured the hospital and spoke to local health officials. 

 And most importantly, I visited the centres both for single adult males and for family  groups to deliver a very direct message to both of those groups that under the new  government, they will not be coming to Australia, they will not be getting what they  came for, that the people smugglers had ripped them off and they must now make  decisions about what they do next, and the Australian Government, together with  Nauruan Government will facilitate them returning home if they choose to do so. 

 On Nauru, expansion is also well under way and we are able to meet any demand  on those centres that may be presented. The two day transfer target is quickly  translating into smooth practice and process for arrivals. I want to commend all of the  team for the excellent work they have done, together with our partners on Nauru and  on Manus Island and the PNG Government, that have assisted with the  implementation of the new government's policies in this respect. 

 Making sure offshore processing is applied universally without exceptions, having  people transferred promptly and getting the follow-up measures and procedures in  place to facilitate removal is critical. This is what offshore processing is all about. It's  not just about having some tents on an island, it is about ensuring that you can  actually implement the purpose of these policies, and the implementation focus of  the new government is making a very significant difference to how these centres are  operating. 

 More than 2000 people who arrived under the previous government were not  transferred to offshore processing by that government who arrived post July 19. The  vast majority, the overwhelming vast majority, of those who have arrived since the  establishment of Operation Sovereign Borders have all been sent to Nauru or Manus  Island or are in another removal pathway or process because of the nature of their  arrival. In particular I refer to a group that we mentioned from this podium a few  weeks ago where there were claims about their Indian nationality. It's all about  implementation when it comes to this operation, not about announcements. 

 On Nauru, we commence the process also to put in place a five year arrangement,  to regularise our operations on Nauru and provide greater certainty and stability for  all the parties involved in these operations and for both governments. This is in stark  contrast to the pre-election position where, for example, there was no operational  funding provided by the previous government for the operation of offshore  processing centres from 1 January next year. A five year agreement recognises that  post assessment, people will remain on Nauru. Our operations go beyond  processing, those who have turned up in Australia illegally on boats, they go to the  issue of post processing accommodation. Critical to that initiative is to establish that  accommodation. The previous government had made no provision or plans to  accommodate people after their processing was completed on Nauru or on Manus  Island, for that matter. 

 This week we agreed to commence the planning and consultation process in Nauru  to establish post-processing accommodation for families in Nauru. We have also  commenced planning for the accommodation where works are already under way on  Manus Island at the East Lorengau site for that to be used as post-process  accommodation for single adult males, so post-processing accommodation on 

 Nauru for families, post-processing accommodation on Manus Island for single adult  males, and further options are being looked at on both locations. 

 Persons found to be not refugees will remain in the camps until they go home.  Without this accommodation in place for post-processing, the threat of people not  coming to Australia was hollow and without substance. By moving to establish these  facilities, the Abbott Government can back up our policy that says you will not be  coming to Australia, and we mean what we say. Our discussion on the five year  arrangement will also address infrastructure and service needs on Nauru, in  particular in relation to the hospital and utilities plant. Such facilities will provide a  significant legacy for the people of Nauru as a result of the establishment of those  facilities. 

 Nauru is already realising the benefits of the operation of these centres. I was  pleased to learn while I was there that more than 600 direct jobs have been taken up  by Nauruan’s throughout these facilities directly. The centres are now the second  largest employer on Nauru after their own government. Progress has also been  made on staff accommodation, the HMAS Choules currently providing  accommodation for staff at the Manus Island centre, is scheduled to depart on 31  October. Bibby Progress, a moored maritime accommodation platform, will take over  this role and will arrive prior to the Choules’ departure for the changeover. It can  accommodate over 300 staff. 

 On Nauru, more than 125 beds have been handed over for staff accommodation  from the first phase of the staff accommodation development project at Anibare Bay  on Nauru. I had an opportunity to inspect that new accommodation on Wednesday.  This will add important new capacity to enable us to ramp up operations. By  expanding the centres, it's not just about providing the places in the centres  themselves, you need to be able to put the staff accommodation in place to support  the expansion of the centres and that's what's occurring. The second half of those  accommodation places for staff will be handed over before the end of the month. 

 In other matters, finally, I note that yesterday I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of  Singapore, where we discussed the regional dimensions to the people smuggling  and border protection related issues, including maritime issues, and I welcome that  visit and I wish the minister well for the events that are taking place in Sydney this  weekend, sponsored by the Singaporean Government. ' With that, I will pass you  onto the Acting Commander Binskin to provide his report, and then Commissioner  Negus. 

 Mark Binskin: Thank you, Minister. This is the Operation Sovereign Borders weekly  briefing for the period nine o'clock Friday 4th October until nine o'clock this morning.  And it is a week that we've had consistent weather with what we would normally see  over the periods annually, so it has been a good weather period up around the  operational areas. 

 During the reporting period, there were no arrivals transferred to the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection, and this means that in the first three weeks of  Operation Sovereign Borders, there has been a total of 215 arrivals transferred.  However, you will be aware as of late yesterday a boat arrived at Cocos Keeling 

 Islands. Consistent with normal practice for these reports, the number of people on  board this vessel will be reflected in the next report once those people have been  processed at Christmas Island. I do want to emphasise, though, that the people who  came to Australia on board this boat by now already understand that they will not be  settled in Australia. 

 For the reporting period, a total of 111 people were transferred to offshore  processing centres, and all these people were transferred to Manus. Since the  commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders on 18 September 2013 until nine  o'clock this morning, a total of 402 people have been transferred to offshore  processing centres. That's 115 people transferred to Nauru, all people from family  groups, and 287 people transferred to Manus. In addition, 47 people who arrived  before 8 September were transferred to offshore processing centres between 18 and  20 September. 

 As at nine o'clock this morning, there are a total of 1059 people at Manus and 800  people at Nauru, and there were 2176 people in the Christmas Island facilities. Also  at nine o'clock this morning, there were 94 minors in family group accommodated at  Nauru, and we have sufficient offshore processing capacity to meet the transfer  requirements for the future. 

 In other operational activities, with the disruption and deterrence task group, they've  been working with Indonesia to provide interpreting and investigative assistance in  relation to ongoing operations. Lebanese authorities working with the task group  have arrested five persons for questioning in relation to the recent tragic event off the  west coast of Java. The task group has also been providing operational support to  police in Sri Lanka and is working with regional partners in Vietnam and Malaysia to  increase law enforcement capacity and enhance information sharing arrangements.  And I will let Commissioner Negus provide more of an update on those aspects in a  minute. 

 I would also like to proudly acknowledge the operational release of the Australian  Customs and Border Protection vessel, Cape St George. Cape St George is the first  of a class of improved cape class patrol boats, purposely built for patrolling  Australia's vast open coastlines. The operational release of this vessel will occur  tomorrow, after which Cape St George will deploy in support of Operation Sovereign  Borders. Tomorrow's milestone is a positive example of the advanced maritime  capability positioned at the border in support of Operation Sovereign Borders. 

 I will conclude today's briefing by re-stating that we are involved in a complex border  security operation, and the taskforce remains committed to stopping people  smuggling and ultimately saving lives and I would like to thank those in the taskforce  for their support to me for the operation over the last two weeks. 

 Thank you very much. I will hand over to Commissioner Negus. 

 Tony Negus: Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone. As you've heard, we've  just returned from Indonesia this morning, Air Marshal Binskin and myself. In  Indonesia we had very positive discussions with the chief of the Indonesian National 

 Police, my friend and colleague Timur Pradopo, where he re-committed his support  to supporting Australia to stamp out people smuggling in the region. 

 During the last few weeks, since 8t September specifically, there have been 17  disruptions in Indonesia where over 550 passengers have been stopped getting onto  boats. That's as a result of the co-operative relationship between the AFP, other  agencies here in Australia, and Indonesian National Police. The Indonesian National  Police have also made eight arrests, five crew members from the boats that I've just  talked about, but also, importantly, three high value targets, these are people who  are facilitators and organisers within Indonesia who put people on those boats to  start with. These people are yet to go to court, but will be charged with multiple  venture, and organising multiple ventures to this country. 

 Also, importantly, just yesterday they issued an arrest warrant for a very significant  people smuggler in Indonesia who will be tracked down over coming weeks, and  should appear in court very soon, we hope. 

 Just on the domestic front, and the Minister mentioned the AFP's domestic  operations and how important it is to re-affirm to people that they should not be  involved in supporting people smuggling in this country, four people have been  arrested here in Australia over the last few months and charged with associated  offences relating to 132 vessels reaching the Australian coastline. These people are  now before the courts but I can assure you we have multiple investigations ongoing  within Australia, and we expect further arrests within the coming weeks. And I can  just reiterate what that Minister said, that these people could face substantial periods  in jail with maximum sentences of up to ten years imprisonment. And with that I will  leave it, and hand it back to the Minister. 

 Scott Morrison: Thank you, Commissioner. Questions? 

 Journalist: Have any boats been stopped and turned around in the past week? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, as you know, the practice in these briefings is not to comment  on operations that may jeopardise current or future operations. So, I won't be making  comments on those matters and that's the same policy we've followed in every  briefing. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] any boats that have been intercepted? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, we report on when vessels have been transferred in  Immigration custody and that's the nature of the briefing provided here. 

 Journalist: Are you going to tell us, the people that came to Manus Island, were  they Sri Lankan? 

 Scott Morrison: We don't comment on the nationalities for operational reasons, and  the commander might want to comment on that, but equally, the commander made  the point that at this stage they haven't been processed on Christmas Island yet, and  so until we know who is there and the exact numbers and those sorts of things, it's  not appropriate to give the type of normal briefing we would give on those vessels 

 and that's why you will see that report come in a future briefing, Acting Commander,  do you want to comment on that? 

 Mark Binskin: We don't comment on the nationalities, or speculate. 

 Journalist: Customs used to comment as soon as they found out- 

 Mark Binskin: -Yeah, they used to, but that's not under Operation Sovereign  Borders. 

 Scott Morrison: Operation Sovereign Borders has a different set of rules. We are  not doing things like the previous government used to. Under the previous  government, more than 50 000 people turned up illegally on boats, we're not going to  use the previous government's approach as a model for our operations. 

 Journalist: Is that a decision that's taken on the advice of experts or is that a  decision that was taken by government? 

 Scott Morrison: It's a decision of the JATF. 

 Mark Binskin: And that's consistent with when the JATF stood up three weeks ago. 

 Journalist: Have any boats been stopped in Indonesian waters, or on transit by  Indonesian authorities after being alerted by Australia? 

 Mark Binskin: I will just clarify again, we are not going to talk about operational  measures or operational activities. We will give a summary each week of those boats  and those personnel or people that have been transferred to Australian immigration  authorities, that's it. We're not going to give our posture or talk about our tactics or  our techniques or what's happening on the water because that gives away key  intelligence information to the people smugglers and we don't want to give these  criminals that sort of information. 

 Journalist: Does that blackout also extend to vessels that might be in distress? I  notice that the AMSA website used to put out campaign notices distress signals.  That doesn't seem to be happening anymore- 

 Mark Binskin: -No, AMSA won't give that level of operational information, however,  that doesn't mean that they don't transmit information to maritime vessels in the area  to assist, so it does not impact in any way our ability to respond to any search or  rescue situation, we're just not broadcasting that to the world when it's happening. 

 Journalist: So there's just no transparency, the boats in distress, no one's going to  know about them? 

 Mark Binskin: No, actually the relevant authorities and those who are in a position  to provide assistance do know, so there is no impact on the rescuing of those  people, but we do report in our weekly report here if there was a search and rescue  event. So, there's transparency, you will know if there is a search and rescue event  in that period. 

 Journalist: Can we assume from that there was no rescue? 

 Scott Morrison: I don't think you should - you can make whatever assumptions that  you like. 

 Journalist: Sorry, just following on from your last question. 

 Mark Binskin: So in the period of the last week those people that have arrived -  none - there is a boat that, as we said, that has arrived off Cocos Island, we'll report  those details next week when we have all the details to be able to report. If I haven't  reported it, it hasn't happened. 

 Journalist: There's one boat, that's it. 

 Mark Binskin: There's one boat off- 

 Journalist: -[Indistinct]- 

 Mark Binskin: -So I provide a summary of the weekly activities for those  unauthorised maritime arrivals who have processed into Christmas Island and the  details around that. 

 Scott Morrison: And I make the point- 

 Journalist: -[Indistinct] people have the right [indistinct] talk about the people on  Cocos Island. 

 Mark Binskin: No, and that's as I said in my statement. So in the next week - we're  transparent, but we do work a time line, nine o'clock to nine o'clock, that's to stay  consistent with the reporting, otherwise people start to get mixed up with additional  numbers or less numbers. That's why we're keeping that consistent reporting period. 

 Scott Morrison: I note that vessel which the Acting Commander referred to, which,  you know, once we have processed the people and we know how many there are, et  cetera, and the breakdown, so we can take whatever decisions come next, I should  stress that anyone who would have come from somewhere like Sri Lanka would face  the same, and I strongly suggest an even more stringent process of screening and  screen-out and those who are screened out will go back to Sri Lanka. And so  anyone who may have come from Sri Lanka should know that they will go back to Sri  Lanka. 

 We have an arrangement with the Sri Lankan Government and this government will  certainly be taking that arrangement very seriously and will be ensuring that we  maximise those who go back and preferably they will all go back. 

 Journalist: Just in regards to nationality how is that operational security when in fact  if you do would it send a message back to places like Sri Lanka, why can't you  identify...? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, I just sent a message to the people of Sri Lanka 

 Journalist: But with the boats that come in, not identifying what nationality they are. 

 Scott Morrison: Well, this is the difference. From this podium, you're not going to  get those sorts of threats. What will happen is that people will know the experience  of what our policies are. The most effective way a message is conveyed is not on  YouTube by governments. It's actually by the lived experience of those who are  subjected to our policies and those individuals will know what has taken place and  those individuals will relay those stories. 

 This is exactly the way it worked back when the Howard Government implemented  those policies then. There were no YouTube videos back then and there wouldn't  have been, even if they existed back then. The lived experience of people  confronting our policies and our resolve is what makes the difference. 

 Journalist: Just in regards to Nauru, do we know how many pregnant women are on  Nauru and what are the facilities like for giving birth and support services there? 

 Scott Morrison: I'm happy to give you some breakdown of what the facilities are  like. We don't go into the commentary on the individual numbers of people and the  breakdown, but I can tell you - if you just bear with me - there are two delivery beds  - I've visited the maternity wing on several occasions when I've been to Nauru.  There are two delivery beds, six post natal beds and a special care baby unit. The  hospital has the capacity to perform caesarean sections and other surgical  interventions and has pain relief options available to it. There are currently nine  midwives who are supported by a senior medical officer and a general paediatrician  supports neonatal care. 

 I should also stress that around 360 babies are born every year in that hospital and  the midwives are probably the most experience you've probably found working under  those conditions. So on top of that there is also the support provided by IHMS who  constantly monitor anyone's condition who may find themselves in that situation, but  I need to stress there are no exceptions to offshore processing. Offshore processing  is an effective policy when it's applied universally, when people are sent there  quickly, when there are the measures in place to ensure people are facilitated for  removing. 

 That's what offshore processing is. It's just not having a camp on an island. 

 Journalist: Mr Negus, are you able to provide any more details about this arrest  warrant that has been issued? Is that - can you identify the individual or can you  identify the allegations that are at their door? 

 Tony Negus: Look, no, I can't. Suffice to the say the arrest warrant has been issued.  There's a significant process that is undertaken to gather sufficient evidence to  convince the court to issue the equivalent of an arrest warrant in Indonesia. I  wouldn't want to telegraph the identity of that person because he is now being  sought by Indonesian police throughout the region. So we're confident we have a  good lead on this individual, but he is a significant smuggler in his own right. 

 Journalist: Is he an Australian? 

 Tony Negus: No he's not but I wouldn't want to go any further into his identity in that  context. 

 Journalist: Maybe you could tell us about your disruption techniques in the last  couple of - few weeks. What's different since 8 September to what you used to do? 

 Tony Negus: Look, consistent with what the Minister said, we really can't divulge  what our techniques are. Again, we're telegraphing our punches to the people  smugglers. Suffice to say that we've doubled the number of people in Indonesia.  AFP offices in that location are now working every day with their colleagues, their  Indonesian counterparts, providing support, providing intelligence, and providing  operational expertise in the context of how these operations should be run. And I've  got to say that the Indonesians are stepping up to the plate and doing a very good  job. I should stress- 

 Scott Morrison: -In answer to your question, one of the things that has changed is  the level of funding support that we're working through to ensure that the federal  police and other agencies that are working in the region have the resources they  need to do this job and don't have to beg, borrow and steal from other parts of their  budget to try and maintain their presence in the region, as was previously the case.  So they are getting the support they need, they are getting everything they need and  we're going continually through the process of ensuring that they can be equipped  and resourced to do the job. 

 Journalist: Just one more question. So you're getting more funding. Does that mean  there will be a return to the days where you payed informants in Indonesia to tell you  what was going on or [indistinct]? 

 Tony Negus: Look, the use of human sources or informants, as you call them, is a  common practise of policing worldwide. So we'll continue to use that where it's  appropriate. 

 Journalist: But will you pay them? 

 Tony Negus: Where it's appropriate, we'll continue to use them and we use the  techniques which are available and transparent under our own legislation and our  rules. 

 Journalist: Will that be transparent? Will you put the amount of money that you pay  informants into your annual report? 

 Tony Negus: No, look, each police agency, and this happens around the world,  have protocols in place, very strong protocols I might say, to manage that issue, to  make sure it's done properly and appropriately and properly recorded in a way that  can be looked at later on if there are issues that come up. So we will continue to do  that as we have done over many years. 

 Journalist: And will that be public? 

 Tony Negus: No it won't be, because you can imagine the amount of interventions  and involvement with informants. If they start becoming public, those resources dry  up very quickly. 

 Journalist: Commissioner, the 550 people you mentioned earlier have been  stopped from getting on boats to come here, were they all from camps or were they  from various areas? 

 Tony Negus: Look, a mixture - and this is done by the Indonesian National Police, I  might add - but those people go into care of immigration in Indonesia and the IOM.  So again, they were stopped in preparation from getting onto boats and people have  been arrested who were facilitating those boats at that time. 

 Journalist: In regards to transit ports of the Indonesians, have you had discussions  there? Where's all that up to? 

 Scott Morrison: Look, as I said last week, we have never made any announcement  about transit ports in Indonesia, that's an assumption the media have made. The  government has made no such statement at any time. So the premise of the  question I suppose falls as way. 

 Journalist: Mr Morrison, can I ask you about the practice of withholding visas from  detainees who commit offences while in detention. How serious should an offence  be before someone's visa is cancelled or refused and should such factors as mental  health be taken into consideration when considering why people offend while in  detention? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, that frankly sits outside of Operation Sovereign Borders but  I'm happy to respond to it. As you know, the new government has taken a very  strong position on those who have been charged with what can be quite serious  offences. We've got charges for murder; we've got charges for assault, for rape, for  interference with children. They all get taken back into detention immediately under  our policies where we are advised that such charges are being laid by the police and  the working relationship we have with the state police is improving by the day and I  will be meeting with commissioners on Monday to continue to progress that purpose. 

 The character test under the act is very clear about what the powers are to cancel  visas under section 501. There are criminal conduct provisions in the act specifically  and that also deals with offences committed while in detention or while someone  may have absconded from detention and that just requires a custodial sentence. So- 

 Journalist: -So you wouldn't accept that for someone who is on a good behaviour  bond? You wouldn't [indistinct] that? 

 Scott Morrison: If people commit crimes who are on visas, they should expect a  very strong message from me as minister and from this government in terms of how  we look at their continued presence in Australia. I have a very low tolerance for those  who commit crimes who are on visas. If people are on a visa, they are here at the  courtesy of the Australian Government and the Australian people. If they want to  breach that courtesy, then they shouldn't expect a response which is favourable. 

 Journalist: Sorry, Minister, people who are - have committed, not people who are  alleged to have committed- 

 Scott Morrison: -Well, there is also a general character test under the act and there  are a range of other provisions that go to the character test and each case is  assessed on its merits and that's the duty I have as a minister, but I think the general  principle should be well understood. But if we could take it back to OSB matters  because that relates to people already here, on any form of visa for that matter. 

 Journalist: Do you have any interest in re-introducing mandatory sentencing for  individuals who are found to have crewed boats to Australia. 

 Scott Morrison: Well, those provisions exist. 

 Journalist: But they're not being implemented at the moment. 

 Scott Morrison: Well, the sentencing provisions exist and they have been upheld by  the High Court. I will leave it to the Attorney-General to make comments on the case  more specifically, but the court found - the court finding made it quite clear that the  validity of minimum mandatory sentencing is quite valid under the act and so that  remains the law of this country and people should not expect that they would  somehow be immune from those laws under a Coalition Government. 

 Journalist: Just a question [indistinct]. Did you have to place an expenses  [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: There was an inadvertent claim that was made which has been  rectified. 

 Journalist: Can you give any more detail on that? 

 Scott Morrison: I can tell you there was an inadvertent claim, that it was made, and  it has been rectified. 

 Journalist: Was it [indistinct] travel in 2011? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes. 

 Journalist: And how much? 

 Scott Morrison: It was a pay back of $354. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] High Court's decision. What's your reaction to that? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, again I will leave that to the Attorney-General to provide a  specific response on behalf of the government if he chooses to, but we welcome the  fact that those laws which provide minimum mandatory sentences for those who  break our laws on people smuggling remain lawful and remain valid and if people  seek to break those laws, then they should expect to face the consequences of  those penalties. 

 Journalist: Air Marshal, I'm sorry, [indistinct] there were five arrests by the  [indistinct]. Where they in Lebanon? It sounds like a stupid question [indistinct] 

 Mark Binskin: No, that's okay. I'll hand over to my colleague, I think, for an idea of  the rest of the details. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] 

 Mark Binskin: No, I said it, but I'll hand over to the expert. 

 Tony Negus: Yes, they were. Those people have been arrested for questioning in  relation to the incident off West Java that the Air Marshal mentioned earlier. 

 Journalist: On information supplied by Australians? 

 Tony Negus: No, not necessarily. We are working with them to see were there are  any Australian links but they're working on their own and with Indonesian authorities  as well. 

 Journalist: Has the Abbott Government made any progress on developing  mandatory behaviour protocols for asylum seekers? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, again, that sits outside Operation Sovereign Borders but I can  tell you that we have been making progress on that. I made an announcement last  week - sorry, earlier this week about that and those protocols are in development for  consideration by the government. I'm still waiting to see those protocols come  forward, but that goes on the back of the decision we've already taken to provide  addresses of where people are to the police and that's in the process of being  actioned now. And in addition to that, there is the zero tolerance policy on those who  are charged with an offence to be immediately taken back into detention where we  are aware that such charges have been laid. 

 And that's where we're getting very good cooperation from police and I extend my  appreciation to all of the commissioners around the country who I will see on  Monday who have been very swift to try to put those procedures in place so we are  notified when things happen. 

 Journalist: Minister, you mentioned additional amount of funding for the Australian  Federal Police. Is that conditional to their current funding levels? In other words, are  you giving extra crash? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes. 

 Journalist: So this is over and above their normal operational requirements? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes, well, that process will be announced through the course of the  budget and other matters. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] 

 Scott Morrison: Not at this stage, no. What I am saying is, and we are still working  through some of those elements since the Operation Sovereign Borders began  which was only a few weeks, I should stress, but that is one of the things we've been  working through with the police and other agencies to ensure they're properly  resourced to do what we are asking them to do. 

 And their resourcing in these areas have withered under the previous government  and we need to restore that to restore the presence and frankly the support to those  who are doing what are very difficult jobs. And it is also very important in terms of our  relationship with Indonesia. The relationship between the AFP and Polri is a model  for all levels of cooperation and the Acting Commander might want to comment on  this because he has a lot of experience with the relationship at a defence level and  those two areas of cooperation is what we are seeking to bridge into a whole range  of other areas in the relationship with Indonesia. 

 Mark Binskin: The visit - I was very impressed. As you'd realise from my vice chief  job I have to lot to do in the relationship with Indonesia military to military which is a  good relationship, but I was very impressed yesterday talking with the Polri higher  command element and the relationship that obviously exists between the AFP and  the INP in Indonesia. It's a very, very good relationship. And that is across all the  task group, their relationship with their counterparts in Indonesia, is a good model to  go for and that's what we're going to achieve. 

 But across the board the cooperation at the moment with Indonesia is very good and  they're very positive towards working together as was outlined with Prime Minister  Abbott and President Yudhoyono's statement after their meeting a couple of weeks  ago. 

 Scott Morrison: We've got time for one or two more and then- 

 Journalist: -[Indistinct] and you spoke to the asylum seekers there, the refugees,  [indistinct]- 

 Scott Morrison: -Asylum seekers, yeah. 

 Journalist: Asylum seekers. They would not be coming to Australia. How did they  react? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, that's for them to- 

 Journalist: -No, I meant from your point of view, how did they react? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, they got the message. I was pleased to learn while I was  there that there are around 30 people who are already now in the process of looking  to go back from where they've come from, and from similar discussions I had, I  wouldn't call them discussions, I was there to deliver a message, not to get into a  debate, and from those other discussions on Manus Island there was a fairly big  spike in inquiries to the IOM about returning to their country. 

 We are - I made mention of this last week, we are working with the IOM right now to  increase their presence on both Nauru and Manus Island both in terms of the  number of people they have there to facilitate the request to return but also the back  office support and office accommodation and facilities support that they need to hold  those discussions with people looking to go home in a discreet location so they can  have those conversations in full confidence. 

 And the second part of that is to try and remove any obstacles or administrative  issues that would in any way slow down that process of return. Offshore processing  you know is working when people decide to go home. Remember, 30 per cent of  those who went through the Pacific solution last time decided to go home voluntarily,  and they're the sort of targets, if not higher, we're working towards. 

 Last question? 

 Journalist: Just in regards to - have there been any ore many cases of reports of  self-harm on either Manus or Nauru since beginning of Operation Sovereign? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, obviously I get reports on these things and they're matters  operational and for this reason - you won't hear this government giving oxygen to  that type of behaviour, because it runs the risk of endorsing that behaviour or  encouraging that behaviour. So that is not something you'll hear me discussing at  these briefings because it doesn't help those who are running the centres. 

 This is all about the operations of these place and how they can work best and it was  a good opportunity again to meet with the full cast of service providers up in Nauru  as I did on Manus, so we're talking about the Salvation Army, Save the Children, the  security agencies, security guard agencies, Leightons and others and providers and  to just work through the practical issues of making things work on the ground. 

 And the more they can just get on with their business of providing care and support  in those places, to work with the local host government in terms of the processing  arrangements which is run by the local host government, not by a Australia, that is  how we can best assist that process work well. But on that note can I particularly  thank Acting Commander Binskin for the work he's done in these two critical weeks  of the establishment of Operation Sovereign Borders. We're looking forward to the  return of Lieutenant General Campbell and we look forward to having him back on  deck as part of this program. So thank you very much Acting Commander. 

 You've provided a very steady hand in this operation in its early phases and we  really appreciate the work that you've done and working together. I'm sure that in  your other role there'll continue to be a lot of facilitation with the JATF. And  Commissioner Negus, thank you very much for being here with us here today. I hope  that also demonstrates the breadth of the coverage of this issue. 

 And let me finish on this one point and it was how Acting Commander Binskin  finished his remarks, and that's what this operation is all about. You were asking me  before about pregnant women, I can extend the same comment to children or  anyone else. The most dangerous place for a pregnant woman to be is on a boat  coming to Australia. That's the most dangerous place to be. The most dangerous 

 place for a child to be is on one of those boats coming to Australia. These measures,  these operations are about stopping that from happening. 

 Thank you.
