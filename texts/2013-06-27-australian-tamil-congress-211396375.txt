 Australian Tamil Congress   

 Documentary Released Revealing Strong Evidence of Sri Lankan War  Crimes   

 In January 2009 the Sri Lankan government launched the final offensive in a 26 year war  against the rebel forces of the Tamil Tigers or LTTE, who were fighting for an independent  Tamil state within Sri Lanka. In the final stages of the war, the Government of Sri Lanka  encouraged hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians to gather in “No Fire Zones”, where they  said they would be safe. Government forces then subjected these zones to sustained  shelling. Food queues, hospitals, and aid convoys were all attacked by the Sri Lankan military  and government officials denied adequate supplies of food and medicine to the trapped  civilians.    

 No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka is a feature documentary which follows the last  138 terrible days of this war. Both a film of record and a call to action - No Fire Zone is a  devastating expose of war crimes and crimes against humanity: the culmination of a three  year investigation which has seen its producers nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.   

 The Australia tour of this film started in Canberra on Monday this week, and will next be  screened in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.   

 The event has attracted many endorsers (full list: www.australiantamilcongress.com)   

 With Australia returning so many Tamil asylum seekers under the 'enhanced screening'  process despite stories of those returned enduring torture on return, and the Sri Lankan  Foreign Minister visiting Australia this week, the screening of this documentary comes as a  crucial time only months before Sri Lanka is to host CHOGM.    

 Documentary maker Callum Macrae is currently in Australia as part of the tour and will be  available for interviews.   

 To arrange for interviews please call 0433 428 967   

 Evening screenings and Q&A session with Callum Macrae:  Canberra: Monday 24 June   Sydney: Thursday 27 June, Saturday 29 June  Melbourne: Friday 28 June  Perth: Sunday 30 June
