 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Boats K135 and K136 arrive as Curtin  Detention Centre reopens   15/06/10  

 The reopening of the Curtin Detention Centre has been marked by the arrival of two  more illegal boats within 24 hours carrying 119 people, according to Shadow Minister  for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said.  

 Mr Morrison said “The arrival of these latest 2 boats, carrying 119 people  demonstrates why Kevin Rudd is spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars  re-opening detention centres closed by the Howard Government - his border  protection policies have failed.  

 "In 2010 we have had 68 boats carrying 3,354 people so far. That's more than three  per week. We have had seven boats carrying 336 people in just the last nine days,” he  said.  

 “The unprecedented rate of illegal boat arrivals has overwhelmed our detention  centres. 

 “In November 2007, there were just four people in detention who had arrived in  Australia illegally by boat. Today there are more than 3,300 illegal boat arrivals in  detention.  

 “Labor's border protection policies are also proving to be as inhumane as they are  ineffective.  

 “There is nothing humane about a policy that has attracted 6,389 people to get on 136  leaky boats, increasing the number of children being detained from just 21 to more  than 450 under Kevin Rudd's weak policies.  

 "Under Kevin Rudd the Curtin Detention Centre in remote Western Australia is now  re-open for business.  

 "Those being transferred to Curtin are being detained indefinitely under Kevin Rudd's  discriminatory asylum freeze. This is in stark conflict with the Government's stated  detention principles which prohibit indefinite detention.  

 “It's another example of Kevin Rudd being all talk and no action, when it comes to  principles he says he believes in.  

 “The only boats Kevin Rudd is stopping are those carrying minerals to our export  markets. He needs to spend more time focussing on the profits of people smugglers  than mining companies,” Mr Morrison said.  

 Mr Keenan said: “The influx of illegal boat arrivals has become so intense that the  Labor Party now is forced to announce two new arrivals in one press release.  

 “Yet Kevin Rudd recently told his caucus that the Labor Party doesn’t intend to do  anything to address the chaos on our borders.  

 "Only the Coalition has the resolve to acknowledge and address this crisis. 

 “The only way to ensure that Australia retains control of our immigration system and  closes down people smugglers is to change the Government,” he said.
