 TRANSCRIPT O F THE LEADER O F THE OPPOSITION  ALEXANDER DOWNER MP

 DOORSTOP PRESS CONFERENCE, Melbourne 3:00 pm

 Topics: Brian Howe/Govemment turmoil, Rwanda

 E  & OE:

 Downer: I want to obviously talk about the Deputy Prime Minister and, should I say, the  Deputy Prime Ministership. The turmoil in the Labor Party over leadership positions  simply means the Government is no longer governing. The process of government in  Australia is grinding to a halt because of turmoil over the leadership positions within the  Labor Party. The Deputy Prime Minister is desperately trying to hang on to his position.  Faceless men in the Labor Party are abusing and criticising the Deputy Prime Minister  for his performance and are obviously suggesting that the Deputy Prime Minister should  stand down from his position.

 Other Ministers are lining up for the position of the Deputy Prime Ministership. We  have the Minister for Foreign Affairs enthusiastically looking forward to a seat in the  Lower House and getting into a leadership position. The Minister for Finance wants to  change from his marginal seat of Swan to a safer Labor seat so that he can get in on the  leadership. Simon Crean the Minister for Employment Education and Training is hoping  against hope that one of the leadership positions will fall his way, and Dr Lawrence, the  former minister in the disgraced Western Australian Inc governments is enthusiastically  pushing her own prospects for a leadership position.

 The unseemly falling over within the Labor Party over the deputy leadership position is  simply a sign of things to come. The Labor Government is becoming increasingly  unstable, has lost any sense of direction. Mr Keating should bring his ministers into line  and bring the Labor Government back onto course. Mr Keating has disappeared into  the Lodge, not to be seen. He has nothing to say about these issues which are simply  making his Government totally directionless. Mr Keating should show some leadership  and come out and sort out the question of the deputy leadership of the Party. Mr  Keating should give either total support to Mr Howe as his Deputy Prime Minister or Mr  Keating should tell us who he wants to see in Mr Howe's position. He shouldn't leave  it to the faceless men of the Labor Party organisation.

 Journalist: .... (inaudible) ....Mr Howe being under siege would you say?

 Downer. Mr Howe's clearly under siege, and he's under siege from a whole range of his  colleagues. When Labor Ministers see Dr Lawrence stealing a march for the Deputy  Prime Ministership they'll want to make sure they catch up. Mr Beazley won’t be pleased

 to read in the newspapers that Dr Lawrence is the favourite for the deputy's position.  Mr Crean won't be pleased to know that Dr Lawrence is a favourite, and Senator Evans  will be disappointed to see that news. There's a lot of competition, between now and the  change in leadership positions in the Labor Party, to be fought out yet.

 Journalist: .... (inaudible) ....

 Downer: I don't think at the moment the public know who the Deputy Prime Minister  is because he's had a very low profile up until his sudden and unexpected attack on  government policy over the last week or so. But, it's obviously important that senior 

 positions within government are stable. A government can't govern if it is a divided  government and if all ministers are concentrating on are seizing leadership positions.  The fact is that in the present government, ministers are concentrating on grasping the  prizes of office rather than concentrating on the process of government. That's not good  for Australia.

 Journalist: You mention Mr C rean.... (inaudible).... a problem that doesn't really exist?

 Downer: I'm sure Mr Crean doesn't want to see Dr Lawrence take the deputy's position.  I'm sure Mr Crean has his eye on that position for himself. There's no doubt that a  range of ministers, including Mr Crean, are lining up for the deputy leadership of the  Labor Party. Many of them clearly believe that Mr Howe's time is coming to an end. A  faceless figure in the Labor Party organisation is apparently tapping Mr Howe on the  shoulder already. The fact is there is a queue now to the deputy leadership of the Labor 

 Party, and people like Mr Crean, Mr Beazley and Senator Evans are not going to just  stand idly by while Dr Lawrence claims the prize. I'm sure they'll be promoting their own  candidacy as furiously as they can. No doubt in the very short run it's in their interests  to prop up Mr Howe's position so that Dr Lawrence doesn't steal a march on them.  Expect them all to come out in total support of Mr Howe. Expect them behind the  scenes to be trying to get rid of him, but not letting Dr Lawrence in through the door.

 Journalist: .... (inaudible) ....

 Downer: I think Mr Howe has proved himself a man who, by coming out and attacking  government policy as the Deputy Prime Minister, is not somebody who should continue  to serve in the Government. There is a tradition of collective Cabinet solidarity where  ministers come out and criticise governments, the Prime Minister is required to take  action against those ministers. What's interesting in all of this is that the Prime Minister  is invisible. Why is the Prime Minister invisible through all of this? Why doesn't the  Prime Minister come out and give solid support to Mr Howe? But also reprimand Mr  Howe for breaking with Cabinet solidarity and making sure in future Mr Howe sticks by  the Cabinet rules. You wonder really the extent to which the Prime Minister wishes to  keep Mr Howe in that position.

 Journalist:.... (inaudible) ....

 Downer No I didn't ask Andrew Robb to pull Bronwyn Bishop into line at all. I've not  asked Andrew Robb to pull anybody into line. If anybody in my party ever needs to be

 pulled into line, as you put it, well then naturally I would regard that as my responsibility.  I wouldn't delegate those responsibilities to anybody else.

 Journalist: .... (inaudible) ....

 Mr Downer: I was just going to say something about that.

 Journalist: How do you feel about the am ount.... (inaudible) ....

 Mr Downer: Well, not a lot of money is being provided to Rwanda, and I think we're  all absolutely horrified at what we're seeing going on in Rwanda. I welcome the fact that  the Government is apparently planning to send a military field hospital to Rwanda. But  the question is whether the Government's priority is right in having a military field  hospital to serve the United Nations based in Kigali. It seems to me that the priority in  Rwanda is the plight of the refugees on the Rwanda/Zairian border and that Australia  should be making its resources as available as possible to assist those people. The  Australian Defence Force has some capacity to provide assistance to those people;  transport to help with the transportation of foodstuffs and medical supplies; medical  specialists and field hospitals that can be used to assist those people. The Australian  Defence Force has the capacity to distil water, and generate electricity. Those sort of  capabilities should be made available to the refugees and others who are suffering so  bitterly in Rwanda, rather than the focus of our effort being just to provide a field  hospital to United Nations troops.

 Journalist: .... (inaudible) ....

 Mr Downer: The Government appears to have chopped and changed its mind over this  issue. Though to be fair, you have to make judgements about when you send assistance  on the basis of circumstances and circumstances have changed somewhat. But the  Government has certainly been somewhat hesitant over this issue of providing assistance  to Rwanda. We will provide support for the Government giving assistance including the  assistance of the field hospital, but I've made the point. I think there are other areas  where we could provide greater assistance and I think the Government should look at 

 providing assistance to those who are suffering the most in Rwanda, rather than just  providing assistance to United Nations forces, valuable as that may be.

 Journalist: .... (inaudible) ....

 Mr Downer: Perhaps something in the vicinity of half of what Australians have provided  through voluntary organisations and, I'd have to say, I think the Government should keep  this constantly under review. It's not just the amount of money you provide, it's how that  money's spent and who gets the assistance, but I think all Australians feel that we should 

 be generous in the support we give to the people of Rwanda who are simply being  destroyed by events in that country.

 Journalist: So, should the Government give more money?

 M r Downer: There may be a case for - as time goes on - to provide more money. But  as I say, that's a judgement that will have to be made in the context of how the money  would be spent, and what sort of assistance is needed. As I've said, I think one of the  ways other than just spending money, and I'm certainly supporting the expenditure of  money, and perhaps there's a case for more money to be spent in time. There probably  will be. But, I do think we can provide a lot of practical assistance through the  Australian Defence Force and I think it's important that the Australian Government  focuses on that. I think more imagination should be used by Senator Ray and the  Government to ensure that the Australian Defence Force is used to the best effect for  the people suffering the most in Rwanda.
