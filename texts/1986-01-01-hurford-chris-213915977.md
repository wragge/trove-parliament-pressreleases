 A study of the attitudes of Australians and  recently arrived migrants from Asia and the  Middle East, in close neighbourhoods in  Sydney and Adelaide

 Volume 1

 Summary Findings

 Australian Government Publishing Service  Canberra 1986

 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

 1.0 Survey Population .

 . Interviews were conducted with 555 Australian born respondents and 160 respondents who were born overseas . Of the 555 Australian born respondents 326 were in Sydney and 229 in Adelaide .

 . As well 423 Australian born respondents were male household heads; with the remainder being either female household heads or spouses . Of the 160 overseas born respondents, all but 11 were male

 household heads, with 135 coming from Asia and 25 from a Middle  Eastern country . Most of the Asian born respondents were from Vietnam

 . Interviews were conducted in the public and private housing

 sectors in both Sydney and Adelaide . Survey locations were selected in areas where there was a known concentration of Asian born and to a lesser degree,  Middle Eastern  born migrants . Australian born "respondents were selected for interview if they

 lived in the same block of . . .  low rise flats as of at least one

 recently arrived migrant neighbour from Asia or the Middle East;  or in detached housing areas, if they lived next door to, over the  .  road from or at the back of at least one such migrant family.

 2.0 Survey Objectives '

 . The main objective of the survey was to find out what neighbourly activity was taking place between Australian born and migrant  family neighbours at this close neighbourhood level; and what  attitudes such neighbours held toward each other generally

 . .  More specifically the study tried to find out what happened to

 levels of prejudice and tolerance between persons of such diverse  backgrounds when they lived cheek by jowl with each other at the  close neighbourhood level; and whether status factors were  important. .  .

 3.0 Main Findings and Issues of Main Concern

 . The study was concentrated in areas where there were high levels of unemployment among both Australian and overseas born

 respondents: - Australian born male household heads 32 per cent in Sydney  and 49 per cent in Adelaide unemployed; compared with 

 4.9 per cent in New South Wales and 4.6 per cent in South . ,  A.ustralia for married males of equivalent age range during  the survey period (June 1985) - Asian born household hfeads 26 per cent in Sydney and 53 per '  cent in Adelaide; compared with 21.5 per cent for Vietnamese

 born males in New South Wales and 45.4 per cent in South 

 Australia

 - Middle Eastern born household heads 64 per cent unemployed;  compared with 27.6 per cent o£ Lebanese born males in New .  South Wales in the study period. .

 Most Australian born respondents saw Asian migrants as very  industrious, hard working; and generally trying harder than  Australians: .

 - 77 per cent in Sydney and 71 per cent in Adelaide agreed, 

 strongly or otherwise that Asian migrants generally try  harder than Australians - 71 per cent in Sydney and 64 per cent in Adelaide similarly

 agreed that because Asians are very industrious they do well  at work and school.â  -

 There was no evidence of any ghetto formation mentality developing  among Asian migrant respondents. They were actively establishing  informal networks of friendship and mutual support among 

 themselves as well as actively reaching out into the Australian  community:

 - 94 per cent believed anyone could be a good neighbour

 regardless of where they came from â 

 - 92 per cent would be pleased to have an Australian born

 family as next door neighbours â 

 - 83 per cent believed they had a great deal to offer the

 Australian way of life - 80 per cent believed Asians are eager to make Australian

 friends.

 Even though at the time of interview 48 per cent of Australian  born respondents had no contact with an Asian migrant family (or  families) living in their close neighbourhood, there was no  evidence of concern about a migrant build-up; .

 - only two per cent complained about a migrant presence in 

 their close neighbourhood.

 Asian migrant families were beginning to participate with other  close neighbours in mutual support type of activities such as  giving or getting help or advice in emergencies, lending or  borrowing tools or small things, helping or getting help with odd 

 jobs and giving or getting car lifts;. - 62 per cent of Australian born respondents said they gave or  obtained "  help or advice in emergencies to or from close  neighbours generally; compared with 23 per cent of those in 

 contact with Asian migrant neighbours, giving similar  assistance to these migrant neighbours - 59 per cent lent or borrowed tools to or from close

 neighbours generally; compared with 19 per cent of those in  contact with an Asian migrant neighbour undertaking this activity with such a migrant neighbour.

 Much latent goodwill was evidenced among Australian born

 respondents toward Asian migrant close neighbours: - 64 per cent of those already in contact with Asian migrant

 close neighbours would be happy to give or get help or advice in emergencies . .

 49 per cent would give or get help with odd jobs  30 per cent would meet for tea, coffee or a beer. 60 per cent of those not currently in contact with Asian  migrant close neighbours would probably give or get help or 

 advice in emergencies from such migrant neighbours if  opportunity arose .

 - 32 per cent would give or accept a car lift .

 The goodwill identified among Australian born respondents was  reciprocated by Asian migrant close neighbours generally: .  .  .  _ - 66 per cent said they currently lent or borrowed tools or 

 small things with Australian born close neighbours - 56 per cent would be happy to meet for an occasional cup of 

 tea, coffee or a beer - 46 per cent would be happy to consider having an Australian  neighbour visit for a meal - 39 per cent gave or obtained help with odd jobs

 - only three per cent indicated they would not wish to engage  in some form of activity with an Australian born close 

 neighbour if opportunity arose.

 Levels of tolerance and acceptance of Asian migrants were 

 generally higher in Adelaide than in Sydney: - of Australian born respondents in close neighbourhoods with  Asian migrants, in Sydney 60 per cent currently had no 

 contact compared with 37 per cent in Adelaide - current contact in the home was more in evidence in Adelaide  than in Sydney. ’

 Such tolerance and acceptance patterns were generally reciprocated  by Asian migrant respondents with many indicating a strong desire  for greater participation; but more so in Adelaide than in Sydney: - about 30 per cent in Sydney compared with 66 per cent in

 Adelaide would be happy to invite Australian neighbours in  for a meal - about 14 per cent in Sydney compared with 74 per cent in

 Adelaide would be interested in participating in a barbegue.

 Private housing sector respondents were generally more tolerant  and accepting of Asian migrant neighbours than public housing  sector respondents.

 There was no conclusive evidence among owner/buyers that Asian  migrant neighbours affect property values. Only 36 per cent of those in contact with Asian migrant neighbours compared with 52  per cent of those not in contact believed the value of houses drop 

 significantly when Asians move into a neighbourhood.

 Issues of main concern to Australian born respondents were the  perceived way Asian migrant families share house, queue jump for  public housing and obtain generous Government handouts. Also some  concern over continuing Asian migration.

 Issues of main concern to Asian migrant respondents were the  perceptions that Australians do not understand what it is like to  be a political refugee; and do not appreciate how difficult it is

 not being able to speak english well. As well there was strong  resistance to any suggestion that Asians increase the level of  violence in the neighbourhoods in which they live.

 The small number of Middle Eastern born migrants surveyed were  largely being ignored by Australian born respondents. Nor was  there evidence of much interest on either side of changing the  situation: .  '

 - including any interest in developing mutual support type  contacts at the close neighbourhood level.

 Overall there was no clear evidence from the study to support the  theory that equal status factors break down stereotypes associated  with prejudice and intolerance. What did emerge were clear signs  at the close neighbourhood level that much importance was given to 

 expected patterns of behaviour amongst neighbours, regardless of  status or background. Asian migrants were acquiring the status of  good neighbours.
