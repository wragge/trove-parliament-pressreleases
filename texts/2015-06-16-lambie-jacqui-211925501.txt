 Independent Senator for Tasmania Jacqui Lambie has called on the Australian Foreign  Minister to make a speech to the UN calling for people smugglers to be treated like  International criminals and referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC.)  Senator Lambie told the Senate last night in a speech that:   

 “Australia, indeed the world must deal with people smugglers in a different manner.  People smugglers are international criminals, who should be taken before the I.C.C.  (International Criminal Court) and held to account for their human rights abuses and  crimes..   

 If we are going to pay money to any one - it should be to boost the resources and reach of  the International Criminal Court.   

 People smugglers, their accomplices - including government officials and politicians -  where ever they live in this world they should fear the I.C.C and the penalties that the I.C.C.  can impose on them.   

 If it’s found that the International Criminal Court doesn’t have the physical capability or the  legislative power to investigate, put on trial and put in jail - people smugglers…  … then its up to the countries of the United Nations to take action.   

 Australia should take the lead on this issue and restore our nation’s integrity.  Our Foreign Minister should make a speech to the UN calling for a policy of accountability  and justice for people smugglers. 

 She should not be part of a plan, which bribes with Australian cash, international criminals  who smuggle, murder, rape and abuse asylum seekers.”  Contact 0407 904 134
