 AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE TO PALESTINE 

 Australian support will continue to help the Palestinian people gain access to health, education,  housing and social services, the Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd announced today in Ramallah. 

 Australia will provide three years of predictable base funding of up to $18 million to the United  Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which helps  Palestinian refugees residing in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.  

 Mr Rudd said Australia has a long history of supporting the Palestinian people, and this  investment builds on the $88 million Australia has provided to UNRWA since 2000. At the  moment, Australia is the 10th largest contributor to UNRWA. 

 “Our support helped UNRWA send 470,000 Palestinian children to school, saw 4,200  health workers provide medical care in 134 centres, improved water and sanitation  facilities in 105 schools, and increased income generation and food security for over  50,000 Palestinians,” Mr Rudd said. 

 The increased support was announced following Mr Rudd’s meeting with Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas, Foreign Minister Riad Malki and UNRWA Commissioner-General Filippo Grandi.  

 The Australian Government will also be providing up to 50 post-graduate scholarships over the  next five years, to meet Palestinian priorities.  These scholarships are aimed at giving more  Palestinians the skills needed to run an effective future Palestinian state.   

 Australia has also agreed to provide $20 million this year to help the Palestinian Authority  through a World Bank Trust Fund.  

 This funding will help the Palestinian Authority continue to implement its Reform and  Development Plan which includes providing basic services such as schooling and health care.  

 “Australia is determined to help the Palestinian Authority lay strong foundations for a future  Palestinian state and build its infrastructure and economy,” said Mr Rudd.  

 “I have been pleased to see these activities on the ground and commend the Palestinian  Authority for the progress it has made”.
