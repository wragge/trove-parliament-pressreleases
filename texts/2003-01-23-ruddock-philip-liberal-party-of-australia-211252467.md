 First TPV Holders to Accept Package Return Home 

 MPS 5/2003 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous  Affairs, Philip Ruddock, confirmed today that the first Temporary  Protection Visa (TPV) holders to accept the Government's  reintegration package have returned from Australia to Afghanistan.  

 The two men arrived in Kabul late yesterday (Australian time) after  accepting a reintegration package for current Afghan TPV holders  volunteering to return home.  

 Representatives of the International Organization for Migration  (IOM) met the men on arrival. The Australian Government paid for  their international travel to Afghanistan. 

 The package, announced on 16 December 2002, includes A$2,000  for each adult or child (or up to A$10,000 per family unit comprising  husband, wife and dependent children). 

 'The reintegration package offer to TPV holders was prompted by  the success of similar arrangements for Afghans in the offshore  processing centres and those who sought asylum here in Australia  but had not been granted a TPV,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 'It is a generous package, designed to give Afghans real choices  about their options upon arrival in Afghanistan. It has been  estimated to be worth up to five years' annual income for the  average Afghan.' 

 The package will be available to current Afghan TPV holders until 30  June 2003. Those not taking up the offer before the cut-off date will  lose the opportunity to accept the package. 

 'This enables people to return home in safety and with dignity to  help in the rebuilding of Afghanistan,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 'On arrival in Kabul returning Afghans will be provided with a range  of support services by the IOM, including counselling and assistance  with travel arrangements for those seeking to return to their home  towns and villages.' 

 To date 42 Afghans in onshore facilities and 274 Afghans on Nauru  have taken advantage of the reintegration assistance package from  the Australian Government and have returned home.
