  Friday 30 August 2002  Mural Hall, Parliament House  Doorstop  Iraq, Abu Quassey, death of Asylum seeker in Nauru, Bogainville. 

  Dick Cheney has toughened up his rhetoric on the question of Iraq, saying  there’s no doubt Saddam Hussein is stock-piling weapons of mass destruction.  Is that a view you share? 

  Yes, we’ve said all along that the real concern we have about Iraq is not just  the history of the regime but the fact that United Nations inspectors have not  been able to go into Iraq since 1998. That there’s no doubt that Iraq has some  chemical and biological weapons capabilities. There is an argument about the  extent to which Iraq might even be developing an embryonic nuclear  capability, there is much debate about that, the evidence is less clear. This goes  to the very heart of the problem. Iraq is in breach of nine separate United  Nations Security Council resolutions and the important thing is that the 

  international community do everything they can to get Iraq to adhere to its  international obligations. That is to allow in United Nations weapons  inspectors and to allow for the destruction of their weapons of mass destruction  capability. 

  Mr Downer would Australia support a US led attack? 

  Well we’ve said all along that the answer to that question is two-fold. And we  have said this for months and months and we have not varied this. And that is  that first of all the United States has not made any decision to attack Iraq and  they’re obviously hoping diplomacy can succeed. And we certainly hope it 

  can. But if the United States decides in the end and perhaps the international  community more broadly decides in the end that there is unfortunately no  alternative, any involvement by Australia would be subject to a request from  the United States for Australia to participate. And a decision by the 

  Government that we would participate as you know we would obviously have  to weigh up the situation at the time should such a request come. And so far  the United States has not made a decision to attack Iraq and ipso facto we  haven’t had a request to join in an attack which hasn’t been decided on. 

  Dick Cheney has also indicated that a resumption of weapons inspections  won’t be enough to avert the possibility of a strike. Do you share that view?

  Downer: Well I think this gets to the heart of a matter of judgement and the American  judgement is that the regime of Saddam Hussein will in no circumstances ever  allow the inspectors back in. We haven’t formed the opinion that in no  circumstances will they allow the inspectors back in and for the destruction of 

  weapons of mass destruction capabilities. We think that the international  community has to continue to do everything it can to try to persuade Saddam  Hussein and his regime to allow the inspectors in and for the destruction of  weapons of mass destruction. It remains to be seen in our view whether both 

  the threat by the United States that it could take military action, coupled with  the very strong demands from the international community that Iraq adheres to  its international obligations, will lead to the return of inspectors and the  destruction of weapons of mass destruction. We’ll just have to wait and see. 

  Journalist: France and Britain are urging restraint on the question of Iraq, is this an issue? 

  Downer: If I may say so, I’m a great fan of the media beause you know I read it and  listen to it and watch it just about every day of my life. There is interpretation,  re-interpretation, under interpretation and over interpretation of the comments  people make. I think Britain’s position has been pretty consistently similar to  our position. And if not identical, it’s been pretty close to identical to our  position. France’s position is a position based more on the question of timing  and how this issue is going to evolve. Our position has been entirely  consistent all the way through. We are not today the 30th of August, changing  our position. Our position remains the same as it was before Vice President 

  Cheney’s speech and it will remain the same until circumstances for some  reason or another go through a period of dramatic change. Dramatic change  would mean either, and of course this is the more hopeful if not necessarily  more likely, but certainly the more hopeful outcome and that is Iraq will fulfil  its international obligations and allow the inspectors back in and the  destruction of weapons of mass destruction. If Iraq continues to refuse to do  that well then circumstances could change for the worst. 

  Journalist: And how consistent do you think the United States position has been on this  issue? 

  Downer: I think you know this comes back, I mean it’s not right is it to blame the  media. I don’t think its fair to do that but I think there is a lot of over  interpretation sometimes and under interpretation at other times of statements  made by spokespeople in the United States, from the President downwards. 

  But you’ve got to remember something and that is that this is August, albeit  the end of August, and this is the holiday month in the United States, like  January in Australia and so a lot of the principal players on this issue are away  on holiday. As you can see the President is often filmed on holiday in his  ranch in Texas and the like and you know I think you’ll see a more consistent 

  pattern in the next month from the United States.

  Journalist: How hopeful do you think you can be that Saddam Hussein’s regime can be  toppled given the 1991 Gulf War and the outcome of that? 

  Downer: Let’s just hope that, one has to be more analytical than just being hopeful but  let us hope that Saddam Hussein’s regime understands the gravity of the  current situation and that is that Iraq should fulfil its obligations under the  Security Council resolutions and it should allow the inspectors in, it should  allow for the destruction of weapons of mass destruction capability and then  this point of tension will obviously substantially diminish. And it’s important 

  the international community sends a very strong message to Saddam Hussein  and his regime that they must adhere to these international obligations. I think  whatever different people around the world are saying at the moment there is  pretty much a view that the worst way to deal with this is to shrug one’s  shoulders and to say it doesn’t really matter anymore, we’re going to go and  focus on some other issue entirely we’re not going to worry about Iraq  anymore. I don’t think the world is saying that to Saddam Hussein. I think its  important Saddam Hussein understands that. 

  Journalist: Abu Quassey, are you disappointed that he didn’t even face people smuggling  charges? 

  Downer: Well as you know in Indonesia people smuggling is not a criminal offence and  it’s an issue that was discussed during the Bali People Smuggling Summit and  the Indonesian authorities are now in the process of drafting legislation to be  presented to the Parliament to make people smuggling a criminal offence. But  at the moment, it hasn’t been up until now a criminal offence so that obviously 

  isn’t news to us. Abu Quassey though has been apprehended, is now before  the courts. It’ll be a matter ultimately not for the prosecutor but for the judge to  determine if Abu Quassey is convicted and what sort of sentence he should  serve as a result of that conviction. I don’t want to get into making too many 

  more comments about Abu Quassey because obviously we don’t want to  prejudice the trial in any way. But I would say that we are delighted that at  least he has been detained and charged according to Indonesian law. This is a  man who allegedly has had substantial involvement with people smuggling  activities, including being responsible for the sending of the boat which sank  when many lives were lost during October or November of last year and it’s a 

  good development that he’s been charged. 

  Journalist: Would you have liked to have seen him extradited and also when will that  Indonesian legislation be in place? 

  Downer: I don’t know when it will be in place but I do know that the Indonesian  authorities are drafting the legislation. Obviously we would like to be able to  take action ourselves against somebody like Abu Quassey who on the face of it  could be brought to court in Australia. But he is before the courts in Indonesia 

  and I don’t want to add to much to that.

  Journalist: Is there any hope that he could be brought to trial in Australia? 

  Downer: Well let’s just see what happens in Indonesia. 

  Journalist: The asylum seeker who died a couple of days ago in Nauru three or four days  ago. What is the Australian Government doing about that? I understand there  are concerns about getting his body back to Kabul. That at the moment he’s  just being stored in a morgue in Nauru. 

  Downer: Well I understand that officials are working on how to handle this and well  obviously the asylum seeker died in Nauru and therefore the primary legal  responsibility for him is with Nauru, not with Australia. But Australian  officials are there and of course have been involved in this whole exercise and  we and the Nauruan authorities are working together to see what the best 

  arrangements could be. 

  Journalist: What’s the problem with getting his body back to Kabul? His family are keen  to have him home for a Muslim burial. 

  Downer: I’m not sure there are any particular problems although the logistical  challenges to get from Nauru to Kabul is not an easy journey but I’m not  familiar with there being any particular problems but I understand officials are  looking at how best to handle this. 

  Journalist: Would the Australian Government consider paying for it given they’re putting  $2,000 towards (inaudible). 

  Downer: I don’t think I’d put it that way. Look we need to work through what the best  thing to do is. I don’t want publicly to commit us to anything today because  the officials are still working on it and Mr Ruddock in particular but also I will  get some advice from officials and once they’ve worked through a lot of the 

  issues, and we’ll see what the best thing to do is. Obviously we need to be  sensitive to the asylum seeker’s family. 

  Journalist: Will the Bougainville Peace Agreement be a lasting one do you think  Minister? 

  Downer: Yes I do. I’ll be bold enough to say that despite the fact that it’s not complete,  but never the less the atmosphere in Bougainville is such that it will be a  lasting peace agreement. I’m very optimistic about that. I think it’s been a  wonderful achievement not just by successive Papua New Guinean 

  Governments, but by Australia and New Zealand who made this Bougainville  Peace Agreement possible. The war in Bougainville was the bloodiest war in  the South Pacific since the end of the Second World War. Many more people  died in Bougainville than have died in Northern Ireland. And it may not have  been on television every night in the way that Northern Ireland has been but 

  it’s been in our region and we and the New Zealanders made a massive

  contribution and are continuing to do so to the peace process in Bougainville  and we still have the peace monitoring group there. The weapons disposal has  been moving ahead. It hasn’t moved ahead though yet to conclusion.  Completion of weapons disposal is still ahead of us. But we are continuing to  work on the weapons disposal which up until now has been significant.
