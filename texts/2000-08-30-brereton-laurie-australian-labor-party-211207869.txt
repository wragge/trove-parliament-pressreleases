  LAURIE BRERETON MP 

  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

  126100 30 August 2000 

  EAST TIMOR: FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF POPULAR CONSULTATION 

  The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs Laurie Brereton today paid tribute to the courage   and resilience of the East Timorese people and1 their long and difficult struggle for 

  independence. 

  “A year ago today the East Timorese resisted violence and intimidation to vote decisively   for a free East Timor,” Mr Brereton 

  said. 

  “It is a privilege to visit Dili again to attend the first anniversary of the Popular 

  Consultation.” 

  “An independent and sovereign East Timor is now a year closer to realisation and likely   to come into being within little more than sixteen months.” 

  “East Timor still faces daunting challenges. The enormous destruction which followed   the ballot remains all to evident.” 

  “Australia is duty bound to do all that we can to assist the East Timorese as they build   their independent future.” 

  “Tragically, a year on from the ballot, more than 100,000 refugees remain in camps in   West Timor, still subject to militia intimidation.” 

  “Militia activity along the border and inside East Timor remains a matter of serious 

  concern. The Indonesian military must ensure that these violent incursions across the   border cease and that the militias are disarmed and disbanded without further delay.”
