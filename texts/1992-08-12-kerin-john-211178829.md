 Urgent relief for Somalia

 Australia will provide urgent relief assistance worth $3.5 million for people affected by drought and conflict in Somalia, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 "The situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate. Malnutrition is rife. The lives of one and a half million people are at risk, with hundreds of children dying daily," Mr Kern said.

 "Close to one million refugees have fled Somalia and are relying on assistance from neighbouring countries.

 "United Nations Observers are already in place and the UN stands ready to deploy security personnel in Somalia to facilitate the large scale distribution of humanitarian assistance. Such a force will need the cooperation of the various factions in Somalia.

 "The relief package includes Australian food aid worth $2 million and cash grants for the work of international agencies and Australian non government organisations."

 The grants have been allocated as follows: â¢ $2 minion to CARE Australia for an emergency food aid package (including approximately 4,000 tonnes of Australian wheat) for Mogadishu and surrounding areas â¢ $400,000 to UNICEF Australia for health, water and sanitation and agricultural assistance

 for 40,000 people in the Kismayo region â¢ $400,000 to World Vision Australia to assist 380,000 people in Mogadishu and the Lower Juba region. Program includes wet feeding, basic medical care, seeds and tools and training of community health workers
