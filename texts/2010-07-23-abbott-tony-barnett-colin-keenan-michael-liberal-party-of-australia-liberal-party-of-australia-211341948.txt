 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MR MICHAEL KEENAN MHR  SHADOW MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CUSTOMS  THE HON. COLIN BARNETT  

 PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA  

 

 

 Subjects: Coalition strengthens border protection, Rudd/Gillard Government’s failed border protection;  Julia Gillard’s Citizens Assembly and climate policy.   

 E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..   

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, well look, what I’m going to do is say a little bit about today’s policy announcement and then I’ll ask  Premier Barnett to speak, I’ll ask the Shadow Minister to speak and obviously, it’s great to be here in Perth,  it’s great to be with Michael Keenan, my friend and colleague, the Shadow Minister for Customs. It’s great  to be here with Premier Colin Barnett, who is running a really good government here in Western Australia, a  government that the eastern states, I think, increasingly envy. It’s also good to be here with Matt Taylor, our  candidate for Fremantle, who is a grassroots candidate, who is working very hard to give the people of  Fremantle better representation. Border security is incredibly important for the future of our country. Border  security obviously involves trying to ensure that we don’t have illegal boat arrivals, but it also involves  importantly vigilance at our ports, our sea ports and our airports to guard against the entry of illicit drugs and  also plant and animal diseases. Unfortunately, the current government, the Rudd/Gillard Government has  reduced funding for border security screening by some $58 million. What this means is that our sea cargo  screening is down by 25 percent on targets and our air cargo screening is down by 75 percent on targets. An  incoming Coalition Government will restore that $58 million, we will add $35 million. This is a $93 million  boost to cargo screening, it’s a $93 million boost to border security. As a result of this additional money, we  should get a further 52,000 cargo containers screened, we should get an additional $7.5 million air cargos  screened. This is a further demonstration of the Coalition’s border security credentials. You can trust the  Coalition with border security, you can’t trust Labor with border security. If you want better border security,  you’ve got to change the government. So I’ll ask Premier Barnett to say a few words and then I’ll throw to  Michael Keenan.    

 COLIN BARNETT:   

 Thank you Tony. I’m delighted to welcome Tony Abbott to Western Australia and to bring the national, the  federal campaign to our state. And welcome to my electorate, Tony. This is actually the Cottesloe electorate  in Fremantle. I welcome the announcement that Tony Abbott’s made this morning because there’s no doubt  that issues of border security, whether it be illicit drugs, other banned substances, and indeed even asylum  seekers, Western Australia very much feels it is on the front line. We have a long and exposed coastline, we 

  2 

 have a state that is closest to the Asia Pacific region and so much trade is going both in and out of Western  Australia, so tighter measurers are absolutely necessary and I know Tony and I think everyone in the Liberal  Party is greatly concerned that Australia is in danger of losing control of its borders. It takes real  expenditure, a real commitment and the best science and technology to ensure that we retain and protect the  integrity of our national borders and particularly, Tony, your announcements today will be very welcome in  Western Australia and very welcome in a port like Fremantle, where 75 per cent of Western Australia’s  imports come in through Fremantle and Fremantle is Australia’s fourth most important container port. So  very welcome and I thank you for coming to the state and I wish you well in the election campaign.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Thank you so much, Colin, thank you. Michael, do you want to say something?    

 MICHAEL KEENAN:    

 This announcement today restores the funding that was slashed from the Customs and Border Protection  Agency, the money that they used to check air and sea cargo coming into Australia and it was reduced  significantly. By restoring the funding today and by increasing the funding, that means that ports like this,  the chances of us picking up contraband, whether that be illegal drugs or illegal weapons, are vastly  enhanced. What’s happened since Labor made these cuts to Customs and Border Protection, what’s  happened is the detection of drugs coming into Australia is now on a downward trend. We will reverse that  trend by reversing the cuts and adding increased funding to make sure that the Commonwealth Government  is doing everything it can to keep contraband off our streets.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, now, I might take questions on this subject and then I might say a few words about other subjects and  then we can take general questions. So are there any questions on this subject?    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, Julia Gillard says you and her are of like mind on border protection policy. Is that right?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, it’s completely wrong. She is against all of the fundamentals of our border protection policy. She is  against temporary protection visas. She is against turning boats around where it is safe to do so. And she is  against third country processing. Now, if she and I were of one mind, she would have, long ago, picked up  the phone to the President of Nauru, and if she’s serious about off-shore processing, she wouldn’t be  pursuing this fantasy of a detention centre in East Timor. She would pick up the phone to the President of  Nauru now.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott [inaudible].   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 There’s no doubt that the public trust the Coalition on border security because we have a good record. We  found a problem, created a solution, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, they’ve found a solution and they’ve  created a problem. Let’s never forget that under the Howard Government, we got three boats a year. Under  the Rudd/Gillard Government, we’ve had three boats a week and the problem is just getting worse and it  will continue to get worse until there’s a change of government. If you want to stop the boats, you’ve got to  change the government.

 QUESTION:   

 Will you reduce migration by 120,000 people? Is that formal policy?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, look, there is no doubt that immigration peaked at about 200,000 at the height of the boom, under John  Howard. Immigration has gone up to 300,000 under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Julia Gillard doesn’t  have a policy here. She just has a pose. She says she is conscious of population pressures, but she won’t do  anything to actually reduce them.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m just pointing out, I’m just pointing out the facts and the facts are that at the height of the economic  boom, when the demand for skilled labour was presumably at its maximum, we had a net overseas migration  of about 200,000. Through the global financial crisis and the associated downturn, this government has  increased  net overseas migration to 300,000. Now, an annual intake of 300,000 won’t give us 36 million by  2050, it will give us 43 million people by 2050. Julia Gillard says she’s against Kevin Rudd’s big Australia  but she is continuing Kevin Rudd’s big Australia immigration program.   

 QUESTION:   

 What will an Abbott Government do about that?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’ll have more to say on the subject of population and immigration in the next few days, but you can rest  assured that we will have a policy, not a pose.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, how does increasing security at a port like this stop asylum seekers arriving by boat?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, there are a number of different aspects to proper border security. Obviously, stopping the boats is  critical but illegal boats are not the only border security problem that we’ve got. We’ve got illicit drugs,  we’ve got plant and animal diseases, we’ve got all sorts of other potential criminal activity that needs to be  safeguarded against and that’s why you need a proper screening program. That’s what this extra $93 million  will do. It will give us the border screening security that we need.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, will your migration policy have a target number?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

  4 

 Look, we will have an announcement in the next few days and you will know exactly where we stand, but  what you won’t get from us is the kind of fakery and fudging that you’ve had from the Prime Minister.    

 QUESTION:   

 Why is it so critical to stop the asylum seeker boats? Don’t the asylum seekers account for only a minority  of migrants to Australia and aren’t you running just a big scare campaign on this issue?    

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I think that one of the interesting features of the Howard Government is that support for immigration  generally went up, as the Howard Government strengthened border security, stopping the boats strengthens  support for the immigration programme. It is quite, noteworthy, that support for our immigration programme  increased substantially for most of the life of the Howard Government because the Howard Government  made it clear that it was in control, that we were in charge, and I think that people support an immigration  programme that they think is under control, that the Australian Government is running. They don’t support  immigration when they think at least part of the programme, perhaps a small part but a significant part, has  been subcontracted out to people smugglers.   

 QUESTION:   

 Michael Chaney has said that both sides of politics are confusing boat people, the issue of boat people, with  population growth.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s very -    

 QUESTION:   

 Is that fair?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I have a lot of respect for Michael Chaney, obviously. I mean, he’s a really outstanding Australian, but I  think that when the Rudd/Gillard Government lost control of our borders, that played into a whole range of  issues, and it is important to get our borders under control. Because, I think as far as the general public are  concerned, border security and immigration issues tend to get lumped in together. Now, there’s been no  deliberate confusing of it from the Coalition. We have a clear policy to stop the boats. We have a clear  policy to stop the boats. We’ve already announced significant measures on population, such as the  establishment of a Productivity and Sustainability Commission, we’ll have more to say on this subject in the  next couple of days.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] immigration goes up when you stop the boats. Why then are you hinting that you’re going to cut  immigration and stop the boats?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I’m just making the point that under the Howard Government at the height of the boom immigration  peaked at about 200,000 a year. Under the Rudd/Gillard Government, not withstanding the global financial 

  5 

 crisis, and the associated economic slowdown here in Australia, immigration has been ramped up to  300,000. I’m just making that point.   

 QUESTION:   

 What do you say to people in regional Australia who are saying ‘well, asylum seekers are great for us  because we’re crying out for jobs,’ and there’s, you know, shortages there in terms of you cutting  immigration.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I’ll have more to say on some of these subjects later. But, you know, I think it’s very important to  ensure that we don’t think that immigration is necessarily a solution to all of our labour market problems,  and look, I understand -    

 QUESTION:   

 Well, what is the solution?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, as I said, I’ll have more to say on these subjects in coming days. And if we want to talk about climate  change, now, I’ll - Colin, do you have any further comment that you’d like to make having listened to the  questioning here?   

 COLIN BARNETT:   

 Only if [inaudible].   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Okay, alright, okay, well, look if I may make some more general observations now -   

 JOURNALIST:    

 We’ll just wait till that truck goes past please, Tony.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Yeah, sure, sure.    

 JOURNALIST:    

 And the plane.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I understand. Gee, I tell you it’s such a vibrant state -    

 COLIN BARNETT:   

 It’s all go here Tony. It’s all go!   

 TONY ABBOTT: 

  6 

 

 This is the noise of economic activity, isn’t it? Okay, look, the Prime Minister has today announced a  community consultation process on climate change policy. Let me be very clear - this is camouflage for the  coming climate tax. This is camouflage for the coming carbon tax. Julia Gillard has said repeatedly that she  wants to see a carbon price. Bob Brown has said that he wants a carbon tax. The Gillard-Brown secret Green  preference deal will give the Greens almost certainly control of the Senate. If the Government is returned, as  sure as night follows day, there will be a carbon tax. And that will mean much higher electricity prices, it  will mean pressure on jobs, and above all else it will mean pressure on families struggling with cost of living  increases. Now, it’s high time that the Prime Minister show some real leadership on this, not fudge the issue  until after the election. At the moment, you can’t tell whether she wants to be a strong leader, a real Prime  Minister, or just a debate moderator. It’s not good enough, and as things stand Julia Gillard looks very much  like the man she deposed, Kevin Rudd. Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd are fading into each other. Both of  them seem to be a lot of talk and not much action, at least this side of an election.   

 There are two other issues that I wouldn’t mind dealing with very quickly. It seems that the mid-cap miners  might be about to restart their advertising campaign. What this demonstrates is that Julia Gillard’s mining  tax fix is a fake. The mining tax fix is a fake. The mining tax remains a potent threat to the prosperity of  Australia, a potent threat to the prosperity of Western Australians in particular. What it will do is dry up  investment and jobs right around Australia, but particularly here in Western Australia. The only way to stop  the tax is to change the government, and quite frankly the only way to restore Australia’s international  reputation, which has been so damaged by this tax, is to punish the Government that was foolish enough to  try to introduce it.   

 Final point, we learn overnight from the new ABC 24 hour programme that the former Prime Minister was  utterly negligent in attending to his responsibilities as Prime Minister. He was absent from meetings of the  National Security Committee of Cabinet, he was absent from meetings of the Strategic Priorities Committee  of Cabinet. Julia Gillard needs to say is Kevin Rudd still fit to be a member of her Cabinet after the election.  I say he’s not, and I call on her to rule out this day any return to Cabinet for Kevin Rudd. She must rule it  out. If she won’t rule it out she’s just demonstrated that frankly amateurs are in charge of the Australian  Government. That this is not a grown-up Government. A Government whose Prime Minister is too busy to  attend a meeting of the National Security Committee of Cabinet is not a grown-up government.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] Julia Gillard that she didn’t call him on that, and make him change the way he ran those  meetings?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that Julia Gillard has to explain who actually chaired the meetings at which critical decisions were  taken. For instance, who was there when the mining tax decision was taken? Who was there when the  decision was taken to change our force structure in Afghanistan, for instance? If it wasn’t the Prime  Minister, the elected Prime Minister who was there, who was there? And who takes ultimate responsibility  for these decisions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, your thoughts on the Citizens’ Assembly and also part of your reasoning for delaying, or saying  there won’t be a carbon price, is that India and China wouldn’t do it. There are reports out of China that it  will in fact start up a trading scheme. Does that make your argument now null and void?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

  7 

 We already have a Citizens’ Assembly. It’s called a Parliament. This is a decision for the Parliament. And  she can’t sub-contract out leadership to some kind of giant focus group.   

 QUESTION:   

 The second part of that question though, China says it will start up a trading scheme, an emissions trading  scheme?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, there will be no carbon price on consumers. There will be no carbon tax under an incoming Coalition  government. We believe in direct action to bring emissions down. We’ve had a policy out there for months  now. We have a strong and effective climate change policy. It’s the Government that is faking things,  fudging things and ultimately trying to deceive people.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, is that a ‘never ever’ promise on a carbon tax? Will you never ever have a carbon tax? And also,  is Bruce Billson saying that you will now remove unfair dismissal for small businesses?  Is that the case?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Obviously, if the whole world changes, we will adjust. But I doubt very much that the whole world is going  to change on this issue anytime soon.   

 QUESTION:   

 But China is saying that they could consider an emissions trading scheme this decade. Things might change,  so where do you sit if China does move?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 As I said, if the whole world changes, we will adjust our position accordingly. But I doubt very much …   

 QUESTION:   

 So there could be a carbon tax under you?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 No. What I am saying is that if the whole world changes, we will adjust our position but the only person  who wants, the only person who wants a carbon tax is Julia Gillard, who won’t tell you about it, and Bob  Brown, who will tell you about it. Now, on the other question that you asked me, what we saw a week or so  back was a Government change in response to a recommendation from the independent umpire. And we  support that. Simple as that.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, looking at the debate on Sunday, are you already rehearsing for that with your advisers? Are you  nervous? And who are you more scared of, or what are you more scared of: Julia Gillard or the worm?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

  8 

 Well, look, the worm certainly doesn’t like Liberals. I mean, the worm has a long history of disliking  Liberals but look, I’ve got a pretty busy few days. I’m pretty busy here in Perth today. I’ve got some big  engagements tomorrow and I’m doing quite a bit on Sunday as well, quite apart from prepare for the debate,  so I’m doing my best but I’ve also got a lot of other important things to do between now and Sunday night.   

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible] …former boxer, can I get your opinion on the Danny Green fight and that punch that put him on  the canvas?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think all my punches were real knockouts. I didn’t see the fight. I’ve obviously seen a little bit of the  reportage today but I just think I’ll leave that to the relevant experts.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, just on the debate, if I could be self-indulgent for one second for our Ten News viewers who are  concerned about it clashing with Masterchef, do you have any suggestions for the two finalists for  Masterchef on how they can win it? Sorry, question from Sydney.   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Cook up a storm.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think you’ve won over any voters with your appearance on Hey Hey It’s Saturday! and when can we  expect you to do a serious political interview?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, what am I doing now? I mean, this is an extremely serious political interview by many, many people. I  had a fairly, well I had 15 minutes on 6PR this morning. I will be doing all sorts of interviews in all sorts of  different contexts over the course of this campaign.    

 QUESTION:   

 Have you spoken to John Howard about what role he might play in the campaign and will we see him  prominently throughout the campaign?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I certainly hope so because, unlike Julia Gillard, I’m happy to see former Coalition leaders active in the  campaign because I think that it’s good for democracy to see people out and about. But I speak to John  Howard quite a lot. You’d expect me to speak to John Howard quite a lot and my understanding is that he  will be helping a lot of local campaigns. I’m, I think that’s great that he’s doing so and certainly, if from  time to time, he wants to make wider interventions, I’ll be thrilled to hear them.   

 OK thank you.
