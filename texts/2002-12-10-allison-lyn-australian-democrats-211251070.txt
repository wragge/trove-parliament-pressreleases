 Senator Lyn Allison  Australian Democrats  Senator for Victoria 

 10 December 2002   MEDIA STATEMENT          02/595 

 

 Bracks urged to fight E Timorese deportation    

 The Victorian Government should join the Northern Territory Government in supporting its  East  Timorese  asylum  seekers  fighting  Federal  Government  deportation,  Australian   Democrats’ Victorian Senator, Lyn Allison, said today.   

 The  Northern  Territory  Assembly  yesterday  notified  the  Senate  of  its  motion  noting  a   groundswell  of  community  support  for  its  East  Timorese  residents  and  urging  favourable   consideration of their applications to stay in Darwin by the Federal Immigration Minister.   

 Senator  Allison  said,  “80%  of  East  Timorese  asylum  seekers  live  in  Victoria  and  the   Victorian Government should now offer its support for them to stay.”   

 Senator Allison said, “These people have friends and family in Victoria and some have lived  and worked here for over 10 years.  Many will be forced to return with children for whom  there is no school and, as the recent riot has demonstrated, few jobs and little social security  for the unemployed.”   

 At present there are about 1,650 East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia, of whom about  1,400 live in Victoria.  Most of these asylum seekers arrived in Australia soon after the Dili  Massacre in 1991, and have established themselves in Australia.  The Federal Government  is presently considering their cases for asylum.  If they are unsuccessful they will be forced  to return to East Timor.  Cases that have been heard to date have resulted in asylum seekers  being ordered to return.   

 “By pledging his Government’s support for these asylum seekers, Premier Bracks can send  a  message  to  the  Federal  Government  that  the  East  Timorese  are  welcome  in  Victoria,”   concluded Senator Allison.
