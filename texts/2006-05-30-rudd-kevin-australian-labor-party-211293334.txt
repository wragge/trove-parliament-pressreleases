 MEDIA RELEASE 

 KEVIN RUDD M.P.   Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and  International Security   

 

 DOORSTOP  INTERVIEW - PARLIAMENT HOUSE   

 30 MAY 2006   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:    Situation in East Timor; Newspoll; Mark Vaile’s leadership   

 

 RUDD:    In the last twelve hours or so I have spoken further to  Ministers in the East Timorese Government. There are grave concerns about the  extent to which we have enough fresh water and food to deal with the crisis  caused by people heading towards camps in Dili.  There is a large scale  humanitarian challenge which is becoming a crisis. Tim Costello from World  Vision says that and East Timorese Government Ministers have said the same to  me.   

 My challenge to the Government today is provide us with an assurance, and  provide the public with an assurance, that we have sufficient packaged water  and food to deal with the 30,000 or so people who are now seeking shelter in  camps.   

 This is an immediate challenge for Australia. East Timorese citizens are still  finding it unsafe to return to their homes. Therefore they must go to camps and  they must be feed. 

 

 The challenge for the Howard Government is to provide us, the public and the  East Timorese public with an assurance that a proper needs assessment has been  done, that there is sufficient forward positioned fresh water and food to deal  with this crisis and we would appreciate this assurance being made today.   

 REPORTER:  Brigadier Michael Slater actually disputes what Tim Costello  says - he says that everything is under control in East Timor. Do you think that  he is wrong?   

 RUDD:  As I understand it, the disagreement between Brigadier  Slater and Tim Costello concerns the physical security provided to individual  NGOs such as World Vision. I am in no position to make a judgement on that.  What I am in a position to make a judgement on is that there appears to be a  significant shortage of packaged water in these camps. World Vision says that,  other NGOs say that and East Timorese Government Ministers say that as well.   

 The critical challenge is ensuring that we have that challenge under control  because what we know from previous refugee crises is that if these things are  allowed to go on, problems of dehydration set in, problems of gastro intestinal  diseases and the most young and the most frail are the most vulnerable in these  circumstances.   

 REPORTER:  The East Timorese leadership will again meet today I  understand. What would you like to see come out of that?   

 RUDD:  We want East Timor to use its constitutional processes to  resolve the political impasse within the leadership. We are not in the business of  picking sides, we are not in the business of saying that one side is right and the  other side is wrong. What we want to ensure, however, is that the processes  involved in their constitution are used peacefully to resolve any dispute which  exists between them.   

 REPORTER:  Newspoll today shows that Labor is travelling quite well but  Kim Beazley is not travelling quite so well. Would a new leader be better for  Labor?   

 RUDD:  I think what is interesting about today’s polls is that the only  person that seems to be happy with Peter Costello’s Budget is Peter Costello. I  mean, what has happened over the past six months is that the Australian people  have seen the beginnings of the full impact of the industrial relations changes.  They don’t like that. They have seen Peter Costello’s Budget which short-changed them and they didn’t like that. And we have also seen a Government  who’s moral authority has been eroded by its involvement in the wheat for  weapons scandal and the Australian people don’t like that either.   

 Put all of that together and you have a Government that is starting to look pretty  tattered around the edges and I think that we are beginning to see evidence of  that in today’s polls.  

 

 REPORTER:  Would there be a better approval rating if the Opposition  Leader was K Rudd or J Gillard?   

 RUDD:   I think that Kim is doing fine as Leader and evidence of that  is the fact that the Party continues to do strongly in these polls and that is a trend  that has been underway for some time now and on the back of the leadership  which has been shown in these key areas of industrial relations and the rest.   

 REPORTER:  What if you had a more popular Leader in the top Chair?   

 RUDD:  I think that Kim is doing fine as the Leader of the Australian  Labor Party. He took over the leadership of the Party at a difficult time at the  beginning of last year, we all know that. He has provided strong and consistent  leadership and we are doing well as the alternative Government of Australia.   

 And when it comes to the question of leadership, can I just mention something  that is happening from the other side of politics, something from Queensland.  Mark Vaile is turning the Queensland National Party and the National Party  generally into a complete rolling joke. Mark Vaile as leader of the Nationals is  starting to look as useful as a jam sandwich to a drowning rabbit. It’s just getting  really silly. This is the bloke who couldn’t manage the AWB crisis, he can’t  manage the Queensland National Party - how long can he actually pretend to be 

 Deputy Prime Minister of Australia? It’s a joke.   Ends 30 May 2006.
