 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 7 July 2014   

 Morrison confirms illegal transfer of asylum seekers   

 “The government has now confirmed the illegal transfer of over 40 asylum seekers”,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The government has handed these people over to danger without properly assessing  their claims for protection.    

 “The Minister must now be upfront about the fate of the 153 asylum seekers, including  37 children, who are still missing.    

 “It has been over a week since these people have been ‘disappeared’, the government  must confirm whether they are being held in custody on board Australia’s ‘prison ships’.   

 “There is nothing legal about what the government is doing out on the high seas.    

 “Minister Morrison can continue to repeat his lies, it doesn’t make it true. What the  government is doing is illegal.    

 “The United Nations has confirmed that the government’s actions do not accord with our  legal obligations.    

 “The government continues to think that they can act above the law, this contempt will  be tested in the parliament when the new senate votes on a motion condemning their  actions out on the high seas.”
