 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 15 May 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/243

 Senate supports Democrat motion for a more humane refugee system and to close Woomera The Australian Democrats have welcomed the ALP’s support for the amendment to the Senate’s reply to the Governor General’s opening address to Parliament.

 The amendment, moved by Democrats’ Leader, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, called for ‘…a more humane and workable approach to asylum seekers’ and for the closure of Woomera.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “The ALP’s decision today to support the Australian Democrats’ amendment, sends a clear message to the Government that there is growing community and political concern over the treatment of asylum seekers, and that the Woomera Detention Centre should be closed immediately.”

 “The Opposition now needs to back this up with concrete action - and sooner rather than later.

 “The Australian Democrats hope today’s motion signals a positive change in Opposition policy. Labor’s past support for the Liberal Party’s refugee legislation and policy is a major reason why we have such an inhumane and ineffective approach to asylum seekers.

 “We are looking forward to working more closely with the Opposition to ensure that the Australian Government’s asylum seeker policies are compassionate and humane,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
