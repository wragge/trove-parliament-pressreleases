 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FOURTH BOAT IN TWO DAYS HIGHLIGHTS  LABOR’S CHAOTIC BORDER BREAKDOWN April 03, 2013

 The confirmation of another illegal boat arrival, with 53 people on board, just hours after two other boats were announced  is symptomatic of the chaos that our borders have descended into under this failed Labor Government, Shadow Minister  for Immigration, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 "Four boats and more than 250 people have arrived in just two days. Labor's stewardship of our borders has become so  chaotic that people smugglers are now sending boats to Australia every few hours a day," Mr Morrison said.

 "With just one in 20 illegal boat arrivals being sent to Nauru or Manus Island under Labor people smugglers are able to  continue to sell their product of passage to Australia and a permanent visa.

 "Record boat arrivals and record cost, chaos and failure on our borders will be the lasting shame of this failed Labor  Government," Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Three boats in 24 hours is just another day’s work under the Labor Government’s failed border  protection policies.

 “Just over a week ago there were 35,000 people that had arrived illegally by boat under Labor - now we have already had  well over 36,000 people.

 “The Gillard Government cannot hide from these figures that highlight the systematic failure of this Government to protect  Australia’s borders.

 “Only a change of Government is going to put an end to this constant flow of boat arrivals” Mr Keenan said.
