 Peter McGauran MP Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs

 

 Media Release 

 Khmer New Year

 12 April 2005

 More than 23,000 Australians of Khmer descent will encourage everyone to join them in their three days of New Year  celebrations, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran said today.

 The three day celebration is a period of reflection and renewal and a time of kindness and peace.

 The first day welcomes the new angels who will care for the world for the year, the second day is a day of offering gifts to  parents, grandparents and the elderly, and the third day signals the start of the new calendar year.

 ‘Cambodia-born Australians are involved in all major sectors of the Australian economy most notably agriculture,  manufacturing and small business and also feature regularly in the Australian arts community,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The fact that more than half of Australia’s Cambodia-born population arrived as refugees makes their contribution to our  country more remarkable.

 The vast majority of Khmer migrants have also shown dedication to their new home with more than 95 per cent taking the 

 important step of becoming Australian citizens. 

 I extend my best wishes to Australians of Khmer heritage as they celebrate their New Year.
