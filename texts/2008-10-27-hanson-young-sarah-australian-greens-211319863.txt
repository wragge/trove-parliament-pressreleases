 Sarah Hanson-Young   Greens Senator for South Australia

 Deaths of Afghans denied asylum 

 yet another reason for Royal Commission 

 

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has reiterated the need for a Royal  Commission into the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, after reports of  overseas executions of people denied asylum in Australia. 

 

 Documentary A Well-Founded Fear, due to air on SBS on November 19, reports that  up to 20 Afghan asylum seekers rejected by Australia under the Pacific Solution  scheme were then killed after returning to Afghanistan. 

 

 “Government policy isn’t just words on paper - these are people’s lives we are  talking about here,” said Senator Hanson-Young. 

 

 “The decisions made about immigration by the Howard Government have cost  people’s lives. 

 

 “Now the Rudd Government has the chance to demonstrate the understanding,  compassion and sense of justice that the Howard Government lacked so callously. 

 

 “Immigration Minister Evans must demand the establishment of a Royal Commission  into the way Australia’s immigration policies have treated asylum seekers, as a  matter of urgency. 

  “Only with the level of investigation and scrutiny a Royal Commission would bring  will we see a complete picture of the damage caused by Australia’s immigration  policies. 

 “The individuals who made these decisions must be held accountable, and we must  learn from the consequences, so that tragedies such as these can never, ever  happen again.” 

 Senator Hanson-Young said the Greens would be watching closely to ensure that  there is adequate transparency in new immigration processes under the Rudd  Government. 

 “We will be monitoring to make sure the necessary checks and balances are applied  to these crucial matters of human rights and justice,” she said. 

 

 “We must not simply turn a blind eye to this dark chapter in our history books.”
