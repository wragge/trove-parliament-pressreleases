 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services   

 New project boosts community harmony and  future Socceroo hopes  19 June 2010 

 The Australian Government will provide $135 000 in funding to Soccer Unites, a new project  to make SA soccer more inclusive, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and  Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, and the Member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas,  announced today. 

 ‘On the eve of Refugee Week and as the world embraces soccer fever, I am pleased to  launch a project that celebrates the special role of sport in helping to build community  harmony,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 ‘The Soccer Unites South Australia project will engage 10 000 participants and 110 clubs,  giving those involved a chance to inspire their fellow Australians. 

 ‘The project will allow a sharing of experiences and cultures and will help create common  ground among people of different backgrounds.’ 

 Mr Georganas said the project would build on the obvious importance of soccer to many  communities in Australia and all around the world, as demonstrated by the worldwide  interest in the World Cup in South Africa. 

 ‘Being part of a team and working together breaks down barriers and creates a welcoming  environment in which everyone can participate,’ Mr Georganas said. 

 ‘The Soccer Unites project is an exciting initiative that will help build social cohesion and  community harmony in South Australia. 

 ‘In addition, the program may also help to unearth a new generation of talented Socceroos.’ 

 Activities will include cultural awareness training for players, coaches, administrators,  parents and guardians and the pairing of members of new and emerging communities and  the broader soccer community. 

 The South Australian Amateur Soccer League will also invite relevant schools across South  Australia to join the local soccer competition, while soccer clinics will be offered to schools  without a local soccer competition to broaden the reach of the project into new areas.  

 The project will be staged over 18 months under the Diversity and Social Cohesion Program  to boost community cohesion through soccer in Australia.
