 Prime Minister of Australia 

 

 Media Release 

 Appointment of Australia's First Resident Ambassador to the Holy See 

 21 July 2008 

 The Australian Government will for the first time appoint a resident Ambassador to the Holy See. 

 The  Government  intends  to  recommend  to  the  Governor  General  that  the  Hon  Tim Fischer  AC,  former  Deputy  Prime   Minister of Australia, be appointed to the position. 

 The appointment will mark a significant deepening of Australia’s relations with the Vatican. It will allow Australia to expand  dialogue  with  the  Vatican  in  areas  including  human  rights,  political  and  religious  freedom,  food  security,  arms  control,   refugees and anti-people trafficking. 

 It will also provide an avenue for us to learn from each other’s perspectives on the Millennium Development Goals and  climate change. 

 The appointment of a resident Ambassador is also underpinned by Australia’s commitment to inter-faith dialogue. 

 The  Holy  See  has  expressed  support  for  Australia’s  efforts,  within  Australia and  in  the  region,  to  facilitate  greater  understanding between people of different faiths. 

 This  will  be  the  first  time  since  1973,  when  Prime  Minister  Gough  Whitlam established  diplomatic  relations  with  the   Vatican, that Australia has appointed a resident Ambassador. 

 It is intended that Mr Fischer will take up his appointment in early 2009.
