 NEW CUSTODY PROVISIONS FOR BOAT PEOPLE

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, today brought legislation before  Parliament on new custody provisions for boat people in  Australia.

 The provisions, which will prevent the release of boat  people from detention for a defined period of time, will  apply to those who have already arrived or who may arrive  before 1 December 1992 and whose claims have not yet been  determined.

 Mr Hand said today he was taking this exceptional step so  that all persons entering Australia without prior authority  would be subject to the same custody arrangements regardless  of the circumstances of their entry.

 "The legislation will apply equally to persons whose claims  to stay are already being processed and to those who may  arrive between now and 1 December," he said.

 "Under the proposed Bill, there will be no authority to  release these people into the Australian community.

 "However the period of custody up to the time an entry  decisions is taken will be of limited duration which will  impose time constraints on the processing steps taken by the  Government to make decisions on their claims to entry."

 Mr Hand emphasised that a boat person whose claims to remain  were rejected would be subject to removal from Australia.  Such people would continue to be held in custody pending  removal.

 The Minister said the Bill would be an interim measure  pending a comprehensive overhaul of immigration legislation  governing entry, custody and removal.

 "These new arrangements underpin the Government's  determination to process claims expeditiously," Mr Hand  said. ... /2

 "They also underline the fact that it will be in an  applicant’s own best interests to make sure that no undue  delay occurs on his or her part in lodging an application or  in submitting supporting evidence."
