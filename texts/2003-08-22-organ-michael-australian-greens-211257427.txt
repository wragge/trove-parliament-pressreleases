 ***** MEDIA RELEASE *****  22 August 2003   

 

 ASYLUM SEEKERS SHOULD BE GIVEN A SAFE HAVEN   

 Cunningham MP Michael Organ MP and Iraqi refugee  Hussein El Hashimi will launch the “Safe Haven” Quilt  in Wollongong Mall near the chessboard on Friday 29th  August at 2pm.    

 “We must act to protect the victims of persecution, we must provide a safe  haven to those who have suffered under brutal regimes, and we must afford  all vulnerable people the rights they are entitled to under International Human  Rights instruments. That’s the bottom line for a decent society”, Mr. Organ  said.     

 “The ‘Safe Haven’ Quilt, depicting messages of support for refugees, is one of  several made by detainees and their many supporters who seek community  processing for asylum seekers, closure of detention camps and no forced  repatriation, and I welcome the opportunity to launch it and support asylum  seekers who have sought safe haven in Australia”.   

 “The Quilt is a creative way that members of our community show their  commitment to the fundamental rights outlined in the 1948 Universal  Declaration of Human Rights”.    

 “The suffering that so many asylum seekers have endured is immense and  when they feel safety is within reach, we lock them away and treat them  harshly, deny them basic rights and blame them for their horrific  predicament”, Mr. Organ said.   

 (In the event of bad weather, the launch will be in the Hideaway CafÃ©.)
