  MINISTER PHILIP RUDDOCK

  PART TRANSCRIPT - PRESS 
CONFERENCE 9 APRIL 1999

  ARRANGEMENTS FOR KOSOVO 
TEMPORARY ENTRANTS

  

  The key elements of the plan are already in place.

  

  A selection of officials together with a representative of the United 
Nations High Co mmissioner for Refugees will leave Australia to 
be in place on Sunday to commence identifying those persons who can 
be best assisted by offering temporary asylum in Australia.

  

 The selection criteria which will determine persons 
to be included in the group of 4,000 will include the following. First, 
it will be for people who were forced to flee Kosovo since the 26 March 
this year. They will have to have voluntarily agreed to the evacuation 
to Australia. They have to be fit to travel and family units will be 
kept together as far as possible. Selections will be made with advice 
and cooperation of the UNHCR.

  

 It is planned the first plane load of displaced people 
will leave the region for Australia towards the end of next week. For 
that purpose the Government is chartering a 747 jet exclusively for 
that purpose over a number of weeks. The arrivals will be coming to 
Sydney and they will go initially to a reception facility at east Hills 
where they will undergo health screening, that is comprehensive health 
screening and receive orientation in relation tot here stay in Australia. 
Following that initial reception they will be moved to accommodation 
centres around Australia.

  

 Now I want to say something about that because there 
has been a great deal of speculation and I thought it was appropriate 
to tell you about our plans which include a degree of flexibility and 
I think it’s important that you know that because people are jumping 
to conclusions which in the end may not be altogether correct. The initial 
group we plan will travel to the Brighton Barracks in Tasmania. There 
are other centres I don’t intend to name them all; they are more than 
are required for the purpose. In other words we have had to identify 
where we will locate up to 4,000 people around Australia. We certainly 
envisage there will be utilisation of facilities in Victoria, NSW, WA, 
QLD, and South Australia, but the final choices will be made at points 
in time where we have to make the accommodation arrangements. There 
are reasons for that, they are logistic reasons, they relate to the 
timing, availability, they relate to the issues of provadoring in the 
most appropriate way. But what we have been able to do is identify more 
than sufficient accommodation for the purpose and final choices as I 
say will be made over time.

  

 The Department of Defence is preparing accommodation 
over the coming week. I am particularly grateful for the efforts of 
my Department and the other departments involved, and particularly the 
cooperation I am receiving from my colleague John Moore the Minister 
for Defence because it is a major logistical exercise and it puts very 
considerable demands on a great many people and they have been fulsome 
in their efforts, unstinting in their time, and I think demonstrating 
the undoubted professionalism of our public services in Australia.

  

 We are also seeking to use very fully the support 
of the voluntary sector and might I say that there has been an enormous 
response from people right around Australia. I couldn’t catalogue 
it all for you, it is difficult to bring together all the offers of 
support and assistance that have been made but we are intent in organising 
both departmentally and within the voluntary sector support which will 
include access to interpreters, torture and trauma counselling, appropriate 
cultural briefings and particularly for those staff that will be at 
the accommodation centres and obviously interacting with the arrivals 
I am very grateful for the large numbers of people who have made offers 
of support. I think it demonstrates the generosity of heart of the Australia 
people.

  

 You will undoubtedly want to ask me about whether 
of not billeting out might be a reasonable approach. I do want to say 
something about that because there have been many, many offers from 
people who would like to participate in that way. They are enormous 
difficulties in being able to take up all of those sorts of offers, 
not only in logistic terms but in terms of being able to provide the 
appropriate level of services that are required and it can only reasonable 
done at central locations. I’m sure you would appreciate that there 
is also some uncertainty about the time that these folk might remain 
in Australia. We will be visoring them for a period of three months. 
There will be a capacity to be able to provide extensions of time if 
and as the circumstances require. The legislative arrangements are at 
an advanced stage. I anticipate the regulation to put in place the appropriate 
visa class will be completed by early next week and the legislation 
is being drafted and discussions are proceeding with interested parties 
with a view to finalising that for early introduction to the Parliament. 
I think that’s really all that I should say at this stage but if you 
have any questions I’m happy to respond.

  

  Question:

  

 East Hills

  

  Minister:

  

 Well the East Hills establishment is defence facility 
and it’s an establishment a that does have accommodation because we 
need to accommodate people when they first arrive in Australia. It’s 
where we’re able to provide the appropriate level of access for health 
screening. We’ll be undertaking some initial health screening off 
shore but it won’t be able to be done comprehensively in the time 
that we have. Health screening involves certainly x-rays and obtaining 
specialist advice from people who are experienced in these matters sometimes 
it takes many weeks to be able to undertake these sorts of checks, in 
an off-shore location to get the information for Australian officials 
you wouldn’t be able to do that adequately in an off-shore situation 
in the time frame so the more comprehensive health checking has to be 
undertaken here in Australia and the facility in East Hills allows us 
to undertake that.

  

  Question:

  

 Is there going to be a restriction on the movement 
of people who are placed in these facilities?

  

  Minister:

  

 Well I made it very clear the movement of people will 
be voluntary to Australia. When they come to Australia they are being 
accommodated. My wife has been saying to me over the last few days ‘stop 
saying held’, they are going to be accommodated and that means we 
will provide accommodation, and food and care, but we are not detaining 
people. If they wish to leave a centre they will be free to leave but 
they won’t be able to be supported in the same way. There are enormous 
logistical difficulties in trying to make those sorts of arrangements 
and to do so with people who have had no experience in living in the 
sort of society we are would be an unreasonable ask in the sorts of 
time frame that we are operating in.

  

 But I would hope that if Australians wanted to befriend 
people that are here they wanted to come to know them in they wanted 
to take them on outings, if they wanted to give them a little respite 
away from the facilities that all of that can be accommodated. But we 
could not provide and guarantee the appropriate level of care and sustenance 
were we to try and disperse people right throughout the Australia community. 
Some of the people that do say ‘well we’re happy to billet but we 
want to know how we are going to meet our expenses’. You get various 
levels of support that would be offered. Some would be offering it totally 
some would be saying ‘we want reimbursement’. You can just image 
the sorts of difficulties that would be associated with trying to put 
together an exercise of that sort. So this is to provide flexibility 
but to be able to provide certainty.

  

  Question:

  

 Inaudible

  

  Minister:

  

  Look there are a number of military establishment in each of the states 
that I have mentioned and there are places that I cou ld name 
but the point is that once you name it people go out and say ‘we’ll 
get a picture of this, we’ll photograph that’ and I’ve got no 
problem with that. I saw that with East Hills this morning in some of 
the press. We may not be using all of the facilities...

  

  Question:

  

 Inaudible

  

  Minister:

  

 What we are looking at is a variety of forms of accommodation. 
Some of it will be housing, some will be barracks, and we have identified 
more than sufficient accommodation for the total number of people who 
are involved and we will be making decisions about the timing and in 
relation to the particular locations that will be used during the course 
of the locating of people in Australia. But we have more than sufficient 
accommodation that we have identified that potentially can be available 
for this purpose.

  

  Question:

  

 Inaudible

  

  Minister:

  

 Well, I wasn’t going to talk a great deal about 
those sorts of matters today because I think it could distract from 
the principle announcements that I am making. But let me just say that 
the Australian community is a multicultural community. We have people 
here from a great many backgrounds and here in Australia we have demonstrated 
over long period of time that people from quite different and divergent 
backgrounds can live side by side in our communities and they do. And 
while there are elements of the Australian community, who may have views 
that they may want to express on the NATO involvements for instance, 
upon the events as they have unfolded, in a society in a democratic 
society like ours they are able to express those views. But they have 
to do so, and I have said to people who were in these very rooms yesterday, 
they have to do so within the very framework of the compact that we 
have.

  

  We are a tolerant society and that rests upon each group accepting 
that their presence in Australia tolerantly accepted demands that they 
have to equally accept others in the Australian community. It is a compact 
in which people are expected to observe ou r laws and basic structures 
of our society which include that we are a Parliamentary Democracy, 
that people are punished if they break the law and I have absolutely 
no doubt that while we may experience occasional incidents and they 
have only been occasional, and which we regard as totally unacceptable 
they inevitably involve only a minority and I have no doubt that responsible 
community leaders will ensure that the understanding that I have put 
to you about the nature of our society is well understood and I have 
found in my discussions, I have met with the Albanian community and 
Serbian community in Melbourne and Sydney, I have no doubt that they 
will not be unwelcoming in relation to the people who are being evacuated 
here form Kosovo.

  

  Question:

  

 Any idea of cost and will you increase the overall 
level of immigration?

  

  Minister:

  

 The overall immigration intake is a matter we address 
in the context of submissions I’ll be making to the Government in 
the course of the next month or so and I don’t intend to say anything 
about the overall immigration intake.

  

 What I have said is that this is a measure and humanitarian 
response to a crisis in which people will be able to come to Australia 
on a temporary basis. It should not be seen as a basis upon which people 
who have an immigration intention ought to think that they can get to 
Australia and then make other decision later about remaining here permanently, 
it will not lead to that outcome. If people have in mind an immigration 
intention they have to make their applications for places within a program 
that is tremendously diverse in its operation. It has a humanitarian 
element, it has a family reunion element, it has a skilled element.

  

 When we deal with the humanitarian element we makes 
judgements about priorities on the basis of people’s needs. If people 
believe that within the ambit of the special humanitarian program for 
which there are places, something like half the numbers of places are 
going to the former Yugoslavia this year. Now there may be some prioritisation 
changes because of the needs of assessments of needs. But people who 
are looking for a permanent outcome have to look to those programs and 
opportunities. I will be endeavouring to ensure that in the operation 
of those schemes that flexibility is required. Question: re Chinese 
students

  

  Minister:

  

 Well what we know is that there are very large numbers 
of people who are displaced. There has been a request for burden sharing 
which we are participating in and we have committed ourselves to this 
assistance in the knowledge that amongst those people there are those 
that would be happy to accept the certainty that is provided in terms 
of health care in terms of support and assistance in terms of the efforts 
that will be undertaken here to provide an opportunity where people 
will be properly cared for and where they can be readily available to 
return to their homes when the matter is resolved.

  

 Now I am well familiar, as you would know with what 
has happened in the past. I as Minister have had to resolve a number 
of situation involving people who have been here temporarily and we 
have had to do so in a number of ways, some of which have required people 
to leave and some of which have enabled numbers of people to stay. One 
of the reasons that we are intent upon regulation that prescribe a short 
period of temporary stay is not to build up unrealistic expectations 
that the stay will be long if its possible for people to return early, 
that’s why it is a three month visa. That is very different to the 
circumstances surrounding the decisions taken immediately after the 
Tiannamin Square event.

  

  Question:

  

 I’m legislating, and we’ve had the support of 
the opposition in relation to this, to specifically provide a legal 
environment in which our capacity to remove people where we can in dignity 
and safety to their homes can be facilitated without efforts by the 
well meaning professions of which I am a member to thwart that intention, 
and that is the reason that we are legislating. We are dealing with 
this matter in a very different environment because of the experience 
that we have had in the past and the experience with which I am very 
much familiar.
