 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  KIRRIBILLI HOUSE, SYDNEY

 E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Ladies and gentlemen as you know I leave this morning to go to the United States and  then after that I’ll go to Canada and Ireland. It’s always important to visit the United  States, our closest and most powerful ally. There is much on the international scene,  including in particular Iran, relations with China and the situation in the Asia Pacific  region generally and they are some of the matters that I will discuss with the President  and other senior members of the Administration. I’ll have the opportunity when I’m  there to meet all of them, as well as delivering a major speech on Australian foreign  policy in Chicago. After then I visit Canada at the invitation of the newly elected  Canadian Prime Minister. As fellow Commonwealth countries, Australia and Canada 

 have much in common and this will be an opportunity for us to talk about many things  that, as energy rich countries, Australia and Canada have in common. And finally, for  the first time as Prime Minister I will visit Ireland and given the very close historical  and sentimental links between Australia and Ireland, that is a visit which is long  overdue.   

 JOURNALIST:    

 Prime Minister, Kim Beazley’s labelled this trip a holiday.   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Well that is just childish. It is in the interests of this country that the Prime Minister of  Australia, no matter who he is, Labor or Liberal, should travel regularly and that is 

  1

 what I’m doing. It’s in Australia’s interests that I undertake this sort of travel and he  knows it.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, what will you be telling the Americans about David Hicks?   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Well we want Hicks brought to trial as soon as possible. That’s been our position for a  long time. What’s holding it up at the moment is not the American Administration or  the Australian Government. It’s a court challenge within the United States which has  the sympathy and the support of Mr Hicks and his lawyers and until that court  challenge is resolved, the Military Commission trial can not go ahead, and that  challenge has been responsible for about at least a year’s delay in Hicks being brought  to trial. But I certainly am unhappy that it is taking so long for him to be brought to  trial, but some of the recent delays are not the fault of the American Government and  it’s certainly not the fault of the Australian Government.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What will happen to David Hicks if Guantanamo Bay closes?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well the important thing is to get the trial brought on and I don’t believe that  Guantanamo Bay is going to change in the near future and I would certainly hope that  the Military Commission trial of Mr Hicks is brought on as soon as possible. But we  do not believe that he should come back to Australia without facing a Military  Commission. He can not be charged with any offence in this country and given the  seriousness of the allegations made against him, we remain of the view that he should  face trial before the Military Commission and the conditions of that Military  Commission have been greatly changed as a result of representations made by  Australia.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 I’m sure Lord Goldsmith’s remarks would be something that would be discussed,  would they be something you would be discussing with the President?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Not necessarily, no.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, is Australia’s involvement in any planned military action in Iran an  option?   

 PRIME MINISTER: 

  2

 

 In Iran?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Yes.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 There’s been absolutely no thought given to that. I’m not in favour of other than  trying to achieve a diplomatic solution. It’s quite hard. This is a test for the United  Nations. At the time of the Coalition operation in Iraq, Australia, the United States  and the United Kingdom were all attacked for not leaving it to the United Nations.  Now Iran is in the hands of the United Nations and it will be a very big test of the  processes of the United Nations to see if that matter can be resolved. I think we  should continue to try diplomatic processes. 

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 But given that you didn’t trust the UN in the case of Iraq, what’s changed with Iran?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 It’s not a question of not trusting the UN, it’s a question of the UN having failed in  Iraq. Now it has another opportunity on this occasion. I mean what we did in Iraq was  based on a Security Council Resolution. But the alternative was that we should leave  it endlessly to further United Nations processes and that did not work. The United  Nations failed in relation to Iraq. I hope it now has an opportunity to succeed in  relation to Iran, and it should be given the opportunity to do so.    

 JOURNALIST:    

 Mr Howard, what do you think it entails this time?   

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Well I’m not going to start hypothesising about that. We all want a sensible resolution  but a resolution that recognises that a nuclear Iran is a potential danger to the Middle  East.   

 JOURNALIST:    

 Prime Minister in Iraq, will Australian troops go to more dangerous areas like Basra?   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 We have said that we’ll continue to look after the Japanese and if the Japanese, as is  anticipated, sometime this year pull out of Al Muthanna, we will maintain a presence  in the southern part of Iraq. We’ll be involved in training, we’ll be involved in other  matters related to the security of the country with a view to the Iraqis themselves 

  3

 being able to look after their position. We are still considering and discussing with our  allies precisely what Australian troops will do. I can assure you that the decision we  take will pay particular regard to their security and their safety. But we must  understand that no matter where people are in Iraq, it is dangerous. 

 

 JOURNALIST:    

 Mr Howard, on the home front, what do you think of Mr Beazley’s speech last night?   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Mr Beazley’s had ten years in opposition and he still has not got a coherent alternative  plan to maintain and develop the Australian economy. The key challenge for an  alternative Prime Minister is to tell Australians how he would do it better. He didn’t  even tell us how he would do it as well.   

 JOURNALIST:    

 You said it was Simon Crean’s effort I think…   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Yes I thought Simon Crean’s Budget reply in 2003 was a very good Budget reply. See  what Mr Crean did in 2003 was actually lay out some alternative policies in areas like  health and education. He had a go at being an alternative prime minister in his Budget  reply. Mr Beazley’s had 10 years. I mean it’s not as if he’s just become the Leader of  the Opposition. He’s had 10 years and he still has not given the Australian people an  alternative of how the country would be governed under Labor.   

 JOURNALIST:    

 Prime Minister, can I ask you about the Papuan woman Mrs Wainggai? What is the  Government doing about that situation?   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Well I think it’s important that we allow the normal processes to operate and it’s not  for us to do, other than follow Australian law, which we have done in relation to the  43. Thank you.   

 JOURNALIST:    

 (inaudible) are heading north to West Papua. Can you tell us why the urgency?   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 Heading where?   

 JOURNALIST:    

  4

 …I believe they are heading north to West Papua.   

 PRIME MINISTER:    

 They don’t have any instructions to go to West Papua.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are they heading north?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well look the Australian Defence Force, they’ve got to head somewhere, I mean they  can’t just sort of remain becalmed like the ‘Ancient Mariner’, and they are obviously  being deployed, and what the ADF does, is to make sure that the assets of the  Australian Defence Forces are used in such a fashion that if requests for assistance do 

 come, we’re in a position to respond to them quickly.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Is it an urgency that they’re moving?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well there have been no requests for any involvement if you’re thinking of East  Timor. Put Papua out of your mind please. If you’re thinking of East Timor, we have  had absolutely no requests, but I simply repeat that what the military does, quite  sensibly, is use its assets in such a way that if we were to receive a request we’d be 

 able to respond. Thank you.
