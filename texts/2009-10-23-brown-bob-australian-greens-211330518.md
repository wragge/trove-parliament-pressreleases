 Bob Brown   PM should outline regional humanitarian ground  rules for asylum seekers  Media Release | Spokesperson Bob Brown

 In light of growing concern about the conditions which asylum seekers 

 wanting to come to Australia will face in Indonesian detention camps, 

 the Prime Minister should seek assurances from Jakarta that clear 

 humanitarian ground rules are established. 

 Australian Greens Leader Senator Bob Brown said: "Besides our legal 

 requirem



 ent to abide by international humanitarian laws, Australian 

 Government policy towards asylum seekers should reflect our 

 compassionate and 'fair-go' society. This nation has taken aboard many 

 thousands of refugees in recent decades and these thousands have 

 enriched our society in return." 

 Immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson Young said: "At the top of 

 the Prime Minister's list should be for Indonesia to sign the UN Refugee 

 Convention. We need to go beyond an agreement on where and how asylum 

 seekers are detained." 

 "Kevin Rudd must seek assurances that children and families will not be 

 imprisoned and that the refugee claims are processed in a fair and 

 timely manner. The Prime Minister must also consider an increase in the 

 humanitarian intake in order to help resettle these refugees," Senator 

 Hanson-Young said.
