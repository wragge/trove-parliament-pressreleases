 ACT Division of the Australian Red Cross International Humanitarian Law Committee The Importance of the International Criminal Court Main Committee Room, Parliament House, Canberra 5:40 pm, Thursday 9 August 2001

 Introduction

 The surrender of Slobodan Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has focussed world attention on the possibility of putting an end to impunity for individuals who commit gross atrocities under the guise of war. The establishment of the International Criminal Court is one practical way that we help ensure that this goal is achieved.

 War should not be used as a cover for genocide. It cannot used as a justification for murder and torture. And it cannot cloak the rape of innocent women and children.

 The ICC will help bring the perpetrators of these sorts of crimes to justice. And it will preserve and promote the ideals of peace and freedom. These are ideals that Australians jealously protect but often take for granted. But they are also ideals for which generations of Australians have fought and died.

 There is ongoing debate about what the ICC will or will not do. I aim today to set the record straight.

 Perhaps the most insidious of the criticisms levelled at the ICC is that the establishment of the Court is not in Australia’s interests. And that any decision to ratify the ICC Statute would be to surrender Australian sovereignty. Such claims are unfounded.

 Suggestions that the Howard Government is captive to some form of international political correctness ignores our history of engagement with the United Nations and other treaty bodies. As a Government we have actively challenged the United Nations treaty body system for its failures. We have also staunchly defended Australia’s right to determine its own affairs in accordance with our rigorous democratic processes.

 This has not made us popular in some circles. However, the Government’s first priority is to protect Australia’s national interests. Testament to this is our review of our relationship with UN treaty bodies and our resistance to criticism from UN committees acting outside their mandate

 and intruding into domestic political debates. And our reforms to the domestic treaty processes to encourage public and parliamentary scrutiny of those processes are another example of our determination to ensure that we engage with the international community in a way that is consistent with our domestic interest.

 It is against this background that the Government decided to support the establishment of the ICC.

 We support the International Criminal Court because it is in the national interest to do so. We support the ICC because it will bring international criminals to justice. We support the ICC because it will protect and promote the very ideals and freedoms for which Australians have fought and died. We support the ICC because a more stable world community, where gross criminal conduct is not tolerated, ensures a safer world in which Australians can live, work, trade and travel. We support the ICC because not to do so would be to the detriment not only of those living in Australia today and but also of our future generations.

 Importantly, we support the ICC because it has many of the checks and balances that are lacking in many of the UN treaty bodies. Its functions and role have been carefully articulated and its powers circumscribed to protect the sovereignty of the countries who support its establishment.

 Its prosecution power may be exercised only by the United Nations Security Council, by States Parties to the ICC Statute, and by the ICC Prosecutor, subject to special conditions regulating the Prosecutor’s authority.

 Origins of the International Criminal Court

 The ICC is s not a new idea. The need for an International Criminal Court has been prompted by many decades of international conflict.

 The concept originated after an unsuccessful attempt to establish an international tribunal after the First World War. In the aftermath of World War Two, there were the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crime Tribunals. And more recently, the UN has established International Criminal Tribunals to deal with the atrocities in Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia.

 But these Tribunals have been ad hoc, and have been set up after the events, when the situation has already reached disastrous proportions.

 The ICC is not a new or radical proposal. It is basically an attempt to address the shortcomings of arrangements that are already in place.

 Characteristics of the ICC - Complementarity

 Before I set about debunking some of the myths surrounding the ICC, I want to make it clear what the ICC is.

 The cornerstone of the ICC is what is referred to as the principle of complementarity. This means that States will still have the primary opportunity, and the primary obligation, to prosecute and punish war criminals. This has always been the case - it is critical to understand that the ICC will not take away the responsibility of States to carry out their own prosecutions.

 The ICC will only act when a State is either unwilling or unable genuinely to act. The sovereignty of States will in no way be challenged by the ICC.

 Serious Crimes

 It is also important to note that the ICC will be restricted to the most serious crimes of international concern.

 The ICC won't try cases of purely domestic interest. It will have no authority to prosecute Governments for the formulation of policies. It will only be able to try individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

 Retrospectivity

 Finally, the ICC will not operate retrospectively. Past crimes will not be subject to investigation and prosecution.

 The ICC will be a new body, and it will only deal with new cases that arise.

 Establishment of the ICC

 The ICC Statute must be ratified by 60 countries - 37 have already done so, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand. The United Kingdom has passed legislation to enable it to ratify. President Clinton authorised signature of the Statute for the United States on 31 December last year. At the moment the Bush administration is reviewing that decision.

 Although it is no guarantee, the very fact that so many countries have signed up to the ICC is a fair indication that the Court is a worthwhile idea. Australia has not yet made a final decision about supporting the ICC. The treaty processes are still in train.

 Essential Features of the International Criminal Court

 In essence, the ICC is a Court which will bring the perpetrators of the most serious international crimes to justice. The Court will only try individuals. It will not try governments or their policies. And it will only act when governments are unwilling or unable to do so.

 These are the facts. And there is nothing in the facts that should give any of us any cause for concern.

 Misconceptions about the International Criminal Court - Sovereignty

 Having said what the ICC is - I would now like to say what the ICC is not.

 I know there are many who are highly critical of the ICC and I want to address their criticisms in a direct and straightforward way. The ICC is too important to be derailed by innuendo and half-truths. It is important that the facts are laid bare so that people can make their own informed and considered assessments.

 The most scurrilous myth doing the rounds is that the ICC will undermine Australia’s sovereignty. The fear is that Australian citizens will be arrested and prosecuted by a foreign Court and that the authority of Australian Courts will be ignored.

 I give you my categorical assurance that the ICC will never override the Australian judicial system.

 As I have already said, the ICC will only be able to act when States are unable or unwilling to do so.

 The Australian Government will have full coverage of statute crimes and we will always be able to prosecute first.

 It is true that the ICC would be able to act if Australia were shielding a war criminal from trial. But Australia has never - and will never - be in the business of protecting war criminals, so such a situation is not going to happen.

 It should also be remembered that the prospect of Australians being tried by foreign Courts for war crimes has existed under the Geneva Conventions since 1949. In the last 52 years I have never heard of anyone who thinks that adhering to the Geneva Conventions is an impost on our national sovereignty!

 Finally, it may be trite to say, but it is nevertheless the case that if countries and individuals have done nothing wrong, they have nothing to worry about. Australia’s history in the battlefield and our international humanitarian record is beyond reproach. We have nothing to fear from the ICC. It is the war criminals, and the sham governments they hide behind, whom the ICC will target. And they are the ones who have most to gain if the ICC fails to become a reality.

 Constitutional Violation

 There have been claims that the ICC would violate Chapter III of our constitution and override the supremacy of Australian Courts. This is a furphy.

 The ICC’s existence would be totally independent of Chapter III. The ICC will not have power over any Australian Court. And it will not in any way affect the delivery of justice in Australia.

 Australia has been subject to the International Court of Justice for over 50 years and this has not violated our constitution or judicial independence. The ICC won’t have any effect on our constitution or judicial independence either.

 Scope of Prosecutions

 It has also been suggested that the ICC will somehow be used as an instrument of ‘social engineering’. The conspiracy theorists argue that the Court will try cases based on national policies such as abortion, marriage and homosexuality. These claims are totally false.

 As I have said, the ICC will only deal with serious international crimes - it will not be concerned with domestic social policy issues.

 Standards

 Another claim is that the ICC will be some sort of ‘Kangaroo Court’ and that it won’t apply the standards that Australians expect from a Court of justice.

 By necessity the ICC will apply a blend of different legal systems. But, at the end of the day, the

 Court will respect the basic legal principles that are applied in Australia and throughout the world. The presumption of innocence, the need to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt and the observation of due process will all apply at the ICC.

 The ICC won’t operate in exactly the same way as an Australian Court, but I assure you that it will operate in a completely fair and just way.

 Quality of Judges

 Not content with attacking the standards of the ICC, the scaremongers have also been busy casting doubt on the quality of the judges.

 Given that no judges have been appointed it seems a bit early to start assassinating their characters!

 Nevertheless, the process for selecting judges gives an indication of the rigour that will be applied to the making of appointments.

 The judges will not be anonymous appointees. They will be elected by an Assembly of States Parties, which will be a body representing the States which have committed to the ICC.

 Judges will hold office for 9 years and, except for some special provisions that apply to the first group of judges elected, they will not be eligible for re-election. Judges must be citizens of the States that are party to the ICC. They must be must be of highest moral character. They must be impartial. They must be qualified to hold the highest judicial office in their own country. And they must be experts in Criminal Law or International Law. No two judges may be of the same nationality. And there will also be a fair representation between male and female judges and between judges from different legal systems.

 The composition of the benches of the Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda suggests that persons of the highest calibre are likely to be selected. For example, Australia has been represented at these Tribunals by Sir Ninian Stephen and Justice David Hunt.

 It is all too easy to run around saying the ICC will be a Kangaroo Court. And it is a cheap shot to attack the quality of judges that will serve on the ICC.

 The facts speak for themselves. The ICC will be a genuine Court. It will adhere to the highest standards of law and it will be staffed by judges of the highest standing.

 The ICC and Political Motivation

 The final myth I want to address is the notion that the ICC’s prosecutions will be motivated by politics rather that justice.

 This will not be the case. Numerous measures will be in place to ensure that the Court does not conduct itself in a political manner.

 The Court will only be able to prosecute cases which fit within its jurisdiction. The prosecutor may elect not to proceed if there are substantial reasons to believe an investigation would not serve the interests of justice. And if a prosecutor decides to proceed, States will have ample opportunity to argue against that decision.

 Politics is not the motivating factor behind the ICC. The Court is motivated by justice. In certain circumstances this will mean prosecuting war criminals where the States will not. If this is what critics mean by acting in a political manner - then so be it. As I have said, the ICC is not going to let rogue States get away with protecting war criminals.

 Why Australia Should Support the ICC

 Far from being something Australians should fear, the ICC is something that we should all support. The fact is that the ICC will work to our benefit.

 It will promote peace and stability in our region and it will enable the international community to act against rogue States.

 Furthermore, by acting as a deterrent against wide scale violence, the ICC may reduce the number of displaced persons seeking asylum. This will reduce the need for countries like Australia to provide a safe haven for refugees.

 Finally, it important to note the Defence Force supports the ICC and will benefit from its establishment.

 Too often Australian peacekeepers find themselves in situations where law enforcement and judicial systems do not exist. As a result our soldiers find themselves in a position where they are expected to assume the responsibility for bringing the perpetrators of war crimes to justice.

 The ICC will fill this vacuum and it will allow our troops to concentrate on their own duties.

 The Court will also be of direct benefit to Defence Force personnel. If they fall victim to war crimes, the ICC may be able to investigate and prosecute crimes on their behalf.

 Australia’s Position

 Australia has signed the Statute indicating that we will commit to the ICC, but we have not yet formally ratified.

 It is obvious from my comments that the Government strongly supports the ICC. I’m pleased to note that on 25 June a majority of the Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that Australia should ratify the Statute.

 At the same time it is important that we do not rush into any decision. It is imperative due processes are followed before we commit ourselves one way or the other.

 The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is currently conducting a public inquiry into the ICC. Until the Committee's work is finished, and it has made its final recommendations, the Government will not be committing Australia to the ICC.

 So even though I support the ICC, the Government will take all views on board before a final decision is made. Our participation in the ICC is by no means a fait accompli. This is a process which takes time but we want to get it right, and I am confident that our treaty process will ensure that we do.

 I note in this regard that the draft legislation which would support ratification of the ICC is

 expected to be finalised in the next couple of weeks. We have indicated to the JSCOT that we be providing them with an exposure draft of the legislation to be considered as part of their examination of the Statute and proposal for ratification. I am sure that there are many individuals and organisations, including key stakeholders such as the RSL and Red Cross, that will be keen to provide the Committee with comments on the draft legislation. I look forward to the Committee’s consideration of that important part of the ICC proposal.

 Conclusion

 There are many rational and logical reasons for supporting the ICC. But there is one straightforward and compelling reason. As we speak, people are committing terrible crimes against humanity - and they are getting away with it. The ICC will help stop these crimes. And it will bring the international criminals to justice.

 For my own part I believe that our national interest, as well as our sense of justice, our sense of humanity and our compassion for our fellow man, demand that we give the ICC our full support.
