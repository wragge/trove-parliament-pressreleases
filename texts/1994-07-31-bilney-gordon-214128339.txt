 Minister tor Development Cooperation · Minister for Pocific Island Affnirs  Gordon Bilney MPMDC 63 31 July 1994O  'AUSTRALIANS SHOW EXTRAORDINARY GENEROSITY INRWANDAN RESPONSEThe Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, today praised the extraordinary generosity o f Australians in their massive response to the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda."The horrifying situation affecting millions o f Rwandans has tapped a deep well of compassion in the Australian community. Donations to public appeals are around the $10 million mark and many people have volunteered their services to assist the relief effort.â   f"The terrible images o f human suffering broadcast into our homes from the refugee camps have touched Australians and have prompted a fantastic response that shows that Australians are ready to lend a helping hand to those in need," M r Bilney said.M r Bilney also praised those Australians who had offered goods and other practical help to the relief effort but emphasised that the best and most effective way for people to help was to donate money to the relief appeals run by Australian non-government aid agencies."These aid agencies are doing a tremendous job on the ground, with aid workers . showing enormous courage and commitment in their efforts to stem the tide o f human misery. Australians can best help the people o f Rwanda by continuing to provide funds for these efforts," M r Bilney said.The Australian Government is itself providing substantial funds through these organisations as a key part o f the $10 million package o f humanitarian relief.Together with the $25 million commitment o f an Australian Medical Support Force o f more than 300 personnel and public contributions, Australia is providing around $45 million to relieve the plight o f Rwandans.The telephone numbers for donations to public appeals are printed on the reverse of this release.Richard M oore (Minister's Office) 06 277 7660Cathy Walker (AIDAB) 06 245 4203 or 018 097 450COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY MICAH
