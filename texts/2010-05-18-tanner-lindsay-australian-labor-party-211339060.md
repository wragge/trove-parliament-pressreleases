 44 Projects to Drive ICT Efficiency 

 The Rudd Government today announced that 44 new IT projects from 20 different government  agencies will share in funding as a result of the Australian Government’s $502.4 million investment in  ICT efficiency. 

 These projects will be funded from the ICT Business-As-Usual Reinvestment Fund which was  established following the Review of the Australian Government’s Use of Information and  Communication Technology conducted by Sir Peter Gershon in 2008. 

 Lindsay Tanner, Minister for Finance and Deregulation said:  “In 2008 the Rudd Government  embarked on an ambitious program to tackle the inefficiencies in everyday IT activities undertaken by  agencies which contribute to the overall operational costs of running government.” 

 “As part of this program, the Rudd Government achieved more than $1 billion in savings over four  years, half of which was used to set up the Reinvestment Fund to support new IT projects that further  improve government agencies’ operational efficiency and effectiveness.” 

 To date, more than $230 million from the ICT Business-As-Usual Reinvestment Fund has been  allocated to 44 new projects.   

 For example: 

 â¢ $2 million was allocated to the Bureau of  Meteorology initiative to improve the  distribution of aviation, marine and general  weather forecasts and warnings in regional  offices. Ageing, leased, distributed  equipment will be replaced with a more  cost effective and operationally robust  virtualised equipment clusters in each  state. 

 â¢ $2.2 million was allocated to the  Department of Human Services for a trial  of automated outbound dialling technology  which aims to facilitate a more efficient  collection of outstanding child support  payments.  

 Lindsay Tanner said:  “The Rudd Government has set a tight fiscal strategy to ensure the Budget is  returned to surplus as quickly as possible and a key part of this strategy is the ongoing pursuit of  efficiency in government operations. 

 “Since coming to office, we have achieved savings of more than $8.5 billion in the past three Budgets  by reducing waste and inefficiency across government operations in a range of areas such as travel  procurement, property management and IT operations. 

 “The efficiency gains from these 44 projects will generate further savings of an estimated $78.9 million  over four years and $23.9 million annually beyond the forward estimates.” 

 A further $271.1 million will be available to agencies for new ICT efficiency enhancing projects over  the next three years through the reinvestment fund.
