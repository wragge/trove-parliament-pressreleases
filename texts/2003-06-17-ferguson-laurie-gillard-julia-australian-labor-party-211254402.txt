 TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  TUESDAY 17 JUNE 2003   E&OE   

 SUBJECTS: Philip Ruddock misleads Parliament    

 GILLARD: In Question Time today, Minister Ruddock failed to correct the record in  relation to a misleading of Parliament. On the 29th of May, Minister Ruddock said that it  was not for him or his Department, the question of Mr Hbeiche having three Australian  citizen sisters, until he came to consider Mr Hbeiche’s application on the third occasion.  That isn’t true, we know it isn’t true because Mr Hbeiche declared his three Australian  citizen sisters the first time he applied way back in 1996.    

 We gave Mr Ruddock the opportunity today to correct the record and say what he should  have said which is, that he had misled Parliament and to tell us the truth. He didn’t take  that opportunity, the Ministerial Code of Conduct requires him to take that opportunity  and we, today, are saying it is clear that the Minister has misled the House and he has left  the situation that way.    

 Labor will be continuing to pursue the allegations of Mr Hbeiche because we are now,  more certain than ever that the only thing that really changed between the time the  Minister rejected Mr Hbeiche’s application and the time he accepted it, was a donation to  the Liberal Party by Karim Kisrwani   

 Laurie Ferguson will now deal with the second matter we raised in question time today,  the question of the citizenship of Dante Tan.   

 FERGUSON:  Mr Ruddock attempted to initially pass the ball to Minister  Hargreaves, when he well knew that essentially at the time that the decision was made on  citizenship he was the actual Minister. We have a situation here where we go back to  September of 2001, Mr Tan is at a function for the Liberal Party, a Fundraiser, a very  small discrete group is there. He forms a business partnership with a close associate of the  Minister, Mr Kisrwani and also with another political operator in the ….. region, Mr  Hakide. That business between the close associate of the Minister becomes the apported  excuse for him to reverse the previous decision by the department, that he had not formed  a proper business in Australia, that he had been un-contactable, the reason he is un-contactable was that he had provided no address whatsoever. We have a situation where  Mr Kisrwani and the Member for Parramatta both intervened on this matter. Arguments  that supposedly Mr Tan is such a bon- vivant  and an entertaining person that he goes to  Liberal Party fundraisers and do not expect any money from a multi-millionaire according  to Mr Cameron.

 The situation is that he did not meet the requirements for Australian citizenship because  of his absences from this country. The Act says that the only way the absences outside  this country, for the required two year period are if it is in the national interest. If this  person,  a fugitive from stock market swindles in the Philippines has a business which is  an interest in this country is so fundamental to us I think we would like to know what that  business is. Particularly because it is in partnership with one of Mr Ruddock’s close  friends.   

 JOURNALIST: Is it possible the Minister didn’t know about the family connections  of Mr Hbeiche because the Department may not have, in their briefings with him, put that  information in there?   

 GILLARD: If that is the case, then Minister Ruddock, when first asked about this  matter should have said it. We have here, the Hansard from the 29th May, and he doesn’t  say that. He doesn’t say the information was before the Department, but not before me.  He says the information about Mr Hbeiche’s three sisters was not before him and was not  before the Department. He has only changed the version because Labor procured a  document indicating that the Department was on notice about Mr Hbeiche’s three citizen  sisters from August 1996. Minister Ruddock in question time today, consistently quoted  one sentence from this Hansard but failed to quote the next sentence which was his claim  that neither he nor the Department knew and it is with that claim that he has misled  Parliament.  

 

 JOURNALIST: Is this document the reason why you say you are now more certain  than ever that the only change was the donation and if so why don’t you release it?   

 GILLARD:  If you look at the history of this matter, Mr Hbeiche applies,  discloses his grounds for being a refugee and says that he has three Australian citizen  sisters. He is rejected by the Department, he is rejected by the Refugee Review Tribunal,  he is rejected by the Federal Court, he is rejected by the Minister in certain parts where  the Minister says, I don’t even want to hear about this matter again, and then post a  donation, this matter is reconsidered by the Minister and he gets a visa. Well why did the  Minister reconsider it? And if, on the Minister’s version, that was the first time he was  aware of the three Australian citizen sisters, wouldn’t you have gone back to the  Department and said is this the first time the information has been available to us or has it  been a component in every decision made along the way?    

 JOURNALIST: So what has the Minister done here?   

 GILLARD:  Well, firstly the Minister has misled Parliament and failed to  correct the record and secondly in relation to this matter we believe there are still major  questions as to whether the only operative factor on the Minister’s mind was the making  of the donation and it was the making of that donation which led him to allow this man  Mr Hbeiche, an asylum seeker, to remain in Australia permanently.   

 Then of course, there is the matter of Dante Tan, which Laurie Ferguson has raised. The  Philippine’s answer to Christopher Skase. Getting a visa and citizenship after a donation  to the Liberal Party. And there is the Monastery that donated $100,000 to the Minister’s  own local election campaign and got preferential arrangements on religious worker visas.  We say there is a pattern of conduct here, which means the integrity of our immigration  system is an issue. This is a government that campaigned at the last election along the line  of  ‘we decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come’. We

 are still waiting for an answer as to whether one of the circumstances motivating  decisions is whether or not you make a donation to the Liberal Party.    

 JOURNALIST: Is it too late for Mr Ruddock to correct the record tomorrow?   

 GILLARD:  Well, John Howard’s own Ministerial Code Of Conduct says that  you should come into the House at the earliest opportunity and correct the record.  Minister Ruddock  allowed the House to start today without correcting the record, and  then in the face of Opposition questioning continued to stonewall by misquoting from  Hansard and only quoting one convenient sentence and not quoting the sentence that was  an issue.  

 

 JOURNALIST: The practice of Ministerial intervention has been around for  decades in the Immigration system what do you hope to achieve by a Senate enquiry, will  that undermine a longstanding practice?    

 GILLARD:  It isn’t true to say that the practice of Ministerial discretion has  been consistently applied, If you look back over the various Ministers for Immigration we  have had, you will see that Minister Ruddock has used Ministerial intervention far more  frequently than any other Minister.   

  Labor indicated in its Refugee and Asylum Seeker Policy last year, protecting Australia  and protecting the Australian way that we believed that it was inappropriate for there to  be a discretion a Minister could exercise in secret and without review. We proposed at  that stage that there should be and independent expert committee that made open public  recommendations to the Minister on these sorts of matters. Now the Senate select  Committee, which Labor has given notice of yesterday and the creation of which, will be  debated by the Senate on Thursday, would not only be able to look at the individual  allegations we have raised, but the policy question as to whether Labor’s proposed  solution to this issue of Ministerial discretion is the best way forward.
