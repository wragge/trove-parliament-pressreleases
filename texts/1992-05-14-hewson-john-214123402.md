 TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW  DR JOHN HEWSON, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  RANALD MACDONALD, RADIO 3LO

 K & Î E - PROOF COPY ONLY

 SUBJECTS: APPM, Senator Graham Richardson, State Liberal  Parties, Immigration

 Macdonald:

 We've a number of issues to discuss with Dr John Hewson, who  is in the studio with me. And yes", we do have a request in  for the Prime Minister to come in next time he's in Melbourne,  that's just to cut off a few of the political bias calls.  Anyway, we spoke to Senator John Button yesterday.

 Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, usually steers clear of State  politics, but seems to have a different assessment of the APPM  dispute in Burnie than his fellow Liberal, new State Premier,  Ray Groom. .

 Mr Groom says Dr Hewson doesn't understand the local feelings  and the way in which the issue has been handled by management  there. So, I want to ask him about that. Good morning Dr  Hewson.

 Hewson:

 Good morning Ranald.

 Macdonald:

 Well, you do support don't you, the management's right to deal  with over award payments and conditions direct with the  workers and outside of the trade union structure?

 Hewson:

 Well, that's the only point I've made really, that the  management has a right, in my view, to deal directly with its  workers in relation to over award payments. And Ray Groom,  there's no difference between us on that, we both agree on 

 that.

 What 1 was responding to yesterday, is an attempt,  in a sense,  tag us with this dispute. Senator Cook,  for example, is  running around saying that this is an example of how the  Liberal Party would conduct industrial relations. n o w,  I find 

 it rather novel because it’s happening under the centralised  system and I'm not in government.  It's got nothing to do with  us and our policy.

 Macdonald:

 But you do basically agree with the concept, don't you? And  that's part of your policy...dealing directly with workers.

 Hewson:

 Dealing directly with workers,  yes. But,  this is all 

 happening under the centralised system. in our case we would  have a completely different institution and legal structure,  where people would be negotiating on the basis of common law  agreements,  if you like. Employers and employees could opt 

 out of the system and negotiate directly or the workers can  use a union if they wish.

 But,  it's a question of choice, it's a question of being in a  different system, on a common law basis where they would take  a mutual view, if you like, that they work together to deal  â   with the situations of the company. And the APPM dispute is 

 being driven not by ideology, as being suggested, but it’s  being driven by just one cold hard fact - international  competitiveness.

 The desire to be internationally competitive and to have a  wage structure that actually fits that.

 Macdonald:

 Yeah, well, going for world's best ..(inaudible)., is one  thing, but the question I suppose is the way you handle it.  Surely, you're colleague, he's a Liberal Premier of Tasmania,   he criticises management for the way·its handled it. Do you  believe its been ham fistedly...

 Hewson:

 Well, I'm not, as suggest in one of the papers,  backing the  management’s tactics all the way.  All I've commented on is  their right to talk directly to their workers about over award  payments and I stand by that.

 As to how they've handled the detail of the dispute, I'm  clearly not close enough to be able to express an informed  view as to every stage of the process.  But,  I think we should  focus on the fact that they do have a right to deal with their  workers, and that's as far as I've gone.

 - 3-

 Ray Groom is handling it as a State matter. The only other  thing I would say, is under a Hewson/Howard type industrial  relations system, we would not be getting involved in  industrial disputes like this. I mean,  I don't see that's  really the government's role under our type of system to get 

 involved at all. In fact,  one of the greatest temptations,  I  think,  of the government is to get involved and the answer  under our type of system is no. You go and solve it, you've  got the circumstances at the workplace, under common law, to 

 reach a conclusion.

 And that would be another very important difference between us  and what's happening now in Tasmania.

 Macdonald:

 On AM, you discussed Senator Graham Richardson and the  President of the Senate, Sibraa. I just wondered, what basis  you would enforce if you were in power for the rule of 

 behaviour of Ministers? When would you stand a Minister down  or when would you dismiss one? .

 Hewson:

 I think there is a well established precedent in Australia,  under both Parties:  that in circumstances like we've seen in  the case of Senator Richardson, a censure if you like for  misleading the Senate over what is a central element now of  what the Prime Minister is having investigated - he should 

 have stood him down.

 What I've been very surprised at is Paul Keating standing  there and saying, "I'm 100 per cent behind Senator Richardson,  on the basis of what he's told me".  I would think as every  day has gone by and more and more information has emerged,  

 that he should start to question that basis and what Senator  Richardson has told him.

 He has a responsibility to get all the facts.  And 

 particularly where it goes well beyond just Senator 

 Richardson. Here1s money gone from the government,  if you  like, in two instances as documented in the last couple of  days - Austrade giving export market development grants to  companies,  Feedtech and Unipac, that have been associated with  Mr Symons,  at times when he was at or near receivership in the 

 first case and where it was publicly known that he had some  business difficulties. In the latter case,  I think the last  grant was given late last year.

 Now, I challenge the Prime Minister now to provide the  information in relation to those Austrade payments,  and any  others in that respect,  today. 1 mean,  let's not wait for  Monday to have those dragged out or in fact,  we put a freedom 

 of information request on one of them yesterday, through  Andrew Peacock.

 The Prime Minister should release that,  he can release that  information now, he can start to answer some of those 

 questions about why the grant was given, who gave the 

 reference, what assessment was made and so on.

 But I personally don't think that a private report from Graham  Richardson - a mate - to Prime Minister Keating - another mate  - is going to satisfy anybody. The Prime Minister has a responsibility to fully investigate the matter and all the 

 links between his Government and Mr Symons and the Marshall  Islands affair and give a full public account of what has  happened.

 He didn't say in his release last night whether he's actually  going to release this report that Senator Richardson is  giving.

 Macdonald:

 But on what you know so far, would you say it's gone beyond  standing down? Is it a dismissible offence?

 Hewson:

 Well, he should have stood him down immediately.

 Macdonald:

 ..(inaudible)..

 Hewson:

 I've said consistently that he should stand him down and  investigate the matter and if found guilty, dismiss him. It's  getting to the point where he's very close to where he ought  to be dismissed. Because every day, as Îª say, every piece of 

 information raises more questions than it provides answers.

 It isn't good enough to have this sort of dribbling out and  the Prime Minister letting it drift. He's got to act and he's  got to act decisively and I think in the circumstances now  where's he taken a public position in defence of Senator  Richardson, he should stand him down, sure, get a report from 

 Senator Richardson, but do his own investigation of these  links. I

 I mean, there're a lot of very important links, not only in  relation to this, but's much broader. We see links between Mr  Symons and the Rothwells situation. Now, there've been many  questions by us, on the record, about the bail out of 

 Rothwells. and there's been evidence given that there were  links between that ball out, the organisation of that bail out  and Federal Government Ministers. -

 - 5-

 I think the whole area now is subject to public concern and it  ought to have some answers. And quite frankly, the Prime  Minister can't be allowed to get away with the situation  yesterday, he's not prepared to give access to tax files, so 

 that they can't draw conclusions to WA Inc.

 He's got to explain all these links and all these situations  and it begs more questions. As I say, ..(inaudible).. Mr  Symons gets special treatment, if you like, by Rothwells. I  mean, if that's the suggestion, we better have that 

 investigated too.

 Macdonald:

 You talked about WA Inc. also on AM. Don't you want to touch  on the other areas, where the Liberal Party has either been  doing well or badly. You've lost Senator Durack, after all, a  fortnight after you promoted him as Attorney General and then  of course, in New South Wales, Premier Greiner is under some  pressure. And you've changed leaders both in South Australia  and Western Australia.

 Now, which are the pluses and which are minuses of those?

 Hewson; f

 Just on Senator Durack. It is true when Ray Braithwaite left  we had moved a couple of other people in the Shadow Ministry.  I am disappointed to lose Senator Durack, he was a good man  and he was making a very important contribution. But, I not 

 only preach competition, Randal, I believe in it.

 If you can't win pre-selection in our system, then you don't  stay. I haven't been involved in those processes. Every  individual has to stand the risk of challenge, as indeed I  did, and win. Now that Senator Durack has lost pre-selection, 

 I wish him well in his next career, but he's a very valuable  member of the team as it is now.

 The Greiner situation in New South Wales, well, I don't tell  Nick Greiner what to do and he doesn't tell me what to do.  But clearly it has hurt us. It has hurt us in the polls, 

 people when they talk of Liberals, think of Metherell and  think of Greiner. But I am not concerned about that in the  sense that when the election, federal election comes along and  the focus is back on us and back on federal issues and away 

 from State issues, it's been an incessant sort of daily  barrage of information of a State nature. I think the support  will come back to us in the polls. ‘

 The changes of leaders in different States, I mean all those  events are quite unrelated to me. They are State driven  matters and State considerations. -

 - 6-

 Macdonald:

 But they do represent the Liberal Party and important States  of South Australia and Western Australia, I was just wonder  whether you thought on balance, it was a plus, the change in  leadership or a minus for you?

 Hewson:

 Well, I don't want to take sides in those leadership battles.  But clearly, they were fairly decisive wins. There was a very  strong view in both states that the leadership should change  in the way it did. I mean, I think 1 can work very 

 effectively with the two new leaders - Richard Court I've  known for quite some time, Dean Brown I don't know that well,  but I've talked with him and I believe we can work very well.

 As I say, we don't get involved in State politics and they  don't get involved in federal politics. But, it is part of a  process of change in Australia, in the Liberal Party. And as  you know, we've been re-building the Party and re-structuring  the Party and taking new policy positions in the Party. 

 Jettisoning a lot of our past and looking forward to the  future and made, at the Federal level, some quite fundamental  changes.

 Fightback! is not only radical by Australian standards, its  radical by Liberal conservative standards as well. And it  takes a lot of different positions in relation to things like  superannuation, capital gains tax, the targeting of benefits  to low to middle income families and so on, which have not  been a feature of our policy in the past.

 1 think change is generally in the right direction in our  Party and it's all part and parcel of what is required for us  to win government and the State and federal level.

 Macdonald:

 In a moment I'm going to be talking to Dr John Nieuwenhuysen  who is head of the Federal Government's Bureau of immigration  research and that leads us on to the 31,000 cut in the migrant  intake.

 Are you concerned tnat the whole weight of that will be  centred around the loss of skilled workers of people with  particular talents and skills coming to this country?

 Hewson:

 Yes I am. I just make it clear. I think it is a phoney cut,  because it is a cut on the one hand but then of course there's  the special category that's been given the Chinese students  category, which the Minister has admitted could blow out to 

 300,000 by the Year 2000. But, yes, I think it is precisely  wrong.

 I support a cut,  but i support much greater weight on skills,  I think we've got to have a greater understanding of our  labour market and the needs of our labour market.  I think it  is also a fair comment from the point of view of the migrants  themselves.  I don't think it does them much good if they  arrive here, as they've done in recent years, I think some 40  odd per cent of migrants have ended up on some form of 

 government benefit within a short space of time. That's not  doing them any good and it's not doing us any good,  to the  extent that we've got a very difficult labour market now, with  a million unemployed - it compounds that problem, makes it  tougher who are here already, looking for jobs to get work.

 For a lot of reason, I think we've got to recognise that in  the short term our capacity to absorb migrants is restricted.  In the longer term, I would agree with John Nieuwenhuysen that  migration has been overwhelmingly beneficial to Australia and  we have to make a transition in the course of this decade, 

 back to high levels of immigration, but at a time where our  economy has the capacity to absorb them.

 Macdonald: -

 Can you put a figure on it? Because it's a 31,000 cut from  111,000...now, of that 80, there's a considerable amount of  allowance for refugees and also family reunions.  Have you got  any particular different mix, any figures you could put  across?

 Hewson:

 Well, we haven't put figures on it and we've resisted putting  a target on it and I think the targeting process has bought a  lot of the problems in recent years, with the undermining of  the integrity of that system. But, I have said that in 

 recessions in the past,  the net immigration intake has fallen  off to somewhere between 50 and 70-75,000 and that implies  that you could cut tens of thousands off a number which the  government is working to.

 I still think their number is over 100,000 because you add  back,  if you like, the Chinese students.  But they are 

 treating them as a separate category and they've left the  20,000 of them plus, I think they've allowed for 14,000  dependents,  say, 30,000 of those who arrived before June '89  or dependents of that group are in a special category.  And 

 the decision has been left to them in effect.  If they want to  stay here at the end of their four year visa, they can stay.  They won't be forced to go.

 Now, having a blanket exemption like that makes a mockery of  the whole immigration system. To be clear, and I'm not saying  that because they’re Chinese students. I mean, if they were  French or German or anybody else and '  they had been given a  blanket exemption, I mean people would have course for genuine 

 concern.

 How on earth can you do that? Particularly when it is now  being conceded that that group could grow to 300,000,  according to Gerry Hand, by the Year 2000. It makes a mockery  of a 30,000 person cut in immigration announced Mr Hand  earlier this week.

 Macdonald:

 Well, just one last question about the date of the election  and the importance of Victoria to it. First of all, do you  think the Federal election has to follow the Victorian  election?

 Hewson:

 No, I don't. I think Paul Keating may actually go early.  Because I don't think he can get Joan Kirner to go.

 1 don't see too many turkeys looking for an early Christmas  and she1  s going to hang on as long as she can. And he's 

 having difficulty getting her to go early and I think there is  now a much greater probability than there was a few months  ago, that Paul Keating will go early.

 We've had it as early as July as a possibility, but I don't  put a high probability on that.  I think more likely he will  try to deliver a Budget and go in September or October, which  could see Joan Kirner still going, as the press speculation  this week suggested, late November, early December, But,  he's  got a lot of hurdles to get over between now and then.

 This week the Budget deficit has blown out and destroyed One  Nation completely.  His promised tax cuts are undeliverable,  .  interest rates will go back up under the scenario that's been  painted this week.  He may go early, just against that 

 background of not wanting to face the electoral reality of all  that's to come.

 And I think he's a long way from being out of the woods,  

 economically. Our economy is not picking up the way they  think, and in a sense if it does pick up the way they think,   we'll have an exchange rate crisis and he'll have a double  whammy.

 So either way, he’s in a very difficult set of circumstances,  politically and economically.

 Macdonald:

 Okay, thank you very much for coming in.
