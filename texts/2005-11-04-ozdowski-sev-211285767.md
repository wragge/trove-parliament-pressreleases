 “Young People and Their Awareness of Human Rights”  

 Address by Dr Sev Ozdowski OAM, Human Rights Commissioner, UNAA National  Action Plan Forum, Hobart 4 November 2005 

 

 1. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  

 I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we stand, and pay my  respects to their elders both past and present.  

 I make this statement at any function where I speak in order to:  

 â¢ pay my respects to the oldest continuous culture in the world;  

 â¢ stress that Australia is a diverse society and that the First Australians are an  important part of this diversity; and  

 â¢ to demonstrate that we aspire to a just and fair Australia for all.  

 Pym Trueman, Lisa Singh, Justice Pierre Slicer, David Fanning, Sarah Bolt, Patricia  Thompson, other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.  

 2. YOUTH PROJECTS AND HR KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION  

 As my 5 year period as Human Rights Commissioner draws to a close it is fitting that book-ending my stewardship have been projects involving Australia’s young people. It is of course  a truism to say that the future of human rights in this country depends on the next generation;  but that doesn’t mean it is not worth repeating. And I can reliably report that, paraphrasing  Mark Twain, reports of the death of human rights amongst our young people are much 

 exaggerated.  

 One of my final human rights’ projects has been the Young People and Human Rights  Dialogue, which has taken me to many different locations around this great nation of ours. I  talked to groups of young people, usually around twelve at a time, about their knowledge of  human rights and their commitment to ‘values’. These young people variously described  human rights as a range of things, from laws and religious principles, to family and community  ideals, while also demonstrating a keen sense of social responsibility. They recognised that  the enjoyment of rights creates a social contract, which reciprocally requires others’ rights to  be respected.  

 I was encouraged to find that young people were eager to share their observations on  discrimination, equality, tolerance, vilification and many other topics. Overwhelmingly, their  views embody some of the best characteristics of the Australian ‘fair go’ ethos: tolerance, 

 egalitarianism, respect and celebration of difference. Despite their relative lack of human  rights knowledge ‘from above’ (as per Prof Jim Ife), that is our Constitution, domestic laws,  UN conventions et al, their knowledge from below was good. Their vision of the future gave  me much cause for optimism.  

 Our young people are not without their fears and concerns. Effective community education  measures are part of a necessary toolkit designed to tackle some of the negative experiences  our young people face: social isolation; mental health problems; bullying; racism;  homophobia. ‘Holistic’ education is not only about teaching in the school environment, but  also about encouraging the active involvement of youth with communities and voluntary  organisations - experiences which also add to their HR learning curve.  

 Of course I also began my term with a series of youth consultations in preparation for the UN  Special Session on Children held in New York City in 2002. This special emphasis reflects my  responsibility within the Commission for oversight of the implementation of the Convention on  the Rights of the Child (CRC) and on that score 2005 has an added significance with regard  to Australia’s children and young people.  

 3. COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD  

 In September, the United Nations reviewed Australia’s report on its implementation of the  CRC. While significant progress has been made in many areas, there is still much we can all  do, both policy-wise and practically, to ensure that all young persons living in Australia have  the opportunity to enjoy the CRC’s benefits. In that regard it is interesting to note that the  Committee’s concluding remarks gave support to the notion that Australia’s youth would 

 benefit from the creation of a Federal Commissioner for Children and Young People.  

 4. UN WORLD PROGRAM FOR HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION  

 2005 also marks the first year in the UN World Programme for Human Rights Education, the  first phase of which (2005-2007) focuses on education in schools. HREOC will be seeking  ways to stay actively involved in the World Programme, and of finding ways to assist the  implementation of the associated Plan of Action. Informing and educating young people about  what their rights and responsibilities are can be empowering. It provides them with options,  inspiring them to pursue their aspirations with a keen sense of their place in the broader  community. But more on that later.  

 5. CHILDREN IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION INQUIRY  

 Of course some of my work involving children in Australia has been less uplifting. Consuming  two and a half years of my five year term and finding serious breaches of the human rights of  children in immigration detention, as measured against the standards of the Convention on  the Rights of the Child, ‘A last resort?’ reserved its most serious observations for the effects of  long-term immigration detention on the mental health of children.  

 Fortunately, we have since witnessed some softening of the policy, as it relates to the  detention of children and their families. Firstly we had the partial release of children that had  been the subject of my Inquiry after parliamentary tabling of ‘A last resort?’ This was followed  by the Petro Georgiuo inspired amendments to the Migration Act that received parliamentary  approval in late June 2005. These amendments have resulted in the removal from ‘razor-wire’  style immigration detention, of all children and their immediate families into community based  detention.  

 These changes constitute the first ‘pro refugee’ amendments since 1992 and so represent an  important first step. The report of the Palmer Inquiry has also prompted the government to  announce substantial senior management changes to the Immigration Department in an effort  to effect cultural change. It is hoped these changes will ensure the compliance section of the  Department implements government policy in a manner that also acknowledges the human  dignity of its clients.  

 So I think ‘civil society’, including many of you present here today, can take a bow for a job  well done. Not finished yet perhaps but very satisfactory progress.  

 6. MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY CONSULTATIONS  

 The mental health issues uncovered in A last resort? prompted me to examine what sorts of  treatment are available, and a whole new picture of human rights concerns emerged from the  shadows, especially with regards to young people. The report of my community consultations  conducted with the MHCA and the Brain and Mind Research Institute titled: ‘Not for Service’  was launched recently.  

 The story that it unveils with regard to young people is not a pretty one.   The people 

 consulted make two main points.   One, that there is increasing evidence that widespread use  of common drugs such as cannabis, amphetamines, alcohol and ecstasy is contributing to an  increased rate of mental illness among young people. In addition they are making those  young people even more disturbed when they finally present for care.  

 And two, that in treatment of mental illness, it is the State government services that are failing  in the delivery of proper care. It is often a tragic tale of medical neglect and community  indifference.   Those with a mental illness are still being blamed for being sick.  

 In fact the reports that emerged from the consultations were horrifying and affect all  Australians - not just refugees or children of refugees.   Mental illness affects veterans from  distant battlefields, it affects prominent Australians. It affects those who care after the ill in  every State and Territory.   And, tragically, it affects the young.  

 I listened to many, many first hand accounts where alcohol and drugs were linked to  schizophrenia and depression.   Stories about violent behaviour, suicide attempts and  endless bouts of hospitalisation or imprisonment.    It makes young people “thrash around  on the wings of madness” - to use Jo Buchanan words, while the authorities seem unable  to stem the tide.  

 You see, there are almost no services available to deal with both drug addiction and mental  illness.   Medical policy dictates that drug addiction be treated first, before the mental illness is  tackled. And this may lead to at least 20 years of life expectancy being lost. Suicide rates in 

 teenagers and young adults remain historically high.   We were told a great many stories of  preventable suicides of young people.  

 Hopefully the release of ‘Not for Service’, as well as the many other recent critiques of mental  health services in Australia, will prompt State and Federal agencies to start seriously  addressing this system failure. For young people this process cannot commence soon  enough.  

 7. “RIGHTS OF PASSAGE - A DIALOGUE WITH YOUNG AUSTRALIANS  ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS”  

 In concluding let me return briefly to the project I commenced my talk with, ascertaining what  young people in this country know about human rights. You will have to await release of  ‘Rights of Passage’ in a few weeks to get the full picture, but on HR education I can say this.  

 As many of you are aware, no education curriculum at either the state or territory, upper  primary or high school level, contains a stand-alone subject entitled ‘Human Rights’.  Consequently HREOC’s materials (as with other bodies’ texts) are designed to try and fill this  gap, by encouraging teachers and by implication their students, to access a broad range of  human rights materials that may be used in a wide range of different subject streams. While  this may be beneficial, it is no substitute for the kind of hard knowledge about human rights -  in terms of knowledge about international conventions and UN treaties - that can only be  inculcated by teaching a ‘stand alone’ subject.  

 However, whilst the Commission has previously advocated for the formal inclusion of ‘Human  Rights’ as a discrete area of study, such a significant shift is unlikely to occur for some time, if  at all, assuming that education policy makers and curriculum experts are able to be convinced  of the need for such a programme. For this reason, the best use of Commission resources  (and others) in the immediate future is the continued expansion of the current suite of  education materials which are designed to complement the existing upper primary and  secondary curricula. In addressing the specific knowledge gaps identified in this study, the  Commission has already developed resources which introduce young people to these topics. 

 This knowledge ‘gap’ therefore may best be addressed by continuing the promotion of these  existing materials (specifically the Bringing them home education module and Youth  Challenge - Unit 1: Human Rights in the Classroom).  

 8. VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY WORK ASSISTS HR LEARNING PROCESS  

 One of the key findings of the survey was the observable link between human rights  knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. The implication here is that a positive increase in any  one aspect may influence the others, so that young people actively engaged in civic and  political projects are more likely to develop an interest in, understanding of and sympathy for  human rights values and practices.  

 This reflects the finding described in the literature which shows that traditional ‘talk-and-chalk’  classroom techniques are usefully supplemented by activities both inside and outside the  school. Activity-based learning programmes are also more appropriate for younger students,  students who speak English as a second or additional language, and students with learning or  literacy difficulties.  

 Finally, the data shows that young people currently learn much about human rights concepts  from popular media. Education initiatives need to be mindful of this in order to engage with a  young audience, in that measures which are more likely to be successful need to take into  account their experiences and point of view. Given the predominance of US content across  the various media, educators may find this knowledge useful in informing a ‘starting point’ for  the introduction of rights-related concepts - for example, pointing out how Australian laws  differ from those of other countries.  

 Finally informing and educating young people about what their rights and responsibilities are  can be empowering. It provides them with options, inspiring them to pursue their aspirations  with a keen sense of their place in the broader community.  

 As Graham Greene, the famous English novelist wrote in his best-selling book:  “The Power  and the Glory”  

 ‘There is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in’  

 While we are not in a position to open that door to civil society for today’s young people - by  encouraging them to learn about human rights, we can perhaps indicate where it is!!
