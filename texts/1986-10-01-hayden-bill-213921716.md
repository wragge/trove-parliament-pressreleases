 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY: MR HAYDEN'S ADDRESS

 f  COiv'fv'Or.’XVEALTl i l PAixLIAsviEI

 Attached is the text of the statement to be d e l i v e r e d  by 

 the Mi n i s t e r  for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill Hayden MP, to 

 the United Nations General A s s e m b l y  in New York on 1 O c t ober 

 (New York time).

 Mr President,

 My country, Australia, is delighted to see you, the Foreign  Minieter of Bangladesh, presiding over the 41st General  Assembly.  Coming from a major Third world country, you will  bring a special sensitivity to bo many of the problems with '  which we shall be concerned during the Session before us.

 I would also like to express Australia's sincere appreciation to  your predecessor, the former distinguished Permanent  Representative of Spain, for his skill in presiding so  effectively over the 40th Session of the General Assembly. '

 Australia has historical reasons to be conscious of the United  Nations, the grave responsibilities that it bears and the great  hopes invested in it. Our nation was the first to have a  permanent mission accredited to the UN in New York.  An  Australian was the first President of the security Council. A  predecessor of mine, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of  Australia,  was President of this Assembly in its third turbulent  year.  In this 41st year of the UN, Australia is reaching the 

 end of ite fourth term on the Security Council. It has been a  period of high significance,  both to the cause of global  security and the effectiveness of the Council itself.

 There is another good reason why Australians have been more   acutely aware than usual of these developments! 1586 is the   International Year of Peace and Australia has invested great   resources into making it more than just a rhetorical event. The   concept of peace - what it actually is, what obstacles stand in  

 its way, what its maintenance asks of individual citizens - has   been much on our minds this year. Australians have reacted to   the idea of the Year of Peace in an extraordinarily energetic   and committed way and at all levels in our community, from the   moat junior of schoolchildren to the highest levels of  

 government. *

 It is not hard to think of reasons for this degree of interest.   Australia is in an area of the world which seems to be growing   more attractive in the configurations of Great Power interests   and forces. It is in an area which has known great stress from  

 colonisation and the winning of independence.  It is in an area   which has been (for whatever reason) a major killing field over   the past 40 years or so.

 It ia true that Australians have been protected more than moat  from the worst effects of all this, but they have not been  hidden from it. Anxiety about the threat - and even conviction  about the inevitability - of nuclear war haa been found to be  widespread especially among young people in Australia, as in  other parts of the world. This ie a terrible heritage to hand 

 on. The early reality of people my age wag of economic  insecurity, if not deprivation. That was bad enough. The  experience of young people these days is worsei of terrorism and  assassination brought into their homes by television; children 

 starving to death? nuclear explosion and threat. No wonder so  many young people are found to be go cynical and pessimistic.  They appreciate that (euch ia the state of the art of war) it  needs only the tiniest miscalculation or mistake to set off 

 events that can trnnaform all life into instant archeology. They feer the consequences when distant, arcane and often  trivial disagreement la taken up and uaed in the kind of  ideological or nationalist or economic competitiveness that has 

 aet off two world ware eo far thie century.

 Australians, like other normal people, yearn for an end to this  insecurity. Their government believe» that the multilateral  process, and this organisation particularly, offer the most  effective ways to deal with the tensions and problems that  disturb world peace. This 4let General Assembly in the 

 International Year of Peace is an opportune moment to measure  the durability of thoae tensions and problems and the efficacy  of the multilateral way of solving them.

 The most obviously urgent of these tensions is the instability  caused by nuclear weapons. We are on the threshold of  developments which could so change the nature of the strategic  relationship that it could be many, unstable years before the  superpowers are sufficiently confident once more to engage in  productive negotiations. The Australian Government believes 

 that it would be highly dangerous to stumble - as we risk doing  - into the competitive development of ballistic missile defences  and an arms race in space. The discussions last November  between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev gave  significant impetus to the arms control process: for instance, 

 the agreement to accelerate negotiations and the call for early  progress on matters where there is common ground, such as the  principle of reductions in the nuclear arras of the US and the  USSR (appropriately measured) and the idea of an interim INF 

 agreement. Both superpowers have now put forward a number of  detailed proposals for reductions in their nuclear arsenals.  Recent meetings have taken place between US and Soviet arms  control experts.

 i.

 Tho Australian Government hope a that these development!! will  pave tho way for substantial negotiations and early agreement on  deep reductions in offensive nuclear forces.  we hope for  agreement on practical arrangement» and understandings on the 

 iooue of strategic defence and the future of the ABM Treaty,  we  hope that both sides can now show willingness on the issue of a  comprehensive test ban treaty# which the Australian Government  considers a most urgent practical step on the road to nuclear 

 arms control. It is in this context of multilateral action and  agreement on forms of arms control that I draw attention to the  South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty which the Australian  Government supports as a significant step against the  proliferation of nuclear weapons. Australia also wishes to 

 draw attention to.the disarmament provisions of the Antarctic  Treaty, which has provided the effective manner in which  Antarctica has been managed in support of the principles and  purposes of the UN Charter. We re-emphasise our commitment to 

 the existing system for tho managomont of Antarctica and  accordingly, we disagree on this matter with my good friend, the  Prime Minister of Malaysia. Australia was disappointed that the  40th General Assembly broke with the tradition of consensus on 

 this issue. This was not due to the Consultative Parties and we  hope that thin tradition can be restored at this 41st session.

 The fact and the implications of nuclear arms understandably  overshadow the issue of the trade in conventional arms. In the  Australian Government's view, they should not be allowed to do  so. Right now, conventional weapons are being used to kill  people in northern and southern Africa, Afghanistan, Central  America and Cambodia. It is a shameful fact that respectable  members of this Organisation are providing the weapons with  which Iranians and Iraqis are killing each other.  The  Australian Government believes that countries contributing to 

 such tragedies should be held accountable for it, as with  pollution which crosses national borders.  Members of the UN  should agree not to export defence materials to nations engaged  in military conflict or where the potential for conflict is high  or where- it is likely to be used to suppress human rights.  As a 

 first step and at the very least, all states should release more  information on their conventional arsenals and transfers and  subscribe to the Secretary-General's standardised reporting  instrument on military expenditures so that a more accurate  picture of the problem can be built up.

 More than eighty percent of the world's military expenditure -  estimated at more than 900 billion US dollars a * ‘  year and rising   - goes on conventional w e a p o n s . Outlays on conventional arms by   developing countries are estimated as being roughly equal to the

 4

 development assistance they yet from developed countries. Brandt, Palme, the Panel of Eminent Personalities, the  Secretary-Generali these are among a long list of authoritiea  who have described the contradiction botwoon the demands of  militarisation and the demands of development; the waste of 

 scarce human, capital and material resources on the arms race.  Dwight Eisenhower was a loader in war and recovery from war. He  had good reason as President of the United States to warn that  "every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket 

 f i r e d ,  signifies in the final sense a theft from those who  hunger and are not fod, those who are oold nnd nro not olothod.  The world is not spending money alono. It is spending the sweat  of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its  

 children." Thirty years later, the Thorasen Report of tho  Relationship between Disarmament nnd Development still caw the  need to point out that the world can choose to pursue cither the  arms race or a more stable social and economic order. It cannot 

 do both.

 Tha logic cannot be challenged. Poverty, hunger nnd disease are  major causes of social and political instability. They cannot  be tackled effectively when scarce resources are being used for  armaments. Experience shows that unrest leads to government 

 repression in so many countries, leading to tho spread of  authoritarianism. It is no wonder that, in so many countries,  democracy has come to be seen as a luxury# the dansert course of  economically-eound societiee. If military spending is such an  obviously important ingredient in the economic problems of  developing countries, reduction in military spending is an  obviously important ingredient in solutions to these problems.

 As it is, developing countries particularly face grave economic  difficulties from the plague of protectionism in world trade and  the complicated and fragile issue of international debt  adjustment. The World Bank has estimated that farm subsidies by  members of the OECD in 1986 will total more than 100 billion US  dollars. This is a policy that (if permitted to continue) will  lead to ruin for agriculture-based economies. This, in the  main, means the economies of developing countries, who have to  make their way at a time when the international economy as a   whole is undergoing difficulty, uncertainty and challenge. 

 The Australian Government has been involved in the recent GATT  discussions in Uruguay and elsewhere in the cause of fairer and  freer trade. We hope that these discussions will continue so  that the issues of trade subsidies and particularly  agricultural trade reform can be dealt with on a basis which is  

 fair and realistic. We also hope that the spirit which  prevailed in Uruguay will continue to be applied to the other  great problem for many developing countries: the scope and terms  of their formidable debt.

 â¢w

 Let me say that the Auetralian Government supports the thrust of   the Baker propoaalo for solution of this problem. We also   support the general approach of the IMF to adjustment and   conditionality, noting that it should continue to be handled   with care. Democratic inetitutione, eometimea at.delicate  

 stages of development, should not be undermined by the process».   The economic benefits of conditionality hove to be balanced   against their potential for caueing social distress and   dislocation. There ie not a lot of profit (either for debtors   or creditors) in encouraging economic activity in nations whose  

 export marKete are closed off by trade-subsidisation and other   proteotioniet policies. On both the trade .reform and debt   adjustment ieeuee, the lessons of the events of 50 or 60 years   ago should be ominously c l e a n  the results when nations refuse  

 to co-operate can be devastating.

 No solutions to great economic problems will work if they do not   have the approbation and support of those who are affected by   them. No order can endure unless those who are subject to it   believe themselves to have a stake in it. This principle  

 applies to other matters on the agenda of this Organisation in   which Australia has a special interest. It is why the   Australian Government continues to condemn the occupation off   Afghanistan. It is the reason for our continuing denunciation  

 of Vietnam’s occupation of Cambodia and the atrocities committed   in Cambodia by the leadership of the Khmer Rouge, Human   freedoms and the agreement of the governed are at the heart of   the divisions between the people of North and South Korea. The   UN once went to war over these divisions. It seems only  

 sensible that, by admitting both North and South Korea, the UN   should promote the contact and dialogue that will help heal   them. .

 Freedom and the agreement of the governed are highly significant   factors in a matter which is of special concern" to Australia and   our Pacific neighbors: New Caledonia. Australia would like to   see New Caledonia join the community of independent nations in  

 the South Pacific as soon as it is realistically possible, with   a system of multiracial independence which recognises the rights   of the indigenous Kanak people and other long-term residents and   which maintains the support and goodwill of France (a point .   .which I have made repeatedly to my good friends in the Kanak  

 movement). Australia supports the call by South Pacific Forum   countries for reinscribing New Caledonia on the UN list of   non-self-governing territories and we and our South Pacific   neighbours will work to do so at this session. ^We believe that  

 it will enable progress towards self-government and

 6

 independence,  through constructive dialogue with all parties  involved (including the French Government) to be reviewed  regularly by this Organisation.

 Freedom and participation are central also in two issues which  concern Australia because of their capacity to threaten  international peace. I refer to the continuing and  deteriorating situations in South Africa and the Middle East. The Australian Government believes that the system by which 

 South Africa is governed represents precisely that which the UN  was designed to oppose: institutional inequity, injustice,  violence, oppression and discrimination. It is surprising  therefore that the South African situation has not been treated 

 in all the statements made by members to this session so far for  what it really is: a threat to fundamental UN values. The  Australian Government's disgust with the system of government in   South Africa and her continuing illegal occupation of Namibia is  

 well known and needs no explanation here. We genuinely want to  see apartheid eliminated quickly and peacefully before it  plunges the region and beyond into wider conflict. Australia  and other Commonwealth countries have tried to persuade South  Africa to set such basic reform in train, but without  success. We believe that the UN should set up a mandatory  system of concerted and coherent sanctions which would pressure 

 South Africa into real reform. Certainly, those members who  cannot or will not adopt sanctions policies should refrain (or   be discouraged by this Organisation) from taking commercial  advantage of those who can.

 Already in this debate, we have heard expressions of hope that  some progress might be made in 1987 towards finding a solution  of the intractable problems of the Middle East, Ae a country  which has drawn new settlers from diverse parts of the Middle 

 East, which contributes to United Nations peacekeeping efforts,  which in simple human terms has not failed to be touched by the  plight of refugees and the results of conflict and terrorism,  Australia shares this hope. Progress can be made only if 

 compromises and accommodations oan be reached which take into  account the rights and aspirations of all those involved.

 President Roosevelt saw the UN as a replacement for exclusive  alliances, spheres of influence and other failed expedients. On  the one hand, at the time stood the untrammelled influence of  the victorious powers and, on the other, the dispossessed,  It  

 fell to the UN to try to fill the vacuum of authority between  them. There are many who would say that this pattern has not  changed in any substantial way. Certainly, theiAustralian  Government sees this Organisation as the only viable alternative 

 to the authority that had prevailed previouoly, very often to  the great detriment of huge numbers of humankind: the power of

 the face that tne world i b ac « ecagc in u «  history where fewer   problems can be solved by national measures alone, confidence   seems to have lessened in international organisations.  Reliance   on unilateral action aeeras more attractive to some people.

 The Australian Government has some understanding with the   impatience expressed about the UN and its operations. We would   argue that there is room for more efficient administration of   the Organisation, leas wasteful duplication of function and   operation and a more rational decision-making process for its   budget. In view of its high mission and the poverty and  

 exploitation against which it is struggling, it is quite wrong   that the UN should be in any way an example of conspicuous   consumption.  In view of the high expectations of it in every   part or the world, it would Le a  oli«iu degenerate into a broadcasting agency for pointless, meaningless   and ultimately useless declarations. Australia is among the   vanguard of those who seek to make the Security Council more   effective. It should be allowed to act more flexibly, for   instance; to practise more of a mediatory or preventive role. It should be allowed to work more closely with the   Secr e t a r y - G e n e r a l . I use the word "allowed" deliberately   because it is clear that the Council is inhibited by two   factorsi the trend which has turned it into a kind of   raini-General Assembly and the failure of the Permanent Members   always to remember the greater responsibility which goes with   their privileged position. Australia will assist the   Secretary-General in his aim of making the UN a more effective   organisation as energetically and positively as it can. It would be quite wrong to infer from this, h o w e v e r , that the   Australian Government has any sympathy with those who act to   diminish the UN itself and its various organisations. The UN   has the firm support of the A u s t r a l i a n  G o v e r n m e n t . It should   not be allowed to become the scapegoat because individual   members fail to subsume their national interests. As Dag ,   Hammarskjold once said, this is like blaming the storm on the   ship. The fact is that the UN is no better or worse than the   countries which control its purse strings. If member states   have cause to quarrel with UN procedures or if large nations are   frustrated because of the way small nations use the system, the   solution is to stay and help the fight for sensible reform, not   to walk away from the problem. ,  . .  , .. There are many thousands (even millions) of people who owe their   she l t e r , their food, their schooling and even their survival to   organisations of the UN. The UN has achieved steady progress on   a whole range of practical m a t t e r s : environmental c o n t r o l , for 8 instance j  conditions of work; literacy; the codification of law;   the orderly management of transport and communications.  it hae  been instrumental in winning and protecting individual and  national freedoms. It has helped keep the peace between  nations. It hae promoted in people's consciousness the gravity  and potential for destruction of the great scourges of  humankindi oppression of individuals; poverty end the wantage of   resources; the causes of war. It has established and defended a   moral climate for the conduct of international affairs. It has  become the main platform and protector - for many people,  the  only platform and protector - for those who feel strong ae  members of the international community, but weak when left to  operate alone. I am not so unwise as to exaggerate Australia's influence on  these matters. But I do speak as the representative of a nation  which feels strongly aoout threats to the capacity of the UN to   maintain and defend the rights of individuals and nations in a   just and effective world order.  I reiterate the pledge given by  the Australian Government to the 40th Assemblyi of active,  committed and profound loyalty to the UN and its ideals.  Our  Government feels very strongly that the Organisation is in  danger so long as it refuses or postpones reform. But it  believes equally strongly that there is no substitute for the UN  in a multilateral system of co-operative management of global  problems and maintenance of- world peace. Thank you, Mr President.
