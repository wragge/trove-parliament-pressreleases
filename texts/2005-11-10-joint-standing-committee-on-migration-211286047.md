  PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA  JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION  Chair - Mr Don Randall MP  Deputy - Senator Linda Kirk 

  Public hearings in Adelaide and Perth  for Overseas Skills Recognition inquiry  The Joint Standing Committee on Migration will be holding public hearings in Adelaide and  Perth next week as part of its inquiry into skills recognition, upgrading and licensing. 

  "The Committee is interested in hearing from organisations and individuals in Adelaide and  Perth to see if the current skills recognition processes are functioning efficiently, or need to be  improved." Committee Chairman, Don Randall MP said. 

  The Committee is looking at skills recognition not only for migrants, but also for those who come  to Australia outside the skilled migration system, such as temporary residents needing skills  assessment and Australian citizens returning to Australia with overseas qualifications. 

  In addition, the Committee is comparing Australia's overseas skills recognition arrangements  with those of other major immigration countries and whether greater consistency in the  recognition of qualifications might be achieved among Australian states and territories.
