 Australia assists displaced people on Thai Burma border

 Australia will provide $200,000 in relief assistance to Burmese minority groups on the Thai Burma border, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 There are currently an estimated 65,000 displaced people, mainly Burmese ethnic minorities, in camps along the Thai Burma border.

 "There have been disturbing allegations of the Burmese Army mistreating the ethnic groups, in particular those moving from areas where military operations are being conducted against insurgents, "Mr Kerin said.

 "These allegations include claims of murder, rape, torture and forced labour. The Australian Ambassador has made representations to Burmese authorities to convey Australia's concerns about the allegations."

 There have also been reports of massive troop build-ups along the border, particularly in the Manerplaw region. Refugee numbers are increasing in the wake of heavy fighting.

 "Access to the camps is difficult, with some being impossible to reach in the rainy season. It is imperative that supplies be put in place before the monsoon sets in," Mr Kerin said.

 The relief assistance will be channelled through Australian non government organisations. $100,000 has been provided to the Archbishop of Sydney's Overseas Relief and Development Program and $100,000 to the Australian Council of Churches for relief assistance through the Burma Border Consortium.

 Emergency assistance for displaced Burmese is administered by AIDAB, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, as part of the Australian development cooperation program.
