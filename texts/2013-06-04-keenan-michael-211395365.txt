 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling MINISTER O’CONNOR WHICH STATEMENT  IS CORRECT? June 04, 2013

 Today in Question Time the Minister for Immigration, Brendan O’Connor, has refuted his own statement on the status of  assessment for the convicted Egyptian terrorist, who was kept in the low security family detention facility in the Adelaide  Hills, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said. 

 “In Question Time today the Minister for Immigration told the House that “there has been no assessment in relation to this  matter” which was in contradiction to his letter to me on 10th May on the same case, where he said, “The assessments of  the protection claims for these three individuals are being progressed by the department”.

 “Which statement is correct Minister? Has the Egyptian jihadist terrorist’s application for refugee status been progressed  or not?

 “The Coalition is calling on the Minister for Immigration to clarify his contradictory statements and to provide the Australian  people with the answers they deserve.

 “The Coalition has renewed our request for a briefing again today, in the hope that the Government will be forthcoming in  answers to the questions that we have been seeking for over a month now,” Mr Keenan said.
