 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 9 October 2012 

 

 PAPUA NEW GUINEA DESIGNATED FOR REGIONAL  PROCESSING   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, has this morning  signed the legislative instrument designating Papua New Guinea (PNG) as a regional  processing country under the Migration Act.   

 Mr Bowen said he will table the designation documents in Parliament today.    

 “Subject to both houses of Parliament passing a resolution approving the  designation, the designation will allow for the transfer of irregular maritime arrivals  who arrived after 13 August to PNG,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “These documents outline the terms of agreement with the PNG Government and  the fact I have now designated PNG as a regional processing country.”   

 The Minister has determined that it is in the national interest to begin transferring  people to PNG as set out in the Statement of Reasons, including:   

 ï· PNG has given Australia the assurances around the principle of non-refoulement and the assessment of asylum claims in line with the Refugee  Convention;  ï· Designating PNG as a regional processing country will discourage irregular 

 and dangerous maritime voyages and thereby reduce the risk of the loss of  life at sea;  ï· The designation promotes the maintenance of a fair and orderly refugee and  humanitarian program that retains the confidence of the Australian people;  ï· Designating PNG as a regional processing country promotes regional 

 cooperation on irregular migration and people smuggling and its undesirable  consequences; and  ï· Arrangements already in place in PNG and those that are proposed to be put  in place are satisfactory. 

 

 “The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Expert  Panel on Asylum Seekers,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “The designation tabled today is another step in implementing the comprehensive  and integrated approach to irregular maritime arrivals, as recommended by the  Expert Panel.”   

 The update Memorandum of Understanding with the PNG Government was signed on  8 September this year. Further announcements about processing arrangements in  PNG will be made in due course.   

 The Papua New Guinea Designation and Statement of Reasons are attached.

 INSTRUMENT OF DESIGNATION OF   THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS A  REGIONAL PROCESSING COUNTRY UNDER SUBSECTION 198AB(1)  OF THE MIGRATION ACT 1958 

 

 

 I, CHRIS BOWEN, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, acting under  subsection 198AB(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (“the Act”), thinking it is in the  national interest to do so, DESIGNATE that the Independent State of Papua New  Guinea is a regional processing country.

 NOTE: Subsection 198AB(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may, by legislative instrument, designate that a country is a  regional processing country. Subsection 198AB(2) of the Act provides that the only condition for the exercise of the power  under subsection (1) is that the Minister thinks that it is in the national interest to designate the country to be a regional  processing country. Subsection 198AB(3) of the Act, provides that in considering the national interest for the purposes of  subsection (2), the Minister: (a) must have regard to whether or not the country has given Australia any assurances to the effect  that: (i) the country will not expel or return a person taken to the country under section 198AD to another country where his or  her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social  group or political opinion; and (ii) the country will make an assessment, or permit an assessment to be made, of whether or not a  person taken to the country under that section is covered by the definition of refugee in Article 1A of the Refugees Convention  as amended by the Refugees Protocol and: (b) may have regard to any other matter, which in the opinion of the Minister, relates  to the national interest.

 STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THINKING THAT IT IS IN THE 

 NATIONAL INTEREST TO DESIGNATE THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF 

 PAPUA NEW GUINEA TO BE A REGIONAL PROCESSING COUNTRY 

 

 THE DESIGNATION 

 1. I,  CHRIS  BOWEN  MP,  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  have  

 exercised my power under s 198AB(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) to 

 designate  that  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  is  a  

 regional processing country. 

 2. This  document  sets  out  my  reasons  for  thinking  that  it  is  in  the  national  

 interest to designate PNG to be a regional processing country.  

 THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 

 3. The  power  conferred  on  me  by  s  198AB(1)  to  designate  that  a  country  is  a  

 regional processing country is contained in Part 2 Division 8 Subdivision B of 

 the  Act.  That  Subdivision  was introduced  into  the  Act  by  the  Migration 

 Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 

 (the  Amendment  Act).  Section  198AA  states  that  the  Subdivision  was  

 enacted because Parliament considers that: 

  (a) people  smuggling,  and  its  undesirable  consequences   including the resulting loss of life at sea, are major regional  problems that need to be addressed; and 

 (b) offshore  entry persons, including offshore  entry persons  in   respect  of  whom Australia  has  or  may  have  protection   obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by  the  Refugees  Protocol,  should  be  able  to  be  taken  to  any    country designated to be a regional processing country; 

 (c) it  is  a  matter  for  the  Minister  and  Parliament  to  decide   which countries should be designated as regional processing  countries; and  

 (d) the  designation  of  a  country  to  be  a  regional  processing   country  need  not  be  determined  by  reference  to  the   international obligations or domestic law of that country. 

 

 

 3 

 4. Subsection 198AB(2) provides that the only condition for the exercise of the 

 power  conferred  on  me  by  s  198AB(1)  is  that  I  think  it  is  in  the  national  

 interest to designate the country to be a regional processing country. 

 5. Subsection 198AB(3) provides that, in considering the national interest for the 

 purposes of s 198AB(2), I must have regard to whether or not the country has 

 given Australia any assurances to the effect that: 

 (i)  the  country  will  not  expel  or  return  a  person  taken  to  the   country under section 198AD to another country where his  or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his  or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular  social group or political opinion; and 

 (ii)  the country will make an assessment, or permit an assessment to be  made,  of  whether  or  not  a  person  taken  to  the  country  under  that   section is covered by the definition of refugee in Article 1A of the  Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; 

 and I may have regard to any other matter which in my opinion relates to the 

 national interest. 

 6. Subsection  198AB(4)  provides  that  the  assurances  referred  to  in  s 198AB(3) 

 need not be legally binding. 

 7. Section 198AD of the Act has the effect that, subject to ss 198AE, 198AF and 

 198AG,  an  officer  must,  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable,  take  an  offshore 

 entry  person  who  is  detained  under  s  189  from  Australia  to  a  regional  

 processing country. Section 198AE confers on me a personal non-compellable 

 power  to  determine  in  writing  that  s  198AD  does  not  apply  to  an  offshore  

 entry person, if I think that it is in the public interest to do so. Section 198AF 

 provides that s 198AD does not apply to an offshore entry person if there is no 

 regional  processing  country.  And  s  198AG  provides  that  s  198AD  does  not  

 apply to an offshore entry person if the regional  processing country, or each 

 regional  processing  country  (if  there  is  more  than  one  such  country),  has  

 advised an officer in writing that the country will not accept the offshore entry 

 person.

 BACKGROUND 

 8. On 28 June 2012, the Prime Minister appointed an independent expert panel 

 (the panel)  to  provide  advice  and  recommendations  to  the  Government  on  

 policy  options  available  to  prevent  asylum  seekers  risking  their  lives  on  

 dangerous  boat  journeys  to  Australia.   The  panel  consisted  of  Air  Chief  

 Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC (Retired), Mr Paris Aristotle AM, Director 

 of  the  Victorian  Foundation  for  Survivors  of  Torture  Inc  and  Professor  

 Michael L’Estrange AO, Director, National Security College.  

 9. The  panel  consulted  widely  on  asylum  issues  with  political  leaders,  other 

 members  of  the  Parliament,  agencies  and  departments  of  Government,  non-government organisations, academics and other experts as well as those in the 

 wider  community.   The  panel  also  held  discussions  with  representatives  of  

 some  refugee  communities  in  Australia  and  refugees  who  travelled  to  

 Australia through irregular means.  The panel received more than 550 written 

 submissions. 

 10. The  panel  released  its  report  on  13  August  2012.   The  panel  recommended, 

 among other things, that “a capacity be established in PNG as soon as possible 

 to  process  the  claims  of  IMAs  [irregular  maritime  arrivals]  transferred  from  

 Australia  in  ways  consistent  with the  responsibilities  of  Australia  and  PNG 

 under international law”.  

 11. Following  the  report  of  the  panel,  the  Government  introduced  the  Migration 

 Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012.  

 That  Bill  passed  both  Houses  of  Parliament  with  the  support  of  both  the  

 Government and the Opposition. 

 SUBMISSION  

 12. To  facilitate  my  consideration  of  whether  I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  

 interest  to  designate  PNG  to  be  a  regional  processing  country,  a  submission  

 was  provided  to  me  by  my  Department,  which  included  the  following  

 attachments: 

 

 

 5 

 (1) Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  the  Government  of  the  

 Independent  State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Government 

 of  Australia,  relating  to  the  transfer  to  and  assessment  of  persons  in  

 Papua  New  Guinea,  and  related  matters,  which  was  signed  on  8 

 September 2012 (the MOU) (Attachment A) 

 (2) a statement about arrangements that are in place, and are to be put in 

 place, in PNG for the treatment of persons taken there under s 198AD 

 of the Act (the statement of arrangements) (Attachment B) 

 MY REASONS 

 13. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  designate  PNG  to  be  a  regional  

 processing country (notwithstanding that I have previously designated Nauru  

 to be a regional processing country), because: 

 (1) PNG has given Australia the assurances referred to in s 198AB(3)(a)(i) 

 and (ii) of the Act and other assurances; 

 (2) I  consider  designating  PNG  to  be  a  regional  processing  country  will  

 discourage  irregular  and  dangerous  maritime  voyages  and  thereby  

 reduce the risk of the loss of life at sea; 

 (3) I  consider  designating  PNG  to  be  a  regional  processing  country  will  

 promote  the  maintenance  of  a  fair  and  orderly  Refugee  and  

 Humanitarian  Program  that  retains  the  confidence  of  the  Australian  

 people; 

 (4) I  consider  designating  PNG to  be  a  regional  processing  country will 

 promote  regional  co-operation in  relation  to  irregular  migration and 

 address people smuggling and its undesirable consequences; 

 (5) I consider the arrangements that are already in place in PNG, and that 

 are proposed to be put in place in PNG, to be satisfactory.  

 

 

 6 

 14. It is my opinion that, in addition to the assurances to which I must have regard 

 pursuant to s 198AB(3), each of the other matters referred to in the preceding 

 paragraph relates to the national interest.  

 Assurances by PNG 

 15. As stated above, s 198AB(3) provides that, in considering the national interest 

 for  the  purposes  of  s  198AB(2),  I  must  have  regard  to  whether  or  not  the  

 country has given Australia any assurances to the effect set out in paragraph 5 

 above. 

 16. PNG has given those assurances. They are contained in clause 18 of the MOU. 

 I consider that the “Transferees” who are referred to in clause 18 of the MOU 

 are people who will be taken to PNG pursuant to s 198AD of the Act. 

 17. In  relation  to  the  assurance  referred  to  in  paragraph  5(ii)  above,  the  PNG  

 Government  has  advised  the  Commonwealth  that  refugee  status  

 determinations for transferees will be made under PNG law with reference to 

 Article 1A of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. 

 18. PNG has  given an additional  assurance in clause  18 of the MOU that it will 

 not  send  a  transferee  to  another country  where  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the  

 transferee will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 

 or  punishment,  arbitrary  deprivation  of  life  of  the  imposition  of  the  death  

 penalty. 

 19. Whether or not the assurances referred to above are legally binding, I expect 

 that  PNG  will  act  in  accordance  with  them  and  that,  as  a  consequence,  

 offshore entry persons who are transferred to PNG will not be at risk of being 

 sent  to  another  country where  they have  a  well  founded  fear  of  persecution,  

 and will have any claims that they may make to be refugees within Article 1A 

 of the Refugee Convention assessed.  That was part of my thinking as to why 

 it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  designate  PNG  to  be  a  regional  processing  

 country. 

 

 

 7 

 Discouragement of irregular and dangerous maritime voyages 

 20. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  take  action  that  is  directed  to  

 discouraging  irregular  and  dangerous  maritime  voyages  to  Australia  and  

 thereby to reducing the risk of loss of life at sea.  In my view, s 198AA(a) of 

 the Act supports that conclusion. 

 21. I think that designating PNG to be a regional processing country may act as a 

 circuit  breaker  in  relation  to  the  recent  surge  in  the  number  of  irregular  and  

 dangerous maritime voyages to Australia. The surge in arrivals is indicated by 

 the following figures my Department has provided to me: 

 (1) From  2002  to  2008  there  were  fewer  than  10  boats  a  year.  The  total  

 number of passengers was fewer than 200 each year. 

 (2) In 2009, there were 60 boats carrying 2,726 passengers. 

 (3) In 2010, there were 134 boats carrying 6,555 passengers. 

 (4) In 2011, there were 69 boats carrying 4,565 passengers. 

 (5) In the year to 2012 to 2 October (inclusive), there have been 173 boats 

 carrying  11,233  passengers.  The  number  of  offshore  entry  persons  

 who arrived  in  Australia  in  the  first  seven  months  of  2012   (7,120 - 

 made up of 6,943 passengers and 177 crew) exceeded the number who 

 arrived in total in each of 2011 and 2010.  The number of passengers 

 who  arrived  in  September 2012  (2,293)  constituted  the  largest  ever  

 monthly number and was the largest ever number for the sixth month 

 in a row, since 2008. 

 22. A substantial number of lives have been lost at sea as a result of the activities 

 of  people  smugglers.   As  reported  by  the  Expert  Panel,  since 2001,  it  is  

 estimated that 1064 passengers have died (or gone missing, presumed dead).   

 Of  these,  704  deaths  have  occurred  since  October  2009.   The  figures  above  

 include the tragedy on 30 August 2012, during which an estimated 100 people 

 lost their lives following the sinking of a vessel some 42 nautical miles off the 

 Indonesian coast.  

 

 

 8 

 23. I  think  that  the  cost  of  irregular  maritime  voyages,  in  terms  of  the  loss  of  

 human life and in respect  of the substantial  financial  and resourcing costs  to 

 the Commonwealth in dealing with such arrivals (estimated to be in excess of 

 $5 billion over the forward estimates period), means that it is in the national 

 interest  to  attempt  to  reduce  the  number  of  such  voyages,  and  to  do  so  

 urgently. 

 24. I think that, as people who are considering travelling to Australia on irregular 

 maritime voyages become aware that their protection claims may be assessed 

 in either Nauru or PNG, they may be discouraged from risking their lives by 

 so  doing,  because  it  will  change  the  equation  between  risk  and  reward  for 

 prospective IMAs. 

 I  also  think  that  designating  PNG  to  be  a  regional  processing  country  will  make  it  

 more difficult for people smugglers to sell the opportunity to resettle in Australia. 

 Maintenance of a fair and orderly Refugee and Humanitarian Program 

 25. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  take  action  that  will  promote  the  

 maintenance  of  a  fair  and  orderly  Refugee  and  Humanitarian  Program  that  

 retains the confidence of the Australian people. 

 26. Many of the people who  arrive in Australia as IMAs are refugees within  the 

 meaning of Article 1A of the Refugees  Convention.  But many persons who  

 need protection  under  that  Convention  are  also  located  outside  Australia.   

 While the Australian Government has recently increased the number of visas 

 available under its Refugee and Humanitarian Program each year, that number 

 remains limited.  The policy of successive governments has been that grants of 

 visas to both offshore and onshore refugees, including those who have arrived 

 as  IMAs  as  a  result  of  the  activities  of  people  smugglers,  are required  to  be  

 within this limit.  As a result, for each visa granted to an onshore claimant in a 

 given  year,  there  is  one  less  visa  available  to  be  granted  to  an  offshore  

 claimant  in  that  year.   In  2011-2012,  for  the  first  time more  visas  were  

 granted to onshore claimants  than to offshore claimants, shifting the balance 

 of the program from its traditional offshore focus. 

 

 

 9 

 27. The designation of PNG as a regional processing country will have the effect 

 that  officers  will  be  obliged  to take  offshore  entry persons  who  are  detained  

 under  s  189  of  the  Act  from  Australia  to  either  PNG  or  Nauru  as  soon  as  

 reasonably practicable (unless I exercise my personal non-compellable power 

 under s 198AE). For that reason, I consider that the designation of PNG to be 

 a regional processing country is likely to reduce the level of irregular maritime 

 arrivals to Australia and have the effect that a greater proportion of visas will 

 be  given  to  offshore  claimants  than  is  presently  the  case.   I  think  that  this 

 would result in a fairer and more orderly Refugee and Humanitarian Program, 

 and one which is more likely to retain the confidence of the Australian people. 

 This is because I think that the allocation of protection visas to refugees under 

 Australia’s Refugee and Humanitarian Program should not be determined by 

 whether  or  not  the  refugee  has  undertaken  an  irregular  and  dangerous  

 maritime voyage to Australia.  

 Promotion of regional co-operation 

 28. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  take  action  that  will  promote  

 regional  co-operation  in  relation  to  addressing  people  smuggling  and  its  

 undesirable consequences. 

 29. Irregular migration is a continuing challenge for  the Asia-Pacific  region.   At 

 the  Fourth  Ministerial  Conference  of  the  Bali  Process  on  People  Smuggling, 

 Trafficking  and  Related  Transnational  Crime  held  in  Indonesia  on  29-30 

 March 2011, Ministers agreed to a regional cooperation framework that would 

 provide  a  more  effective  way  for  interested  states  to  cooperate  to  reduce  

 irregular  migration  in  the  region.   That  framework  was  to  be  given  effect  

 through arrangements entered into on a bilateral or sub-regional basis. 

 30. I think  that  the  designation  of  PNG as  a  regional  processing  country  will  

 encourage  the  development  of  further  regionally  integrated  arrangements  to  

 address the humanitarian and other problems caused by people smuggling, by 

 providing  a  practical  demonstration  of  regional  co-operation  to  address  

 irregular migration. 

 

 

 10 

 Arrangements 

 31. I  think  that  the  arrangements  that  are  in  place  and  are  to  be put  in  place,  in  

 PNG  for  the  treatment  of  persons  taken  to  PNG  - being  the  arrangements  

 described in the statement of arrangements - are satisfactory.  

 32. I am aware that: 

 (1) some aspects of the arrangements that it is proposed would operate in 

 PNG if  I designate PNG to  be  a  regional  processing  country are  still  

 the subject of negotiation between the Commonwealth and PNG;  

 (2) work  is  still  continuing  to  establish  the  accommodation  and  other  

 facilities that will be available to Transferees taken to PNG. 

 These facts do not alter my view as to the national interest. 

 International obligations 

 33. If PNG is  designated as  a  regional  processing  country  it  will  follow,  as  is 

 noted  in  s  198AA(b), that offshore  entry  persons,  including  offshore entry 

 persons in respect of whom Australia has or may have protection obligations 

 under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol, may be 

 taken to PNG. 

 34. The  content  of  Australia’s  international  obligations  is  contestable. In 

 particular, there  is  a  range  of  views  held  by  lawyers,  academics, non-government  organisations  and  others  as  to  the  content  of  Australia’s  

 international  obligations  with  respect  to  persons  transferred  to  another  

 country, some of which differ from the Department’s position. 

 35. On the basis of the material set out in the submission from the Department, I 

 think  that  it  is  not  inconsistent  with  Australia’s  international  obligations  

 (including  but  not  limited  to  Australia’s  obligations  under  the  Refugees 

 Convention)  to  designate  PNG as  a  regional  processing  country, 

 notwithstanding  that  this  will  create  a  duty  under  s  198AD  to  take  offshore  

 

 

 11 

 entry  persons  to  PNG in  some  circumstances (subject  to s  198AD(5)  and  to 

 the exercise of my personal non-compellable power in s 198AE). 

 36. However, even if the designation of PNG to be a regional processing country 

 is  inconsistent  with  Australia’s  international  obligations,  I nevertheless think 

 that it is in the national interest to designate PNG to be a regional processing 

 country.  

 37. In considering whether I think it is in the national interest to designate PNG to 

 be  a  regional  processing  country,  in  addition  to  the  matters  outlined  above  I 

 have chosen  not  to  have  regard  to  the  international  obligations  or  domestic  

 law of PNG. 

 Concluded opinion 

 38. In light of the matters identified above, I think that it is in the national interest 

 to designate PNG to be a regional processing country.
