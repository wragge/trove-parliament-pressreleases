 LIBERALS’ BUDGET: CUTS AID, CONSULAR HELP - PASSPORT FEES UP    

 The Liberals’ Budget looks after high income earners and big business, while cutting aid  to the world’s poor.      

 Since coming to Government in 2013, the Liberals have gutted Australia’s aid  program.  This Budget locks in their cuts.  Australia’s aid program is now the weakest in  history.   

 The Liberals have trashed Australia’s reputation as a good global citizen.     

 Labor has already announced measures designed to start to rebuild the ailing aid  program.   

 If elected, Labor will:   

 ï· prov ide $450 million to support the important work of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees, placing Australia in the top five global contributors;   

 ï· commit an extra $40 million a year to help some of the world’s poorest people,  including support for Australian NGOs working in developing countries to deliver  critical projects like maternal and child health, schooling, clean water, and  sanitation;   

 ï· legislate to restore accountability to Australia’s aid program by reintroducing the  a  nnual ministerial Budget statement on overseas aid, after it was axed by the 

 Liberals in 2014. Labor will release the statement at the same time as each  federal Budget to show how aid is allocated by sector, country, and region; and   

 ï· legislate for an independent evaluation of the Australia’s aid program, as well as  th  e measurement and reporting of effectiveness.   

 Labor’s proposals have been costed by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office,  and are fully offset.      

 The Liberals’ Budget also cuts consular support, which could see Australian dual  nationals left stranded overseas without help.  Dual nationals will no longer be entitled  to Australian consular assistance in countries of which they are citizens.  Labor is very  concerned by this move.     

 In addition, the Liberals’ Budget increases fees for ordinary passports which means  travel, for work or pleasure, will cost Australians more.
