 The Hon Stephen Smith MP  AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 12 June 2009  

 Visit to Australia by Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs  

 Kenya's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Moses Wetang'ula, is visiting Australia from  Thursday 11 to Tuesday 16 June.  

 I will meet with Mr Wetang'ula in Perth today Friday 12 June. Mr Wetang'ula will also visit  Melbourne and Canberra.  

 I previously met with Mr Wetang'ula in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in January this year.  

 Mr Wetang'ula's visit is a significant moment in Australia's relationship with Kenya. While  Mr Wetang'ula has visited Australia before, it is his first official visit as Foreign Minister.  

 It is the first official bilateral visit to Australia by a Kenyan Foreign Minister.  

 Kenya has traditionally been one of Australia's closest friends in Africa. Our warm bilateral  relations are founded on shared Commonwealth membership and interests, cooperation in the  United Nations and significant commercial ties and people-to-people links.  

 Mr Wetang'ula's visit provides an opportunity for Kenya and Australia to explore further  bilateral trade and investment, particularly in the minerals and petroleum resources industries.  

 Mr Wetang'ula will be joined in Perth by Kenya's Minister for Environment and Mineral  Resources, Mr John Michuki. Mr Wetang'ula and Mr Michuki will meet with industry and  government to help build commercial links between our two countries.  

 Regional peace and security issues, including Somalia, Sudan and Zimbabwe, will be  important items for discussion. Kenya is making a strong contribution to African efforts to  resolve the crises in Somalia and Sudan.  

 Kenya is also playing a strong role in international efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of  Africa, including trying pirates detained by international forces in the Gulf of Aden.  

 Australia is also contributing to these international efforts, providing a frigate and AP-3C  maritime patrol aircraft currently based in the Middle East.  

 Australia will provide $500,000, as well as skills and expertise, to the Joint European  Commission/United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) Counter Piracy Program  to assist Kenyan authorities in receiving and processing apprehended piracy suspects.  

 Kenya is a significant partner for Australia's aid program in Africa, particularly in the  delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Horn of Africa.  

 As part of Australia's growing scholarships program, Kenya will receive fourteen post-graduate scholarships next year.  

 The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that Kenya is currently home to  around 350,000 refugees, most driven from neighbouring countries such as Somalia and  Sudan by instability and humanitarian crises.  

 Australia will provide $4 million to help Kenya respond to this influx of refugees. This will  include food assistance and support for refugee programs delivered through the United  Nations.
