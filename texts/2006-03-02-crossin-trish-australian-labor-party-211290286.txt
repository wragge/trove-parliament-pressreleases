 Senate Report calls for overhaul of Migration Act  

 and greater scrutiny of Ministerial Responsibilities. 

 

 A Senate report tabled this afternoon has called for a complete review of the Migration Act and Regulations to  be undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission. 

 Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, Senator Trish Crossin, said: “The committee agrees  with the evidence we received that the Migration Act has become too complex and an unwieldy monster." 

 "The Act should be reviewed as a matter of priority with a view to establishing a regime that is fair, transparent  and legally defensible.” 

 The report has also called for greater Ministerial accountability and recommended that the terms of reference  for any future inquiry into this area provide authority to investigate the actions of both the Minister and the  office. 

 “It is no longer appropriate that the Minister be allowed to remain at arms length from these processes and be  excluded from any scrutiny or accountability.” 

 The report makes 61 recommendations that include:  

 â¢ Introducing a new system of complementary protection for future asylum seekers who do not meet the  definition of refugee under the Refugee Convention, 

 â¢ An independent investigation by the Ombudsman or HREOC into the use of detainee labour, and  providing HREOC with a statutory right to access to all detention places, 

 â¢ Closing detention centre ‘management units’, 

 â¢ Returning direct responsibility for the management and provisions of services at detention centres back  to the Commonwealth, 

 â¢ Section 501 should not be used to cancel permanent residency for those people who arrived as minors  and have been here more than ten years. 

 "Despite the recommendations of the Palmer and Comrie report, the Committee continued to hear evidence  that here still existed a culture of imbalance, rigid attitudes and process. Not only does the Act need changing  but the administration and operation still needs a major overhaul."
