 Media Release 

 Rudd smashes boat record - over 4,000 people illegally arrive in July 

 Wednesday 31st July 2013 

 The arrival of another illegal boat, this time with 104 people on board, has seen Kevin Rudd set yet another 

 record of failure on our borders with over 4,000 people illegally arriving in July - the first full month since his 

 reappointment as Prime Minister, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Kevin Rudd has reached a level of failure that even Julia Gillard couldn’t match - having presided over the 

 arrival of more than 4,000 people on illegal boats in a single month,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “People smugglers have got back the Prime Minister who re-started their business model when he 

 dismantled the Coalition’s proven border protection policies and they are taking full advantage, sending an 

 average of more than 130 people a day to Australia by boat this month. 

 “This latest boat means over 1,500 people have arrived since Kevin Rudd announced his PNG election fix 

 - over half the capacity that the PNG Government said would not be in place until the end of the year. 

 “Kevin Rudd is the guilty party when it comes to Labor’s border protection failures and he should not be 

 rewarded for his failure,” Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “Another illegal boat has been intercepted, carrying 104 people, as July holds the new 

 record for most people arriving by boat ever in a month - with 46 boats carrying 4,077 people. 

 “More people have already arrived by boat this year than the entire amount of illegal arrivals last year - this 

 is despite 2012 being the biggest year for people arriving by boat ever on record. 

 “People smugglers do not take this Government seriously because their track record of incompetence 

 when it comes to border protection speaks volumes. 

 “It is time Mr Rudd called an election to give the Australian people the opportunity to judge him on his 

 border protection failures,” Mr Keenan said.
