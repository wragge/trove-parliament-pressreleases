 1986-87 GRANTS FOR MIGRANT WELFARE SERVICES

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Chris Hurford,   today announced Federal Government Grants-in-Aid for migrant   welfare services totalling $2.43 million. The funding provides   for 66 full grants and 15 half grants in 1986-87.

 Mr Hur ford said each grant would cover the cost of employing a   specialist social or welfare worker who would help migrants and   ethnic communities to become self-reliant.

 In determining this year's allocation, Mr Hurford said, a total   of 207 applications were assessed.  .

 "The assessment process aims to allocate funds according to   need, as identified by the objectives of the Grant-in-Aid   Scheme," he said.  "  â 

 "These objectives are both short and long-term.

 "in the immediate future, the Scheme seeks to redress some of   the·disadvantages experienced by migrants and their communities.

 "In the longer term, we are aiming to ensure that migrants have   equal access to the resources of the whole community and that   they are involved in determining the nature of those resources."

 Mr Hur ford said the grants were part of an established network   of grants across Australia which covered all migrant groups,   and together were worth some $6.73 million a year.

 "The grants are keenly competed for by migrant groups, "he said.

 "They are seen to have particular value in helping migrants to   identify needs and develop a capacity to meet those needs '   during their period of adjustment to their new life in   Australia." ’  ~

 Mr Hurford said the distribution of grants among the States was   approximately in line with the distribution of the non-English   speaking born population of Australia.

 The Minister indicated that, with the establishment of the   Office of Multicultural Affairs, it was intended that existing   arrangements for administering the Grant-in-Aid Scheme would be   reviewed. However, he said, it was expected that applications  

 for grants available next financial year would be invited   through public advertising in March 1987, and decisions   announced at the end of 1987.

 A full list of the new grants is attached.
