  Contracts for migrant English tuition in Western Australia  Contracts worth a total of $28 million have been awarded for the delivery of the Adult Migrant  English Program (AMEP) in Western Australia over the next five years, the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today. 

  "English language ability is one of the key factors in the successful settlement of migrants into  our community," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "Studies have shown that migrants with a low level of English language skill tend to have a poor  employment experience and can face social isolation ." 

  The intention to go to an open tender process was announced in the 1996-97 Budget. 

  The new contracts , to take effect in January 1998, have been awarded to: 

   " North Metropolitan College (previously the State's sole AMEP provider);   " Central Metropolitan College; and   " Overseas Qualifications and Skills Recognition Unit of the Department of Training. 

  The tendering process reflects the Government's commitment to the delivery of high quality ,  flexible English language tuition to migrants and refugees through the AMEP. 

  "The Government's aim in moving to open tendering , was to improve flexibility and  effectiveness , while ensuring best value for money," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "The successful tenderers have developed strategies to meet the diverse language learning needs  of the State's new arrivals. 

  "The result is a service delivery model under which an independent service will assess clients'  language skills at registration and stream them to an appropriate tuition provider according to  their English language needs." 

  Those entering under the Refugee and Humanitarian stream will also have access to additional  preparatory tuition to prepare them for the courses.
