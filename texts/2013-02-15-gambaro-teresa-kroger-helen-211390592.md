 Government in disarray over $375M foreign aid ‘diversion’   

 Senior bureaucrats in the Gillard Government are in disarray as to who is administering the $375  million cut in foreign aid to fund Labor’s failed border security policies.   

 Under intense scrutiny from Senator Helen Kroger during Senate Estimates last night, AusAID  Director-General Peter Baxter confirmed there was significant confusion between AusAID and the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) as to which of the two agencies had responsibility  for the expenditure of $375 million hijacked from the foreign aid budget.   

 Senator Kroger made specific reference to evidence given by DIAC Secretary Martin Bowles during  Senate Estimates on Monday February 11 that AusAID was the responsible agency.   

 Senator Kroger asked Mr Baxter: “Given that Mr Bowles has clearly given evidence to suggest that  the accounting of the $375 million is the responsibility of AusAID, under the Department of Foreign  Affairs, do you believe that is your understanding of the situation?”   

 In response Mr Baxter replied: “No Senator, that is not my understanding … I think my colleague  might have been mistaken in the response he gave.”   

 Senator Kroger said the staggering lack of coordination across government as to how $375 million of  taxpayers’ money, previously earmarked for foreign aid, was to be “reprioritised” revealed an  “extraordinary level of incompetence”.   

 Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for International Development and Assistance, Teresa Gambaro,  said the pathetic buck-passing between these two senior bureaucrats was reflective of a government  in crisis.   

 “It is hard to believe that less than two years after the handing down of the Independent Review of  Aid Effectiveness that this level of ineptitude could exist. The Review was all about makes foreign aid  transparent and accountable. This level of incompetence makes a mockery of the whole review  process,” Ms Gambaro said.   

 AusAID was also forced to admit that the $375 million ‘diversion’ was the first time in Australian  history that the foreign aid budget had been used to fund onshore costs of asylum seekers.   

 Senator Kroger also highlighted Minister Carr’s inability to provide any clarity as to when the clock  started ticking on the OECD 12-month cap for charging domestic asylum seeker costs as foreign aid.   

 In reply to the question as to whether or not he was aware if the Government had considered this  issue, Minister Carr replied, “No, I’m not.”    

 Ms Gambaro said the failure to investigate this issue meant the Gillard Government was exposing  Australia’s foreign aid budget to further raids.
