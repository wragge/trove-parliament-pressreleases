 Ruddock Stands Firm on Illegal Arrivals MPS 043/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today confirmed the Government would maintain the measures it had introduced to combat people trafficking.

 The Minister also rejected State claims that the Commonwealth is cost-shifting the burden of providing services to refugees granted Temporary Protection Visas after they had arrived unlawfully.

 Mr Ruddock was responding to comments from State and Territory Ministers, at the Ministerial Council of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Wellington, New Zealand, calling for the suspension of three year Temporary Protection Visas (TPV).

 "I want to make very clear that we will not suspend this visa policy. That would only encourage illegal entrants and criminals and we will not back away from measures designed to act as a strong disincentive to illegal travel," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Government is committed to fight the heinous crime of people trafficking which has led to the unlawful arrival of more than 3,600 people in the past 10 months.

 "The States are wrong in claiming the Commonwealth is shifting the cost burden of providing services to TPV holders onto the states," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Government will meet international obligations in providing basic services to TPV holders who have arrived unlawfully. They are entitled to work, and if they meet the criteria, they are eligible for Special Benefit, rent assistance and family allowance, and are also covered by Medicare.

 However, additional settlement services provided for refugee and humanitarian entrants who are resettled lawfully, will not be available to those arriving unlawfully.

 "Because there is no expectation by the Commonwealth that the States provide these services, there is no cost shifting," Mr Ruddock said.

 "States have overlooked the fact that that the TPVs are counted as part of the

 12,000 places available under the Refugee and Humanitarian Program and so the number of people seeking services is not being expanded. "I am perplexed and disappointed that some States and Territories are proposing to provide more than the basic services envisaged. If they chose to do this, they should not be coming to the Commonwealth seeking extra funding.

 "I cannot understand why they would provide the additional services to the holders of TPVs and disadvantage other needy people in their community. It undermines the strong signal the Commonwealth is sending to people traffickers and people who would engage their services," Mr Ruddock said.
