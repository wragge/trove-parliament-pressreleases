 Cornelia Rau Case Spotlights Detention Policy

 Senator for South Australia Natasha Stott Despoja today criticised the Governments new type  of visa and its inhumane immigration detention policy.

 The new type of visa announced by the Government, the Removal Pending Bridging Visa, will  do little to assist asylum seekers, Senator Stott Despoja said.

 Although the new visa will allow those who qualify for it a brief reprieve from being locked up in  detention centres, it requires them to give up their legal rights; to not have visa applications or  appeals pending; to agree to return to their country of origin whenever the Government deems  fit; and, to report regularly to authorities.

 It is also disturbing that Australias longest serving detainee, Peter Qasim, will apparently not be  eligible for the new type of visa and thus remains indefinitely in detention.

 Mr Qasim, who is effectively stateless, has not committed any crime yet, he has been detained  for longer than some convicted rapists, Senator Stott Despoja said.

 Speaking at a rally for Cornelia Rau in Adelaide, Senator Stott Despoja said that like many  Australians, she was appalled by the bungling and heartlessness that occurred in the Cornelia  Rau case.

 I am also conscious of the fact that asylum seekers in detention are subject to the same brutal  and inhumane treatment every day, Senator Stott Despoja said.

 Every day, there are tragedies in detention centres. 

 The detention system is incompatible with human rights. To change that, we must dismantle the  system and put an end to mandatory detention, Senator Stott Despoja said.
