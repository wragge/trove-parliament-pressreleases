 AUSTRALIAN AID PROGRAM 1990-91

 Australian aid expenditure will increase by 1.6 per cent in real terms  in 1990-91. The 1990-91 budget of $1,266.8 million is estimated to  yield an Overseas Development Assistance/Gross National Product ratio of  0.33 per cent, the same as in 1989-90.

 Issuing details of the aid program in Canberra tonight, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, said the Government had  been able to provide additional funding to the aid budget, amounting to  $30.7 million above the 1990-91 forward estimate.

 The tight fiscal stance required in the current economic climate meant  it had not been possible to fully offset the impact of increased  payments of more than $100 million to the World Bank and Asian 

 Development Bank in 1990-91, and it had accordingly been necessary to  trim expenditure in a number of areas across the aid program.

 A small number of new initiatives were, nonetheless, able to be  introduced. Senator Evans announced the expansion of environmentally-  focused activities in the aid program, including an additional $5.2  million for international environment cooperation in areas such as  population, tropical forestry and climate change.  These would include 

 funding for a new three-year Tropical Forestry Action Plan in Papua New  Guinea.

 The Government would also increase funding for the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees and would provide $110 million over three  years for the second phase of a successful program of assistance to  Southern Africa. This would include assistance for newly-independent  Namibia, support for activities identified by the African National  Congress and other organisations in Southern Africa and continued 

 support for the Special Commonwealth Fund for Mozambique.

 Allowance had also been made for a possible contribution of $5 million  to a multilateral support package for Vietnam to help Vietnam normalise  relations with the International Monetary Fund. An additional $5 million  would be provided for programmed activities in PNG in recognition of the 

 special problems caused by the closure of the Bougainville mine.

 Senator Evans said that it remained his obective to raise the ODA/GNP  ratio to at least 0.4 per cent as soon as possible. "We have not been  able to make it this year, but the outcome is still infinitely better  than the Opposition promised - namely, a cut against Forward Estimates  of $100M which would have meant a ratio this year of just 0.30 per  cent",  Senator Evans said. .
