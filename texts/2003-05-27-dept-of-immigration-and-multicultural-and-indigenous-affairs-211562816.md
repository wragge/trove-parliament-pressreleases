  Review of Settlement Services far Migrants and  Humanitarian Entrants 

  Key findings & recommendations 

  Australia has one of the most comprehensive settlement programs in the world. However,  the extent of disadvantage in the current humanitarian intake and the increasing diversity of  the population (characterised by lower concentrations of migrants from a wider range of  source countries than in the past) pose challenges for service providers requiring on-going 

  examination and modification to programs. 

  The Department of Irnrnigr,ation and Mutticultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) settlement  services should focus on assisting individual migrants in the settlement services target  group, ie permanent residwnts who arrived in the previous five years as humanitarian  entrants or as family stream migrants with low English proficiency. 

  DlMlA settlement services should also focus on communities that are receiving significant  numbers of new arrivals in the settlement services target group and that require assistance  to develop their capacity to organise, plan and advocate for services to meet their needs. 

  Despite significant progresls in the implementation of access and equity principles, migrants  and humanitarian entrants continue to perceive difficulties in using mainstream services,  particularly in the areas of employment, skills recognition, housing, health, education, youth  services, family support ard aged care. An audit of the current state of play in relation to 

  access and equity would be beneficial. 

  DIMIAs settlement planning rolo should focus more strategicalty on services of particular  relevance to those in the settlement services target group and objectives should more  directly reflect directions under the Migration and Humanitarian Pragrams. A stronger  regional focus and a more proactive approach, supported by a stronger data analysis  capacity and improved carnmunieation and consuttation arrangements is also required. 

  Where appropriate, and where necessary services exist or can be developed, refugees  arriving in Australia should be directed to parts of regional Australia in order to address the  demand for less skilled labour in some regional economies and to assist humanitarian  entrants to achieve early employment. 

  Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Service  The recently introduced Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Service (IHSS) has resulted in  greater certainty and professionalism in the delivery of on-arrival services to refugees.  However, the review highlights the need for a range of improvements including measures  to;

  increase support for accessn to accommodation and for establishing a household; 

  facilitate early access tc medical services for those who need them; 

  strengthen case management and coordination across IHSS services; 

  improve links between IHSS and other settlement and mainstream services; 

  increase support for Special Humanitarian Program entrants whose proposers often have  difficulty providing adequate support to family members arriving from refugee-like situations;  and 

  reinvigorate the role of volunteers within IHSS, including through closer partnership with  other IHSS service providers. 

  Migrant Reaburce Centres 

  Recommendations relating to Migrant Resource Centres, Migrant Service Agencies and  organisations funded under the Community Settlement Services Scheme include that: 

  DlMlA advertise for funding proposals to address identified settlement needs in a specific  region, based on a stronger regional needs-based planning framework, supported by better  data and increased community consultation; 

  grant funding levels better reflect the cost of delivering work programs to meet identified  needs; 

  eligibility for CSSS grants be broadened, particularly in regional areas, to encourage more  flexible service delivery arrangements making better use of existing infrastructure; 

  within two or three years, the CSSS and MRC/MSA grant programs be combined, giving  MRCsMSAs acce68 to multiple year funding for outcomes-focused projects, instead of  receiving annual inputdriven core funding as at present 

  consideration be given to a separate grants program to assist longer-resident communities  to establish or maintain rel,ationships with mainstream service providers. 

  Other initiatives  Enhancements to the AMEP would extend the five year time frame for completion of tuition  and vary the targeting of the Special Preparatory Program to provide better learning  outcomes for those clients who do not have access to the range of further tuitian options  available to most clients exiting the AMEP. 

  There would be value in piloting a program of cultural orientation and information similar to  that operated by the International Organisation for Migration at Kakuma refugee camp in  Kenya to help humanitarian entrants to make the transition from rural Africa to life in  suburban Australia.  There should be further promotion of TIS telephone services, including the Doctor's Priority 

  Line, and additional suppcilrt to assist bilingual people in small and emerging communities  obtain accreditation for interpreting and translating work. 

  DlMlA should develop a more robust, integrated and efficient accountability and reporting  framework, incorporating a risk management strategy and client satisfaction evaluations.
