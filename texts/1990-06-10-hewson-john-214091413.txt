 THE PRIME MINISTER IS WAY "OFF BEAM" ON "SUSTAINABLE"  INFLATION

 One of the stories that was missed in the Prime  Minister's poor showing last week - most were correctly  distracted by his appalling handling of the refugee  question ~ was his floating of the concept of 

 "sustainable inflation" on ABC's Lateline Program.

 What on earth was he talking about?

 Is he really saying that he thinks the inflation rate  does not matter and that we should accept that we will  just see more of the same over the next three years.

 Does he really believe the employment gains he brags  about can be sustained if we do not tackle inflation?

 In the end surely it boils down to the international  viability and competitiveness of our industry.

 Aside from a brief period in 1984/85 our relative  inflation performance has been abysmal (see chart 1  attached) continuously running 3 to 4 % above the OECD  and at almost double our major OECD trading partners.

 Already most of the competitive gains of the 1985/86  devaluation have been lost (see chart 2).

 The Hawke/Keating monetary policies have given us the  worst of all worlds. Rising inflation and now rising  unemployment (see Chart 3).

 As unemployment rises over the next eighteen months,  inflation may fall a little but forcing up unemployment  is not a long-run solution to rising inflation.

 The Prime Minister is wrong to say that there is "general  acceptance" that inflation will fall to 6% in the  12 months to June 1991.

 Some major hurdles have to be crossed before anv  significant fall in inflation occurs

 -one is the risk of currency devaluation if the economy  slows further bringing domestic interest rates down or if

 commodity prices continue their recent downward momentum  (see chart 4 attached);

 - another is the impact on State charges which might flow  from Paul Keating's promised assault on State funding at  the forthcoming Premiers' Conference.

 But the more important point is that the Prime Minister  simply appears to be out of touch on with both domestic  and international thinking on inflation.

 As the following extract from the International Monetary  Fund's 'World Economic Outlook' show the world is looking  at the desirability of setting longer term policy to  achieving "zero" growth in inflation.

 "In recent years,the monetary authorities of several  industrial countries have indentified the achievement of  price stability as the key long-term objective of  monetary policy..... For example, the United Kingdom's 

 Financial Statement and Budget Report for 1989/90 states  that " Monetary policy is designed to reduce money GDP  growth and thus inflation over the medium-term, with the  ultimate objective of achieving stable prices", (Page 32)

 Alan Greenspan also raise the Zero inflation target issue  in his testimony to the US House of Representatives in  October 1989.

 Even our own Reserve Bank Governor Bernie Fraser has  talked about the need to halve Australia's inflation  rate.

 But the Government continues to rely on jawboning on this  matter. Paul Keating talks about "negotiating" inflation  down.

 What we need is a co-ordinated anti-inflationary policy  in Australia which will include a medium term monetary  strategy to wind back inflation together with a  complementary fiscal policy which cuts back the size of  the public sector so that taxes can be reduced to give 

 incentives to work, save and invest; a revamping of our  wage system which puts an end to Government/ACTU "deals"  that pay no regard to productivity and performance; and a  new Federal co-operative approach to micro-economic  reform.

 As the International Monetary Fund has said "elimination  of inflation would bring about a large and lasting  improvement in economic performance."

 That is the issue the Prime Minister should be addressing - not some half-baked notion of "sustainable inflation".
