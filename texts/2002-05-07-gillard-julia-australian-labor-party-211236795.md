 BRIDGING THE DIVIDE: A POPULATION POLICY TO BENEFIT ALL OF AUSTRALIA

 Introduction

 It’s a great pleasure to join you hear today and I thank the Minister for extending to me the opportunity to speak.

 To volunteer to be Labor’s spokesperson on Population and Immigration after the Tampa and the 2001 election, you have to be crazy brave, an eternal optimist, or a little of both.

 But volunteer I did, motivated by my belief that immigration has been unambiguously good for this nation.  For me that’s not an academic belief, it’s the foundation of the life I have lived.

 I migrated to this nation as a little girl with my Welsh parents, John and Moira and my sister Alison in 1966.  My earliest memories are of the Pennington migrant hostel in Adelaide.  We were part of the waves of migration into Adelaide at a time when South Australia was able to attract more than its share of overseas arrivals because it was a dynamic growing economy.

 Since arriving in Australia my parents have done exactly what millions of other migrants have done.  They have worked unbelievably hard, paid their fair share of taxes, abided by Australia’s laws to the letter, raised a family, paid for a home, provided for their retirement, cared for their grandchildren and contributed to their local community.  And in turn, Australia has been good to them, a land of opportunity where their dream of making a better life for their children has become a reality.  In microcosm they represent the reality of what immigration brings and has brought to this country.

 Obviously, their path was easier than those who came with different languages, different cultures and different religions.  But the essential message of optimism about immigration remains the same for all migrants no matter from where they have come. With Australia having recently celebrated the arrival of our six millionth migrant since World War II we know that Australia has been enriched and transformed by its immigrant population and that migrants have been enriched and transformed by coming to this country.

 Moving beyond the politics of race

 But in modern Australia we must be honest about the divisions as well as the achievements.  Since the 1996 election Australia has seen the ugly emergence of the politics of race.

 Of course Australia is not alone in that regard with western democracies like Norway, Denmark, Austria, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and most recently France infected with the politics of race.

 3

 The politics of race prospers in a climate of fear.  And many in our nation and in comparable democracies are understandably fearful.  After September 11th who amongst us hasn’t felt a shiver of fear?  In a world where change is the only constant, who amongst us hasn’t worried about what the future may hold?

 The 2001 election campaign was conducted on these themes and was built on exploiting the intersection between fear and race.  This is fertile ground politically but it inevitably leads to self-destruction, to the creation of a society paralysed by fear, collapsing inwards, yearning for the past and discriminating against difference.

 This is the exact reverse of where Australia should be as a nation: imbued with confidence, making its way in the world through global engagement, embracing innovation and characterised by inclusion.

 As a self-described optimist, I am hoping that today’s conference and the Prime Minister’s statements as recorded in The Australian newspaper on the weekend, mark an end to the political cycle of using fear and race.  I specifically welcome the Prime Minister’s retreat from the advocacy of discrimination in our immigration and his belated admission that his 1988 statements against Asian immigration were wrong.

 Now we have seen this small but significant step forward, it is time to ensure the forward momentum is maintained.

 Policies on refugees and asylum seekers

 The next step forward the Government must take is to move away from the vilification and dehumanising of asylum seekers and towards a national consensus on how asylum seekers are to be treated.

 Intolerance is not a measurable commodity that can be dished out in precise doses on specific targets.  There is a connection between the vilification directed at predominantly Muslim asylum seekers and the vilification of Muslims on our streets.

 It is time that the Government stopped the vilification, ended the children overboard affair by offering a real apology for grossly misusing false claims that asylum seekers threw children overboard and accepted Labor’s offer to work together to find a better way of dealing with asylum seekers who arrive on our shores.

 On Australia Day, Simon Crean made an offer on behalf of Labor to work with the Government to get the children out from behind the razor wire.  The Government should stop ignoring the plight of these children and accept Simon Crean’s offer today.

 A formal population policy

 The politics of race has damaged Australia’s earlier consensus about immigration. Immigration can only be addressed in the long term by the adoption of a formal population policy.

 4

 It is impossible to develop a vision for Australia’s future without seeking answers to the fundamental questions of how many Australians will there be and where will they live.

 The development of a formal population policy which is informed by sound research and adopted following community debate would enable immigration to be understood in context and seen as a vital part of nation building.

 The current Government’s denial of the need for a formal population policy is a dangerous form of myopia.  Australia cannot afford to allow itself to drift towards a destination defined by no more than current trends, ideologies and annual migration adjustments.

 Instead we should seize the opportunity to define our future by addressing in a co-operative way with state, local governments and business all of the issues which affect population.

 5

 Of course this is a much bigger agenda than just analysing immigration.  It requires us to look at the ways in which government can support families and the consequences of such policies on the fertility rate.  It raises issues of the environment, planning, infrastructure, industry, ageing and regional development.  There is no wishing away the complexity but surely the task of nation building, of defining a vision for the future, makes dealing with the complexity worthwhile.

 Labor has committed itself to the development of a formal population policy as part of developing its vision for Australia.  The policy will include numerical targets but importantly, will deal with the question of population distribution.

 Population distribution - the facts

 Australia is the fourth least densely settled country in the world and the most urbanised nation on the planet apart from city states such as Singapore and Monaco.

 While there have been some significant changes in the distribution of population between states, there has been no abatement of our urbanisation.

 Population growth outside metropolitan areas has been concentrated in the fringe areas of major cities from which it is possible to commute, attractive coastal areas, some major regional centres and some mining and tourist destinations.  What we can characterise as the great interior has experienced significant population losses.

 As the Australian population generally has clung to the major cities on the coast, the statistics tell us that the migrant population has clung even more tightly.  In our history of post-war immigration the continuing trend has been for migrants to settle in the nation’s largest cities.  1

 

 1  Over the period 1947-96 the number of Australia-born persons living in cities with 100 000 or more inhabitants more than doubled.  By 1996, 57.7% lived in such centres. On the other hand, the overseas-born population in the largest urban areas increased more than six times so that by 1996, 80% of Australia's overseas-born lived in those cities.

 6

 Analysing the growth in the percentage of the population born overseas shows the impact of immigration on these major cities. 2  Our migrant population has not only disproportionately settled in urban areas, it has concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne. 3  During the period 1947 to 1996, while their populations more than doubled, Sydney and Melbourne's share of the nation's foreign-born population has increased from 46.5% to 52.8%. On the other hand, their share of the Australian-born has fallen from 38.7 to 34.1%.

 While the statistics tell us that the greater amount of time a migrant is here the more likely he or she is to move away from a major city these dispersal patterns remain more constrained than for Australian born.

 It is clear also that newly arrived migrants are showing a particular preference for Sydney. 4

 The other side of the coin of the predisposition of migrants to settle in Melbourne or Sydney is the lack of migrants in rural Australia.  In 1947 a quarter of all overseas born persons lived in rural areas, but this shrank to just 7.4% in 1996.

 Population dispersal - the strategies

 The tendency for migrants to cluster in our major cities is completely understandable. In picking a destination from overseas they are more likely to know something about our largest cities and particularly Sydney.  Given the historic patterns of migrant settlement they are more likely to have family members or contacts in Melbourne or Sydney and the provision of settlement services has tended to focus on these centres.

 The tendency of the general population to be so urbanised is perhaps a little harder to explain.  In the Australian psyche the beach seems to loom increasingly large and while our national myth making centres on the bush, our real lifestyle does not.  In addition, economic activity and development has tended to be focussed on our major population centres.

 But to some extent both the tendency of the migrant population and the population generally to create sprawling coastal cities is the result of a lack of vision on the part of government and the lack of a national development agenda.

 There is no doubt that without real efforts to disperse population any population debate is likely to revolve around doing no more than maintaining or perhaps even reducing current population as our overstressed cities say no more.  For the nation, such an outcome would be full of negative implications for economic growth, dependency ratios, ageing and even defence.                                                           

 2  Over the 1947-96 period the percentage of the population in cities with more than 100,000 residents made up by the overseas-born increased from 11.6% to 29.1%. The true impact on the population of these cities would be under-estimated because these figures do not include children born to migrants after their arrival in Australia. 3

  It should be noted though that Perth has also had comparatively large migration numbers from predominantly English speaking countries.  In fact Western Australia now has the largest percentage of its population born overseas at 27.8%. 4

  Of those migrants who had been in Australia less than five years at the 1996 census some 37.5% lived in Sydney, almost twice Sydney's share of the total national population.

 7

 It is time to open up the debate about population dispersal, about nation building beyond our big coastal cities.  It is this debate that must lie at the centre of a formal population policy.

 The Government has introduced or maintained a number of schemes to encourage migrants to areas elsewhere than in the major cities.   There are a number of programs, including the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme and the State/Territory Nominated Independent Scheme.

 These policies have had a limited effect and accounted for less than 4,000 of the 85,000 migrants settling in Australia in 2000-01.  Labor believes we can aim higher.

 It is time to think more broadly about changes to our system and in a more precise way about the needs of individual regions and the needs of the people - immigrant and Australian-born - that we would wish to attract to these regions.

 Taken together the current schemes are a blunt instrument with the same policies applying effectively to migrants into metropolitan Melbourne as those into Derby. Clearly, the two share little in common and most certainly not the weather.

 To really address population dispersal questions, the Commonwealth needs to drive an agenda with the states and through them with local government.  Regions need to be targeted for growth and, as advocated by my colleague Craig Emerson, Labor’s shadow innovation and industry minister, a 20-year regional plan needs to be developed that draws together population, infrastructure, social and industry policies.

 The population incentives for a region could be a mix of policies to attract internal migration, policies to attract overseas migration and policies to encourage the retention of the current residents and most particularly the young.

 Looking solely at the question of overseas migration, the system I am envisaging would involve stronger incentives than the Government has in place.  Regional communities would be given a greater say in determining the size and nature of migrant intakes into their local areas.  Regions with labour or skill shortages might therefore be more active in utilising migration incentives for labour than those with high unemployment.  Regions with high unemployment may benefit, however, from higher levels of business migration or migration of wealthy retirees.

 Some regions might be happy to accept migrants with functional level English, instead of vocational level English as presently required under the various regional migration programs.  This could be done on the basis of commitments by sponsoring authorities and the migrants that upon arrival they undertake further English language training.

 One option for strengthening incentives might be to offer permanent residency to those migrants who stay in regional communities for a specified period of time - say more than two years.  By that time they will have had the opportunity to have experienced the local lifestyle, started or continued families locally and generally put down roots in the local community.

 8

 Another possibility is to offer temporary residency to overseas students who study and complete their courses at regional universities, with the prospect of conversion to permanent residency if they remain in regional locations for a specified period beyond course completion. Preferential treatment could be given to graduates who have undertaken their studies at rural or regional campuses and who are genuine about their desire to remain in Australia.

 By giving regions greater say in tailoring regional migration incentives to their own needs and community aspirations, and by providing for a strengthening of incentives for regions that are keen to attract more migrants, we can have the best of both worlds - more migrants moving directly from overseas to regional Australia and less pressure on the Sydney basin.

 Modern Australia could not have been built without the great post-war immigration program.  It’s time to look ahead to migrants playing an active part in rebuilding Australia by boosting our regions.  With a long-term vision and plan for rebuilding Australia, the Commonwealth can show the way, through a whole-of-governments approach, cooperating with state and local governments in harmonising infrastructure, population, environment and industry policies.

 And so I welcome the theme of this conference - migration benefiting Australia.  I hope it signals an end to the divisions of race politics and the beginning of bipartisanship in a bold endeavour to boost regional Australia, attracting new migrants to the regions and reaping the benefits of growth, prosperity, diversity and cultural enrichment that previous waves of immigration have provided to this great nation.
