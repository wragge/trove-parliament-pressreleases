 Helping communities celebrate diversity



 29 October 2015



 Joint Media Release with:



 The Hon Christian Porter MP



 The Minister for Social Services



 The Australian Government is investing $130,000 in 32 projects across Australia to help organisations host festivals



 and arts projects that celebrate diversity and unite communities.



 The successful recipients of the 2015-16 Multicultural Arts and Festivals Grants were announced today by Minister



 for Social Services, the Hon. Christian Porter MP and Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator the Hon.



 Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.



 “I am delighted Australian Government funding will help a range of not-for-profit organisations and local councils in



 respecting, supporting and growing social cohesion in Australia,” Mr Porter said.



 “Australia’s successful settlement of millions of migrants is a point of pride for our nation and the multicultural



 community organisations that help new arrivals play a huge role in making everyone feel welcome.”



 The festivals are spread across the country with eight in New South Wales, nine in Victoria, five in Queensland, four



 in South Australia, three in Western Australia, and one in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern



 Territory. A full list of funded events is available on the DSS website.



 Senator Fierravanti-Wells, said Australia’s multicultural diversity was reflected in the broad range of activities and



 organisations funded by the grants.



 “We live in one of the most culturally diverse nations on Earth and these projects illustrate the innovative approaches



 community groups bring to our society to help people share their culture,” Senator Fierravanti-Wells said.



 “Funded projects range from a Harmony Weekend residential camp programme in Adelaide to bring together families



 from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds to the Carnevale Community Celebration to celebrate



 multiculturalism through food, music and dance.



 “We should all get out there and celebrate what makes us Australian and celebrate our cultural diversity.”



 The Australian Government will continue to work with communities to capitalise on the social and economic benefits



 of diversity committing approximately $660 million in the 2015 Budget over the next four years.
