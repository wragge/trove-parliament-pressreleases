 Bob Brown 

 Australian Greens Leader 

 Greens offer stable leadership, climate change action 

 Media Release | Spokesperson Bob Brown  

 Saturday 17th July 2010, 2:17pm 

  “A strong safe crossbench in the Senate” - Brown 

 

 “I offer the electorate experienced and stable leadership, and the progressive policies and clear vision for 

 Australia’s future which the big parties are ignoring,” Australian Greens Leader Senator Brown said in 

 Canberra today.  

 

 “Moving forward will mean a carbon tax on polluters; bringing home safely Australia’s troops from 

 Afghanistan; a universal dental care scheme; humane treatment of asylum seekers in Australia; protecting 

 our forests and wildlife.”  

 

 “This election is also about the Senate and a strong crossbench delivering better outcomes for Australians. 

 The Greens are the responsible alternative to a deadlocked Abbott controlled Senate.” 

 

 “The Greens will campaign strongly on environmental issues including climate change action, the creation 

 of marine national parks, protecting native forests and wildlife and saving the Darling Downs farmlands 

 from 40,000 coal seam gas drill holes and open cut coalmines,” Senator Brown said. 

 

 Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown flew to Canberra from Sydney this morning to get the Greens’ 

 national campaign off to a flying start. 

 

 Senator Brown, who spoke last night to a packed campaign dinner in Sydney for Senate candidate Lee 

 Rhiannon MLC, will be in Canberra and Hobart on Sunday, and Adelaide on Tuesday morning.
