 Election commitments key to immigration success, says Minister

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today the Budget  delivers on the Government election commitments to multicultural Australia.

 "The Government is enhancing the integrity o f its non-discriminatory migration programmes and the  chances o f people settling successfully in Australia," M r Ruddock said.

 "This Budget shows the Government is committed to a multicultural Australia by maintaining a  balanced migration and humanitarian programme. We are also ensuring that people have access to and  knowledge o f a range o f settlement services, once they arrive in Australia. This includes English  language training for newly-arrived migrants.

 "The integrity o f the processing system will be strengthened through funding to speed up assessment  o f asylum claims and new measures to test the bona fides o f people seeking to enter Australia through  spouse/fiance migration."

 M r Ruddock reinforced the Government's commitment to meeting the needs o f people who came to  Australia under the Humanitarian Programme.

 "A full range o f services and access to benefits will continue for this group. However, in migration  categories where fees apply, the Government will move to fulfill its commitment o f user pays," Mr  Ruddock said.

 The measures announced by the Minister include:

 â¡ $5 million for an anti-racism education campaign in 1996-97 which will include  programmes covering schools, work places, sporting organisations and the community. After a  review, a further $5 million to complete programmes in 1997-98 is in prospect. â¡ an extra $17.6 million over four years for English language training through the Adult 

 Migrant English Program (AMEP). The Government is looking at competitive purchasing  and using public tendering to introduce greater flexibility in the delivery o f language services  and to ensure value for money. â¡ an additional $20.7 million over four years for enhanced settlement services. Migrants and 

 refugees will have enhanced settlement prospects through improved services from  community-based organisations. The Government is looking to increase community  participation in the delivery o f services to migrants and refugees.
