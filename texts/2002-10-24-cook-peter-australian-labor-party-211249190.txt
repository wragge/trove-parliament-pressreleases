 Press Release

 24 October 2002

 Children Overboard Inquiry

 “‘Intellectually deceitful’ … ‘disreputable’ and ‘sour grapes’: These are the terms that should be used to describe Senator Brandis’ minority report in the children overboard inquiry.

 The facts are

 â¢ Senator  Brandis  did  not  adhere  to  his  undertaking to  show  the  non-government  members  of the committee his report before it was printed as part of the tabling document.  This is despite the fact the committee agreed to put back the deadline for its report in order to accommodate Senator  Brandis’  inability  to  draft  his  remarks  in  time.   The  first  any  non-government committee member saw of his dissenting report was minutes before we were given a printed copy of the final report.

 â¢ This  was  a  properly  conducted  Senate  inquiry,  according  to  Senate  practice  and  within Standing Orders.  To describe it otherwise is disreputable.  Senator Brandis participated in all the  decisions  relating  to  the  conduct  of  the  inquiry.   He  never  raised  the  criticisms  he  now makes at any time during that period.  As for Peter Reith, he was invited to attend on at least three occasions and refused the invitation every time.

 â¢ On  several  occasions  Senator  Brandis  declared  to  the  committee  he  was  approaching  the hearings as if he were defence counsel for the government and Mr Reith.  His distorted view of  the  proceedings  should  be  understood  from  that  perspective.   The  role  of  senators,  he should be reminded, is to try to find out what happened.  It is not the role of senators to play defence  lawyer  to  particular  vested  interests  into  whom  they  supposed  to  be  conducting  an inquiry.

 â¢ The ‘pattern of conduct’ defence he has put up in his report is not credible.  The document he attaches to his report to verify the ‘pattern of conduct’ argument was ordered to be collected by  the  Navy  by  Senator  Hill  so  the  government  could  get  as  much  dirt  as  possible  on  the asylum-seekers.   This  is  another  abuse  of  the  defence  forces  for  political  purposes  by  the government.  But the remarkable thing about this document is how little and insignificant is the dirt it actually dredges up.  When tested it fell apart.  For example, the incident reported by HMAS Arunta that an asylum-seeker ‘attempted to strangle a child’, was later established to be that of a father holding a child back from joining a demonstration on another part of the boat.

 Perhaps  the  ultimate  comment  on  Senator  Brandis  is  that  after  sitting  through  fifteen  days  of hearings, sixty witnesses and 2,181 pages of transcript, he still maintains Peter Reith is innocent.
