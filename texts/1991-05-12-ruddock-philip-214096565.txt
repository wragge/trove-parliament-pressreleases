 BACKLOG IN IMMIGRATION a/h (02) 630 4575

 The Minister for Immigration in his statement claiming to address the permanent residence application  backlog raises more questions that it purports to answer.

 The statement fails to recognise the urgency of the problems created by illegal entry of up to 150,000  people. The backlog is a symptom of the Government's failure to seriously address questions of illegal  migration over time. For a number of reasons discussed below, it also threatens community support for  the immigration program.

 First, by granting large numbers of applications for permanent residence from within Australia,  expectations develop that illegal entry can be, and has been, rewarded.

 Second, processing the backlog and granting substantial numbers of applications which does seem to  have been the outcome, reduces the skill profile of the immigration program outcom e and maintains  in relative terms the planned outcome at a time when fewer applications for entry from overseas are  being presented.

 Third, while foreshadowed for some six months, it appears that additional resources for proper  administration are only now likely to be productively employed.

 Fourth, the Minister's statement fails to warn of the risk to proper selection procedures through efforts  to manipulate our collective compassion. Instead of 500 applications for refugee status per year,  Government policy, particularly in relation to PRC nationals have led to a backlog of 14,000 refugee  applications. This figure is growing at the rate of over 1000 per month.

 Existing arrangements for processing involve a mere 500 refugee applications. Now, as stated to Senate  Estimates Committee, refugee applications should exceed 20,000 by D ecem ber 1991. Departmental  officers expect an additional 13,500 cases a year for 2 years, as PRC nationals lodge applications.

 Of the 45,000 PRC students and- nationals believed to have entered Australia, officials have now  confirmed that only some 5,000 have left Australia.

 Fifth, the cost to Australian taxpayers of processing so many refugee applications is considerable in  itself. However, coupled with ongoing costs of maintaining possible refugee applicants who reach  Australia by sea, can add further to the cost to revenue. Additional estimates this year for housing,  guarding and servicing some 300 boat people amounts to $4 million.

 The greater the number of people applying for protection who have no bona fide reasons for doing so,  the more harm is done to the proper consideration of applications from those whose needs for  protection are real and sustainable.
