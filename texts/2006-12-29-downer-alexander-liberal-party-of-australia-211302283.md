 AMBASSADOR FOR PEOPLE SMUGGLING   

 I have today announced the appointment of Mr Michael Potts as Australia’s Ambassador for  People  Smuggling  Issues.   Mr  Potts  replaces  Ms  Lydia  Morton,  who  has  been  Ambassador   since December 2005.  The appointment, which will take effect in January 2007, underlines  the  Government’s  strong  ongoing  commitment  to  regional  cooperation  to  combat  people   smuggling, human trafficking and related transnational crime.   

 The  Ambassador  for  People  Smuggling  issues  is  responsible  for  high-level  advocacy  of   Australia’s interests in promoting effective and practical international cooperation to combat  these  crimes,  particularly  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  Mr  Potts  will  continue  to  promote  a   coordinated, whole-of-government approach to Australia’s engagement with the Bali Process  on  People  Smuggling,  Trafficking  in  Persons  and  Related  Transnational  Crime,  which   Australia co-chairs with Indonesia.   

 Mr Potts will work closely with other governments, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  and  the  International  Organization  for  Migration,  to  take  forward  the  practical  measures   adopted  under  the  Bali  Process,  including  the  promotion  of  regional  and  international   cooperation between key operational agencies. 

 

 Mr Potts was most recently High Commissioner in Port Moresby (2003-06).  Prior to this he  was First Assistant Secretary, International Division of the Department of the Prime Minister  and  Cabinet.   Other  positions  he  has  held  in  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade   include  First  Assistant  Secretary,  International  Organisations  and  Legal  Division;  Assistant   Secretary, Trade Policy Issues and Industrials Branch; Assistant Secretary, Mainland South-East Asia Branch and Assistant Secretary, ASEAN Bilateral Branch.   

 Mr  Potts  has  also  served  as  Ambassador  in  Hanoi;  Counsellor,  Australian  Mission  to  the   United Nations in New York and Acting High Commissioner in Lusaka, Zambia.   

 Mr  Potts  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Arts  degree  with  First  Class  Honours  in  History  from  the   University of Sydney. He is married.
