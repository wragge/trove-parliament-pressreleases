 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 MORE 2001 ELECTION CAMPAIGN LIES EXPOSED

 The Howard Government’s disgraceful attempt to link boat people to terrorists was today conclusively exposed as nothing more than an election smear campaign in evidence provided to the Human Rights Sub-committee of Parliament’s Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence & Trade Committee by the Director-General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson.

 Mr Richardson told the Committee that not one of the nearly 6000 asylum seekers coming by boat since 1 July 2000 had been rejected on security grounds.

 In the climate of fear the Government fanned over the Tampa last year and magnified by the horrific terrorist attacks in the USA, Peter Slipper, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration said:

 “There is an undeniable link between illegals and terrorists”.

 Having previously avoided personally making the explicit link between asylum seekers and terrorists for most of the campaign, the Prime Minister himself resorted to the big lie only three days out from the election:

 “I mean you have to be able to say that there is a possibility that some people having links with organisations that we don’t want in this country might use the path of an asylum seeker in order to get here.”   

 Even today in Question Time, in the face of Mr Richardson’s clear evidence, Minister Ruddock was still trying to fudge the truth.

 Labor maintains that you don’t have to lie to protect our borders.  The Government should apologise for these past lies and Minister Ruddock should make a clear statement to Parliament verifying that Mr Richardson’s evidence is the truth.
