 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services 

 Refugee Week in Sydney  25 June 2010 

 Thousands of people are taking part in Refugee Week events across Sydney, the  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie  Ferguson, said today.  

 ‘With Refugee Week 2010 in full swing, community organisations, schools and  councils are hosting events including festivals, sports competitions, markets,  lectures, award ceremonies and cultural displays,’ Mr Ferguson said.  

 ‘Refugee Week is an annual event to recognise the plight of refugees around the  world and to acknowledge our nation's long and proud tradition of resettling people  most in need. 

 ‘During 2010-11, the Australian Government will welcome 13 750 people through its  humanitarian program.’ 

 Mr Ferguson will celebrate Refugee Week in Sydney by attending a number of  special events. 

 On June 25, Liverpool City Council will stage a Refugee Week street festival. About  2500 people are expected to attend the information stalls, multicultural performances  and a refugee award ceremony. Mr Ferguson will launch the Refugee Migration  Stories project at the event, an initiative to identify the settlement needs of people  who settle in Sydney.  

 ‘The Liverpool community is very diverse, with 38 per cent of the community born  overseas,’ Mr Ferguson said.  

 ‘Some 75 000 people speak a language other than English at home, with Arabic,  Vietnamese, Hindi and Italian being the most common. Liverpool also has one of the  highest refugee intakes in Australia, with humanitarian entrants mostly from  Afghanistan, Iraq and the Sudan.’ 

 On June 26, Mr Ferguson will attend a Refugee Week event organised by the  Auburn City Council and local community organisations. This event will showcase  cultural performances, a drumming workshop and family activities, and will include  the Western Sydney Refugee Youth Awards, which recognise outstanding  achievement within the categories of art, music, sport, academics and leadership.  

 ‘Auburn is one of the most culturally diverse local government areas of Australia,  with more than half of Auburn residents born overseas,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 In the combined Liverpool and Auburn local government areas, more than 4000  humanitarian entrants have settled during the past five years. 

 ‘I would like to encourage all people in Liverpool, Auburn and across the entire  Sydney region to enjoy Refugee Week and celebrate at local events,’ Mr Ferguson  said.  

 Mr Ferguson will attend the Refugee Week street festival in Liverpool from  noon on June 25 and the Auburn Refugee Week community event from 3 pm  on June 26.
