 Crean Ducks Hard Decisions on Border Protection MPS 49/2002

 “The Opposition leader has once again displayed the ALP’s lack of commitment to a comprehensive border protection policy, and with his comments today has sent a signal to people smugglers that Australia is again open for business,” said the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today.

 “Mr Crean’s decision to oppose the Government’s well reasoned decision to extend the area of excised offshore places from the migration zone demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the comprehensive and successful strategies and policies this Government has applied to put an end to the people smuggling trade in this region.”

 Mr Ruddock said the Government has introduced measures that seek to detect, disrupt and deter potential unauthorised arrivals from travelling to and entering Australia.

 In doing so it has engaged source, transit and destination countries in a constructive and comprehensive manner resulting in the second longest period without boat arrivals in a decade.

 “This measure complements the Government’s broad strategy and was designed to ensure that the north of Australia is not open to the abusive practices of the people smugglers.

 "By doing so the Government is protecting Australia’s borders and those people who might fall victim to people smugglers who are able to avail themselves of safety and security in countries able to offer protection.”

 Mr Crean says that ‘nothing I’ve heard today convinces me that excision will deter people smugglers’.

 “I’m surprised that he is not able to recognise the comprehensive and successful nature of the government strategies. His support to this measure would have given a clear and unequivocal signal that Australia is united and determined to put an end to people smuggling,” said Mr Ruddock.

 “Mr Crean supported the excision of Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef but like his predecessor Kim Beazley has gone soft when it comes to supplementary measures.”

 Clearly the pressure from his party room is more significant than the national interest.

 It is ironic that Mr Crean should suggest the government strengthen ties with Indonesia at precisely the moment that Senator Ellison is signing an MOU on transnational crime demonstrating the Government’s continuing dialogue and understanding with Australia’s nearest neighbour.
