 Senate human rights committee slams refugee  bill   

 The Senate's human rights committee has highlighted a range of serious breaches of Australia's  human rights obligations that would result from the passage of the Abbott government's cruel TPV  and refugee assessment fast-tracking bill.   

 "This report is bad news for the Abbott government, who were trying to sneak these cruel measures  past the Senate cross-bench," the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “This bill is in clear contravention of Australia’s human rights responsibilities.   

 “The Parliament can stop this bill in its tracks and I believe this report will give my Senate colleagues  pause for thought.   

 “This bill will see refugees returned to danger, the breaking of international law and people being  subjected to extended and damaging arbitrary detention. That can’t be allowed to happen.   

 “Temporary Protection Visas leave refugees living in a permanent and cruel limbo. By blocking this  bill, the Parliament can stand up to the Abbott government’s obsession with cruelty.”
