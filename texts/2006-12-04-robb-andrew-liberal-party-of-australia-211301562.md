 Media Centre  $1.5 million announced for grants to support  Australian values 

 4 December 2006 

 An initiative to help Zimbabwean immigrants settle in regional  Queensland and a scheme to introduce Iraqi refugees in Melbourne  to Australian values are among the recipients of $1.5 million in  funding announced today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Robb.  

 ‘The funding is provided under the Australian Government’s Living in  Harmony programme which helps local organisations to develop  grassroots programmes to promote Australian values and help people  realise the opportunities offered by living in Australia,’ Mr Robb said.  

 ‘Forty-three community groups, schools and local governments  across Australia are to receive Living in Harmony funding - local  groups are the best placed to bring people from different backgrounds  together and encourage them to fully participate in the Australian  community.  

 ‘Projects also include a programme of workshops to engage the  Muslim, Sikh and Afghan communities in Western Australia and in  Victoria, the State Emergency Service’s plan to involve people from  different backgrounds in rescue activities.  

 This year 561 applications were received for the Living in Harmony  funded community projects. Priority went to projects promoting inter-faith initiatives, new and emerging communities, schools and those  involving Indigenous Australians.  

 Successful applicants were drawn from all states and territories with  each organisation to receive funding from $5 000 to $50 000 for each  project.  

 Visit the Living in Harmony website for the state and territory listing of  the 2007 community funded projects.   See: www.harmony.gov.au
