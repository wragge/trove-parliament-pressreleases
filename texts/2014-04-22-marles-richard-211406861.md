 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 MANUS ISLAND REPORT MUST BE RELEASED WITHOUT DELAY    

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has said  footage reported today by Fairfax Media of violence at the Manus Island Regional  Processing Centre is deeply concerning.    

 The footage was taken during the events of 16-18 February, which are the subject  of a Government inquiry due to report this month.    

 This final report must be made public as soon as the Government receives it, unlike  the interim report into incident - which has been sitting on Minister Morrisonâ€™s desk  for three weeks.    

 We need to get to the bottom of what happened at the Manus Island facility to make  sure we do not see this kind of event occur again.     

 The Abbott Government must commit to making the full report public and without  delay.    

 The Australian public have a right to know what exactly took place at the Manus  Island Regional Processing Centre in February.  We need to be assured the proper  safeguards will be put in place to ensure the facility is run in a safe manner.    

 Asylum seekers must be treated in a dignified, humane manner and we must ensure  they are housed in a safe environment.
