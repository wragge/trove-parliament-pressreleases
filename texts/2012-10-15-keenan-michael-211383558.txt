 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling TWO MORE BOATS ARRIVE AS BORDER  CHAOS GROWS UNDER LABOR’S FAILURE October 14, 2012

 The arrival of two more illegal boats, with a total of over 150 people on board, means almost 350 people have arrived in  two days, over half the capacity of Manus Island, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 "The chaos on our borders is growing by the day as arrivals under Labor's half-hearted policies continue at record levels,"  Mr Morrison said

 "Labor's half-hearted policies have created a chaotic situation on our borders that people smugglers continue to exploit,"  he said.

 "While Labor remains in denial about reinstating the full suite of Coalition measures to stop the boats, record boat arrivals  continue.

 "Sri Lankan arrivals also keep coming with Labor refusing to enter talks with the Sri Lankan Government to send back  their nationals before they enter our waters.

 "More arrivals mean more budget blow outs and more taxpayer funds spent on Labor's failure, with a record $1.4 billion  spent on illegal boats last financial year," Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “These two latest boat arrivals carrying a total of 153 people have pushed the number of  boat arrivals  under Labor to 27,008 people on 456 boats, approaching nearly twice the number of boat arrivals under the Howard  government.”

 “For the whole duration of the former Coalition government, from March 1996 to November 2007 there was a total of 239  boats carrying 13,584 people, the bulk of which arrived prior to the implementation of the Coalition’s tough border  protection measures which stopped the boats to a mere trickle.

 “In 2012 so far we have seen 12,354 people seek to take advantage of the porous state of our borders - it is simply  unacceptable that this year has seen on average 1,300 people arriving on boats per month.

 “The Gillard Labor Government are a weak government paralysed by indecision and incompetent management of our  borders - the Australian people deserve better and have a right to expect at the very least a government that has some  semblance of control over Australia’s borders,” Mr Keenan said
