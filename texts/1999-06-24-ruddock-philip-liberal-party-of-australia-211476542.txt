  Preliminary Report

  

 On 27 May   1999 you appointed me to conduct an independent Inquiry into 
matters relating to a pregnant national of the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) who was removed by Australia   to the PRC and is alleged to have been subject to a forced 
abortion thereafter.

  

 2. Subsequently in a Senate Legislation Committee hearing 
on 2 June

 1999 Senator John Quirke raised a further allegation 
as follows:

  

 In the case that Senator Harradine   raised three or four weeks ago, an allegation has been made 
to me that, that woman had to be heavily sedated to go back to China. 
And that in fact that sedation was administered not by a doctor but 
by a nurse and in fact a doctor was not called and was not in attendance".

  

 3. After some questioning Senator Quirke continued.

  

  "As I understand it,  as it has been reported to me, that 
in fact officers present there - not from the Department of Immigration 
who are handling this case -requested that a doctor be present because 
of the extreme, or the late stage of this pregnancy and that, by your 
Department, was refused and that on directions from your Department, 
a considerable amount of sedation was administered to this woman. Now, 
if you would pass that on to the inquiry as well please."

  

  4. The Inquiry into the circumstances of the woman's return and

 subsequent events is proceeding but it will be some 
time before it is

 completed. With the co-operation of officials from 
your Department and

 Australian Protective Service and Ms Marion Le, President 
of the

 Independent Council for Refugee Advocacy I have located 
the main people

 involved in the removal process in 1997. I have interviewed 
several and will

 visit Melbourne, Perth and Port Hedland for further 
interviews over the next

  few weeks. Others are returning from overseas and interstate to be

  interviewed i n Canberra. Information has been received from 
the Australian

 Embassy in Beijing and the Consulate General in Guangzhou 
and further

 material from China relevant to the Inquiry is expected. 
I know of no further

 material which is relevant to this particular aspect 
of the Inquiry.

  

 5. The one aspect of the Inquiry which has been completed 
relates to the

 sedation allegation.

  

 6. I contacted Senator Quirke to seek his co-operation 
in interviewing his

 informant, the source of the allegation. Subsequently, 
his informant spoke

 to me on the telephone from Senator Quirke's office 
but was not willing to

 disclose his identity nor to see me in person. When 
the person could not

 provide details of the dates and persons involved, 
he agreed to check on the

 dates when he was at Port Hedland. Later that night 
he telephoned me to

 say that he had left Port Hedland some months before 
14 July 1997, the

 date of the woman's return to China and had not been 
involved in the

 operation to return her group (Operation Ox). He said 
that he must have

 heard of the incident from someone else or had confused 
it with another

 case.

  

 7. I have interviewed the senior Immigration official 
on Operation..Ox,

 Mr Peter Vardos, Assistant Secretary. He has been 
in charge of at least

 twelve similar operations. Mr Vardos remembers her 
departure from Port

 Hedland and the return journey well because of a) 
the advanced stage of her

 pregnancy and b) her distress. He recalls that she 
was comforted at the Port

 Hedland Detention Centre by the Senior Immigration 
official and APS

  officers. He had no knowledge of any sedation and would have expected 
to

  have been informed if any sedation had been administered.

  

  8. Mr Vardos recalls arranging for the woman and her APS escort to

 leave the aircraft during refuelling at Brunei as 
she was uncomfortable and

 her ankles had swollen considerably. (All other passengers 
were kept aboard

 the aircraft). He recalled that the woman had re-boarded 
the aircraft and

 was seated with an APS escort at the front of the 
aircraft to give her more

 leg room to help her sleep. Mr Vardos described the 
flight and the arrival at

 Nanning as uneventfu!.

  

 9. The former officer-in-charge of the Australian Protective 
Service at

 Port Hedland Detention Centre, Mr Duscher, was 21C 
of the APS team

 allocated to Operation Ox. Mr Duscher is now Airport 
Manager at Port

 Hedland. As you know, the APS is no longer responsible 
for security at Port

 Hedland Detention Centre with a private company Australasian 
Correctional

 Management (ACM), now being responsible. He is emphatic 
that no

 sedation was given. Mr Duscher said that he knew the 
woman well as she

  had been at the Centre for three years. In addition, she was frequently 
in

  tears and seeking attention from the mental health nurse and other 
nursing

  staff. She was distressed at the D etention Centre prior to 
departure and was

 comforted by the Immigration officer-in-charge, Mr 
Robert Haynes, and APS

 personnel. He recalls that she was sitting apart from 
the other people being

 returned. He did not regard this as unusual as her 
relations with the other

 residents were not close.

  

 10. The then senior Immigration officer at Port Hedland 
Detention Centre,

 Mr Robert Haynes, has left the Australian Public Service. 
He was located

 and cooperated fully with the Inquiry. Mr Haynes said 
that he saw no

 sedation administered to any returnee. He said that 
any decision on sedation

 was purely a medical one authorised in person or in 
an emergency by

 telephone by a medical officer and neither Immigration 
nor APS officers had

 any role to play in such decision. Mr Haynes said 
that he knew the woman

 very well as she was often emotional and demanding.

  

 11. Mr Peter Holthouse who replaced Mr Haynes as senior 
Immigration

 officer at the Centre was present at the removal as 
an observer. He recalls

 standing at the top of the aircraft steps as passengers 
embarked. He said

 that all entered the aircraft without assistance or 
incident. The womans

 medical records from Port Hedland are extensive. The 
last entry records the

 prescription on 14 July 1997 of Quells (sic) to combat 
travel sickness.

 There is no record of any sedation being administered 
on that day or any

 other time.

  

 12. Both Mr Haynes and Mr Holthouse said that there 
was a strict

 protocol on administering sedatives. Sedation was 
to be administered only

 when there was a serious risk of self-harm or violence 
to others. Counselling

 was the first option, then with the consent of the 
patient tablets (believed to

 be a muscle relaxant, such as Valium) and finally 
sedation by injection,

 recorded in both the drug register and in personal 
medical records.

  

  Conclusion

  

 13. I am grateful to Senator Quirke for his cooperation 
with my Inquiry. I

 have come to the conclusion that there is no substance 
in the allegation that

 a woman in advanced stage of pregnancy was sedated 
before she embarked

 on the aircraft at Port Hedland to return to China. 
If any further information

 should come to light on this aspect of my Inquiry, 
I will include it in my final

 report.

  

 14. To protect the privacy of the individual I have 
not revealed the name

 of the Chinese woman in the report. Whilst the media 
have published her

 name, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs, Senator

  Harradine and Senator Quirke have not revealed her name.
