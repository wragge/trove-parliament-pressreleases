 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling LABOR’S $1.1 BILLION 2012/13 ASYLUM  BUDGET BLOWN IN FIRST MONTH July 23, 2012

 Labor’s $1.1 billion asylum budget for this year is already falling apart with more than 1,240 people turning up on illegal boats  so  far  this  month,  compared  to  their  budget  estimate  of  just  450  arrivals,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "The latest illegal boat to arrive, carrying 123 passengers, means we have had more than 450 people turn up in the past seven days and 1,242 since the beginning of July," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Under Labor’s weak and failed border policies, more people are arriving in a week than they have budgeted to arrive in a month.  This  will  have  an  inevitable  impact  on  blowing  out  Labor’s  asylum  budget,  as  has  occurred  with  every  budget   revision during the past three years. The total cost of these blowouts so far is $4.7 billion. 

 "This year’s budget was already increased by more than one million dollars a day when announced back in May, based on assumptions that included just 450 arrivals per month. 

 "The  bill  for  taxpayers  is  clearly  going  to  keep  rising  as  long  as  the  boats  keep  on  coming  under  Labor.  While  there  is speculation  about  the  mining  boom,  it’s  clear  the  people  smuggling  boom  will  continue  as  long  as  Labor  remains  in government," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "The latest boat arrival, carrying 123 people, is the 90th illegal vessel to be intercepted this year. 

 "Twenty illegal boats carrying well over 1,000 people have been intercepted this month alone - Border Protection  Command cannot continue to cope with this relentless influx of arrivals. 

 "If the Government doesn’t act to fix this crisis at our borders then they will not only be risking the lives of those making  this dangerous journey but also the health and safety of our border protection personnel. 

 "Labor must swallow their pride and reinstate the Coalition’s proven policies and put an end to this evil people smuggling  trade," Mr Keenan said.
