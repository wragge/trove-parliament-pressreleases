 PRIME MINISTER

 FOR MEDIA MONDAY AUGUST 2 1982

 ADDRESS AT DINNER GIVEN BY THE  PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYSIA

 I have looked forward very much to this visit and the . '  opportunity it provides to have discussions with you  and your government on international and regional  developments which affect our countries’  interests.

 This is the first time I have visited Malaysia since  you became Prime Minister, and looking from Australia, I have been impressed by the determination of your  government to generate national co-operation and dynamism 

 in order to achieve economic growth and continue to build  a modern progressive society.

 I hope that this meeting will help to strengthen the close  understanding and forward looking approach which has been  established between our two governments.  It is clear  from our talks that we have a large number of shared 

 and complementary interests, which will ensure that we  maintain the vitality of our bilateral relationship.

 Relations between countries are, however, founded on more  than relations between governments. They are built on a  mutual knowledge and understanding between peoples. The foundations were laid long ago for an enduring and 

 warm relationship between Australians and Malaysians. We have shared adversity and we have shared peace and  growing prosperity, and our people have numerous contacts.

 Thousands of young Malaysians come to Australia and we like  to feel that through these contacts, Australia and Malaysia  are working together to.develop skills which are needed  to sustain long term economic growth and cope with a 

 continuously changing world. We place particular value  on this aspect of our relationship, and look forward to  maintaining it. .

 Our defence co-operation arrangements represent a common  commitment to the security of our region, and have  contributed to its stability. These varied ties have been  strengthened by economic links which have grown as 'our  two economies have prospered. Our bilateral trade grew  by an average of 20% per annum between 1975/76 and 1980 / 81,  and there is now considerable Australian investment in  Malaysia,  and Malaysian investment in Australia. .

 Politically, Malaysia's role as our ASEAN contact partner  has been especially important in our evolving and healthy  relationships with ASEAN. Of course our political, defence  and trade relationships are very important for a number of "

 strategic and economic reasons, but the greatest value of ' all these contacts is their role in creating mutual  knowledge and understanding, which guarantees our close  relationship in the future. .

 The world has experienced great strains both politically  and economically over the last few years. The world economy  is now going through a prolonged recession, a recession  which is having a detrimental impact on both our economies.

 I understand that despite the impressive economic growth  which Malaysia has achieved, the world recession is posing  difficulties for your economy. Falling export markets and  commodity prices in particular will no doubt prove a hindrance 

 to your expanding economy and your successful plans for economic  diversification.

 Australia has also had comparatively high economic growth in  recent years, but as a major trading nation we are heavily  dependent on exports for our economic growth, and we are  now seriously affected by world recession. This world 

 situation has been compounded as countries have tried  to protect themselves by increasing protectionist devices  and export subsidies. These measures are depressing world  trade, and together with falling commodity prices, contributed  to a contraction in world trade in value terms last year 

 for the first time in over 20 years. ... .

 .. . <  · ;  · ' ; ;  . .. . (

 Some economists have been predicting that the world economy .   will recover in six months time. They have been saying this  for years, and each six months has seen the situation become  more serious. I believe that the world cannot afford to just 

 sit back and do nothing, and I also believe that moves to take  effective action need not just be the prerogative of the big  powers. Many of us were disappointed that the recent Versailles  Summit failed to act with the vigor or vision which could 

 achieve the kind of economic breakthrough which we all want  so much.

 For our part, Australia has advanced a concrete multilateral  proposal which, if implemented,  would assist in restoring  stability and confidence to the world economy. We have called  for a freeze on increases in levels of protection, followed  by negotiations designed t o .  lower protection, and a phasing 

 out over five years of export subsidies. These proposals have  been well received by the international community. No country  could adopt them unilaterally, no country would find it easy  to adopt every part of them, but if countries would act in  concert to implement these proposals or something like them,  we would all benefit enormously.

 The rising tide of world protectionism is making it very  hard to make progress on North-South issues and to provide  greater economic opportunities to countries in the developing  world, many of which, like Malaysia and Australia, are raw  material suppliers.

 Australia has given a very high priority to the North-South  dialogue. Like Malaysia, we endorse the need for global,  negotiations on international economic development issues,  and are disappointed that there has as yet been no agreement 

 on launching the negotiations.. But even this failure should  not prevent progress in specific negotiations on North-South  issues at the GATT Ministerial Meeting in November, UNCTAD  VI next year and the forthcoming meetings of the major 

 international financial institutions.

 I have been disappointed that not all countries have been  prepared to support the draft Law of the Sea Convention. If implemented it would be beneficial not only to developing  countries but to the whole international community. I. hope 

 those who are not so far committed to the convention will  modify their views in the interests of all of us. But instability  and uncertainty are not just confined to the economic sphere.  Armed conflict has become so widespread that practically no 

 region of the world is free from war, repression, armed  insurgency or terrorism, and we have recently been reminded  by the wars between Iran and Iraq and in the South Atlantic  of how armed conflicts can erupt quite unpredictably.

 International tension has been exacerbated by the expansionist  objectives and destabilising influence of the Soviet Union. The Australian Government supports strongly President Reagan's 

 determination to deal with the Soviet Union from a position  of strength, for the Soviet Union in its international dealings  has no respect for weakness. John F. Kennedy put the argument  aptly when he said "let us never negotiate out of fear".  

 Importantly, Kennedy added to this statement the words: "But never let us fear to negotiate".  We welcome the decision  of the Soviet Union and the United States to begin arms  reduction talks, but these talks will achieve nothing unless 

 the Soviet Union is convinced of American and Western  determination to counter Soviet aggression and rearmament  in every instance. '

 Mr Prime Minister, the Australian people have been very  conscious of the challenge posed by the continued Vietnamese .   occupation of Cambodia.  The' crisis in Cambodia is a human .   tragedy of appalling proportions. The Khmer people have 

 distinctive culture and nationalism, and the current state  of affairs in Cambodia should not continue.

 The role the ASEAN partners have played to put pressure on  Vietnam to restore Cambodia as an independent and non-aligned  state has won widespread international support. Australia .   has supported ASEAN resolutions on Cambodia put forward at 

 United Nations general assemblies, and the work of the  international conference on Cambodia/, and we share your  hope that the recent formation of a tripartite coalition ,   of anti-Vietnamese Khmer groups will contribute positively 

 to a settlement of this issue. .

 The Australian Government will continue to give active  support to humanitarian relief measures and to play a full  part in developing solutions to the refugee problem.

 Mr Prime Minister, the attention of the whole world has  been caught by the constructive role that ASEAN is playing  in the region, its considerable economic achievements, and  its enormous contribution to regional stability.

 It is thanks partly to ASEAN that our region has become one  of the most stable and prosperous in the world.ASEAN is also  setting an important example to the wider Pacific region. Many new countries have emerged in the Pacific and they face  daunting challenges of limited resources and vast distances.

 The Pacific governments are now playing an active part in  broadening their international relationships and working  more closely together with the region as a whole. I

 I know your visit to Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa recently  was greatly valued, as were the offers of technical co-operation  which you conveyed to the South Pacific countries. In a few  days I will be attending the meeting of the Heads of Government 

 of the South Pacific Forum in Rotorua where matters of direct  and practical interest to the Pacific governments will be  discussed. '  .  â 

 A South Pacific country, Fiji, will be host in October to  the meeting of Commonwealth Regional Heads of Government  which will discuss a number of major economic and political  issues of concern to our region. We see these regional  meetings as an example of how the Commonwealth has modernised 

 and kept pace with the needs of the international community. -The Commonwealth as a whole still represents a unique  forum for bringing.together for the common good countries  from all over the world and from a number of different 

 cultures and political systems. Its success as the instrument  which brought a settlement in Zimbabwe, and its work on a range  of North-South issues, are examples of how the Commonwealth  can have real, practical significance. .

 Mr Prime Minister,  I have mentioned just some of the wide  range of common interests,  political economical and strategic  which our two countries have. Our close relationship is  going to help us contend with the difficulties and challenges  before our region and before the world.

 If, Mr Prime Minister, my own visit and our discussions  have added further to our ties which are a part of history, I shall be very pleased. '  -

 May I thank you and your Ministers for the hospitality  and generous courtesy which you have given me and my party in  this visit. The mutual and co-operative spirit which  manifests here in abundance will be for me an enduring  memory.  In recognition of this spirit of mutual co-operation,

 I now have the honour to propose a toast to the Right Honourable  the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato1  Seri Dr. Mahathir and  Datin Seri Dr.. Siti Hasmah.
