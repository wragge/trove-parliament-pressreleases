 Julia Gillard Talking Tough - An Election Must be Imminent     

 8 July 2010 

 For Immediate Release    

 “Prime  Minister  Gillard’s  claims  of  a  midnight  conversion  to  offshore  processing  are  an   unconvincing and cynical attempt to con Australian voters,” Liberal Senator Michaelia Cash said  today.   

 “Like  former  Prime  Minister  Rudd,  Prime  Minister  Gillard  is  talking  tough  because  a  federal   election is imminent.”     

 “Prior to the 2007 Federal election Mr Rudd and Labor talked tough, promising to turn back the  boats. As soon as Labor was elected; however, it back flipped and commenced rolling back the  effective border protection policies put in place by the Howard Government.”    

 “Under Labor, approximately three illegal arrivals enter our country per week. Under the former   Howard Government, approximately three illegal arrivals entered our country per year.”   

 “The  Rudd/Gillard  Labor  Government  has  failed  Australians  when  it  comes  to  protecting  our   borders.  Labor  is  as  likely  to  implement  offshore  processing  as  it  is  to  return  Australia  to  a   surplus,” Senator Cash said. “We need a Government that unambiguously tells people smugglers  that Australia is no longer open for business.”   

 “The  Coalition  found  a  problem  with  asylum  seekers  in  the  early  2000s  and  fixed  it.  The   Rudd/Gillard Labor Government had a solution and in typical Labor style it created a problem.”    

 “Ms Gillard’s recent announcement on border protection policy is just more Labor rhetoric. Instead  of looking for a solution that will actually address the unprecedented arrival of illegal boats under  their failed policies, Labor is looking for the quick political fix.”    

 “Ms Gillard is desperate to win an election and her latest announcement is just more Labor spin  with little substance. She has not even had an in depth conversation yet with the Prime Minister of  East Timor.”   

 The Coalition has set out its strong border protection policy. It will:    

 â¢ restore temporary protection visas; 

 â¢  send  boats  back  to their  original  location  when circumstances  permit,  such  as  when  the   relevant boat is seaworthy and the sea conditions are right;

 â¢ have a presumption against granting refugee status for asylum seekers who destroy their  documents before entering Australia; 

 â¢  expand  the  Immigration  Minister’s  powers  to  give  him  or  her  greater  oversight  over   decisions about protection claims. It is appropriate to give the Minister this power because  he  or  she  is  ultimately  the  person  who  will  have  to  explain  these  decisions  to  the   Australian people; 

 â¢ give priority to asylum seeker applications that come from seekers who are offshore; and 

 â¢  the  Coalition  will  trial  a  refugee  sponsorship  program  whereby  community  groups  can   sponsor refugees to come into Australia as long as the community groups can pay for the  refugees. This program is based on a similar successful project in Canada.
