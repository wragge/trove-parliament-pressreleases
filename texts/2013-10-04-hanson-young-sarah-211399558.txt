 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 4 October 2013   

 500 Syrian refugees should come in  addition to reduced intake   

 The Coalition’s decision to provide 500 Syrian refugees with safety in Australia should  come in addition to the annual humanitarian intake which Tony Abbott has cut by more  than 6,000 places, from 20,000 to 13,750, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Giving with one hand while taking away with the other isn’t the Australian way of doing  things,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Offering safety to Syrian refugees is essential but as a wealthy, generous nation  Australia can and should be doing more to help those in our region.   

 “Slashing Australia’s humanitarian intake by more than 6,000 places has sent the wrong  message to refugees who are languishing in Indonesia and Malaysia.   

 “Cutting our humanitarian intake means that more refugees, including families and  children, will see a dangerous boat journey as the only way to reach safety.   

 “Australia needs to stand up and lead a genuine regional approach that cares for  refugees while saving lives at sea.   

 “The Greens’ policy to create safer pathways by increasing the intake and funding the  assessment of refugees in Indonesia is a far better and more humane way to stop people coming  by boat.”
