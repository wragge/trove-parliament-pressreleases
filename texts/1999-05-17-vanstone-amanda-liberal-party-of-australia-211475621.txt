  SUSPECTED BOAT PEOPLE FOUND ON VESSEL DETAINED 
AT SEA

  

  The Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, tonight 
c onfirmed that a vessel detained earlier today off the south 
coast of NSW was carrying suspected illegal entrants.

  

 A preliminary search of the 45-metre vessel, which 
is currently under escort to Sydney, had so far found more than 80 people 
most of them hidden in secret compartments below decks.

  

 Senator Vanstone said the total number of people on 
board would probably not be known until the vessel docked, and after 
a comprehensive search was conducted by Customs officers. Customs would 
also closely examine the vessel for anything else of interest to law 
enforcement authorities.

  

 “I can now reveal that the successful interception 
of this vessel is the result of a difficult and long-running joint operation 
of Customs and the AFP which also involved strong support from the Defence 
Forces and the NSW Police,” Senator Vanstone said.

  

 She said the operation which led to the interception 
of the vessel had begun last month after a Customs search of a passenger 
at Sydney International Airport.

  

 “As a result of this and other inquiries Customs 
and the Federal Police set up a joint operation,” Senator Vanstone 
said.

  

 “Coastwatch aircraft and the Australian Customs 
Vessel   Delphinus  
were then deployed to monitor vessel movements in the coastal region 
south of Sydney.”

  

 Continuing investigations had led to the operation 
being scaled up over the past weekend with additional assistance being 
provided by the Air Force, the Navy and the NSW Police.

  

 “Late yesterday a Coastwatch Dash 8 aircraft located 
a suspect vessel some 15 nautical miles off the coast south of Sydney. 
The vessel was then kept under covert surveillance by an Air Force P3 
Orion until it was stopped by the HMAS   Fremantle  and then boarded earlier today.

  

 Immigration officials will interview the people on 
board to determine their immigration status once the vessel has reached 
Sydney.
