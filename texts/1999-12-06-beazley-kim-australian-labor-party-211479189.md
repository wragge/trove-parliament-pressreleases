 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 
6 DECEMBER 1999

  E&OE - PROOF ONLY

  

  Subjects:  Davis Cup, declining of invitation to London, appointment 
of Ambassador to Washington, status of our relationship with Indonesia,  
illegal immigrants, change of date for Australia’s national day, GST 
on charities, trade, Gough Whitlam at the Timor inquiry

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, firstly, congratulations to our Davis Cup squad. 
What a fantastic job, particularly, of course, to Scud Philippoussis, 
who blitzed his opposition, and to the Woodies, who did one of those 
awe-inspiring character-building fightbacks. It seems as though, in 
international competition these days, Australia can’t miss. And it 
gives our people such joy when we see these events. I’m very proud 
of them.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, will you be travelling to London to take 
up Mr Howard’s invitation next year?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, this started off as a good idea by well-motivated 
people to find an appropriate point of contact with our Constitution’s 
origin, if you like. That’s where it started. It’s now really gone 
over the top. It’s too much impinging on the taxpayers’ good intentions, 
good faith, or whatever, and it’s got too big. It needs to be pared 
back. And the circumstances in which we sit and look at this now, I 
don’t think I’d add anything to it by going. So, I won’t be.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What’s the Opposition’s calculation of how much 
the pilgrimage will cost taxpayers?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, there are many, many people going. We don’t 
really have a number on it but we do know that whenever we look around 
a corner somebody else is going. And, look, I think it’s a very appropriate 
thing to celebrate the origins of our Constitution, don’t get me wrong, 
but if we’re spending large dollars on it, the right place to celebrate 
it is here in Australia. That’s the right thing to do. And there are 
some good things on offer in terms of celebrating the federation here 
in Australia, and I’ll be a joyful participant in as many of them 
as I can be.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, is this not perhaps a bit of, I suppose, 
republican churlishness, is it, to say, you know, ‘why go to London, 
we should be doing it all here’?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I think it’s more a concern for the cost of the 
thing. I don’t think it’s inappropriate for there to be some sort 
of commemoration in the UK. But there does seem to be hundreds going, 
or maybe not hundreds, but very large numbers going. This is a period 
of time when those of us in public office need both the reality and 
appearance of some restraint. We’ve operated with governments now 
for some considerable period of time which have pared back public outlays 
in areas which are really essential for the nation - like education, 
like health. And it’s necessary when these things occur that we show 
the same level of austerity in the way in which we behave ourselves. 
Frankly, we’ve pared back too far in education and health and we need 
to build back public investment. But that’s a point at which we start, 
not in the celebration of a federation.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What about your Labor State colleagues? Do you know 
whether any of those, all of those, will go or not?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I think it’s entirely up to them and I wouldn’t 
be critical of them if they did. As I said, this started out as quite 
a good idea and then it’s an idea that people began to get a bit carried 
away with, in terms of the numbers who felt that they ought to be involved 
in it. So, many of them will feel that it’s a good thing to respond 
to. But whilst it’s the size it is now, I don’t think I’d add 
anything to it by impinging on the taxpayers myself and going. It’s 
a ...

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Who should be the first people pared off, in the paring 
back process?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, not the Prime Minister, obviously. If the Prime 
Minister wants to dovetail it with a visit to the UK and take his Trade 
Minister with him, entirely appropriate. There are plenty of Australians 
over there who can be found to participate in whatever the celebrations 
are that do take place over the issuing of the Constitution. But it 
does seem there’s a heck of a lot more than just them turning up.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 If it was trimmed back significantly, would you reconsider 
going?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I find it very difficult to see that they will trim 
it back that far. So, rather than foreshadow that, let’s just wait 
and see what they do.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 On another foreign front. Does the appointment of 
our new Ambassador to Washington enjoy bipartisan support?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Yes, it does. He does. It’s a reasonable appointment 
for the Prime Minister to make. I just note, in passing, that when we 
did something similar ourselves, he was very fast off the mark to abuse 
us. We, however, are not fast off the mark to abuse him. It’s not 
an unreasonable appointment.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Did you take Mr Howard’s comments yesterday as recanting 
a little on that earlier criticism?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, it’s the nearest thing he’s ever come to 
admitting error. There are one or two other errors I’d like him to 
admit to, like the mess he’s made of our universities and the mess 
he’s made of our public hospitals. But I suppose if he’s got to 
start somewhere admitting error, he may as well start there.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 On the diplomatic front, the situation with the Indonesian 
President is getting more concerning by the day. What do you think we’ve 
done wrong there, to have this situation where we’re just not getting 
on anymore?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, we’ve taken the right stand on the issue of 
Timor. There’s no question about that. Unfortunately, it’s been 
surrounded by a cloud of other agendas from the Prime Minister. We had 
the ‘deputy sheriff nonsense. We’ve had the Prime Minister getting 
up and expressing scepticism about the quality and content of Australia’s 
engagement with Asia. Foolish stands by the Prime Minister, given that, 
in fact, it denies us all the friends we could have in relation to any 
quarrel we might be having with Indonesia. But, quite clearly, there’s 
a deal of work that needs to be done here. It requires maturity and 
some gravitas by the Australian Government on a number of issues. Take 
the issue of refugees coming to Australia. It is not appropriate for 
people to queue jump, it’s not appropriate for people to exploit it. 
And the policy of opposing that is correct. The problem is the language 
surrounding it. The language surrounding it, frankly, from the Minister 
has been hysterical. And that has obviously attracted a degree of international 
attention and fuelled the capacity of people to score points at our 
expense. Now, Ruddock and the Prime Minister need to watch themselves 
on this. But, in terms of the relationship with Indonesia, I think it’s 
a long-term rebuilding process. And the first stages are going to have 
to be reflected with an emphasis on what you might call ‘second track 
diplomacy’, which is the usage of the people-to-people contacts that 
we’ve built up over the years, which are now massive in number.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But who do you believe in the boat people issue? Do 
you believe the Indonesian President, when he says that John Howard 
never raised it with him, or do you believe John Howard, when he says 
he raised it several times?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, I don’t know who to believe on that or when 
they did it. But the simple fact of the matter is, whoever raised it, 
they’re coming through. There’s no question about that. And what 
it requires is two things from the Australian Government - resolution 
in dealing with the problem, in terms of handling them as they come 
in, and ensuring that those who do get in are actually genuine refugees 
or else they get sent back. 

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 ls there any more Australia should do to get the WTO 
talks back on the rails?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 We need to understand this as Australians: 22 per 
cent of our GDP, nearly a quarter of our GDP, is produced by exports. 
We are talking here about millions of jobs, millions of jobs, and that 
fact that the intentional trading agreements seem to have been put on 
a backburner is bad news for Australia. We have got to do what we can 
to get it back on track and we’ll be pressing the Government to do 
so.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Just finally, Gough Whitlam today before the East 
Timor inquiry. Is his case defensible? Do you think he’ll take it 
up with gusto?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Gough will certainly take it up with gusto. He has 
always defended his point of view at the time and argues that people 
have misled about what it was that he did and said in that period. I 
think, personally, that in order to learn the lessons we need to learn, 
we need to now also look much closer to the date at which we now find 
ourselves. In the last 12 months, we’ve not covered ourselves, diplomatically, 
with glory in this regard. The Government has followed a policy of shooting 
the messenger, in trying to find those who have been leaking on it. 
What the Government ought to be doing is looking and learning at their 
poor performance over the course of the last 12 months. Now, it may 
be something for the aficionados. There may not be all that much interest 
to the Australia people. But unless you learn from the sorts of mistakes 
we’ve been making, you can’t make progress, and you can’t do the 
right thing next time. And it may compromise your capacity to deal with 
what is a very difficult ongoing situation. The Government needs to 
pay far more attention to what it’s done itself and allow its own 
activities to be inquired into instead of persecuting those patriots 
who’ve blown the whistle on them.
