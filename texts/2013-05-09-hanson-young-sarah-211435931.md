 PM needs to visit children in Manus detention  centre   

 The Greens are calling on Prime Minister Julia Gillard to visit the children in the Manus Island  detention centre when she is in Papua New Guinea, while also urging for refugees in Australia to  be given the right to work.   

 “Julia Gillard needs to see the government’s camps of cruelty with her own eyes,” the Greens  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The government’s decisions have real world consequences and the Prime Minister needs to see  the children on Manus Island and show them the care and compassion they deserve by bringing  them back to Australia.   

 “Billions of dollars of tax payers’ money is being spent on detaining these children and the PM  has a responsibility to see the conditions for herself.   

 “The government’s cruelty is not limited to the destitution in its offshore detention centres  however.   

 “I will be moving a motion in the Senate next week recognising refugees’ right to work, and I am  calling on all MPs who are concerned about refugee families living in abject poverty to cross the  floor.    

 “The Greens will continue to stand up for what is right and every member who is genuinely  concerned about the welfare of vulnerable children and families should support the motion.”
