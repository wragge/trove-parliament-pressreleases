 NEWSMINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, y | .  X  LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRSThe Hon. Clyde Holding, M.P. â¼ â¢MPS 63/88 .1988/89 MIGRATION PROGRAM TAILORED TO NATIONAL INTERESTS .Australia will select up to 140 000 new settlers during 1988/89 - an increase of 8000 over the expanded figure for the current year.The Minister for immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Clyde Holding, who announced the 1988/89 immigration intake today, said that while it built on the direction the Government had established for its Migration program, it also allowed for any change in direction which might emerge from the Government's consideration of the report of the committee to Advise on Australia's immigration Policies.The program consists of:Family Migration 35 000Refugee and HumanitarianMigration 12 000.  contingency reserve â¢  2 0.00Economic Migration.  Occupational SharesSystem 8 000.  Employer Nomination Scheme *  ' 10 000.  Business Migration Program 12 000.  independent andConcessional Migration 45 500Special Eligibility 1 500Grant of Resident Status 14 000--  TOTAL 140 000Mr Holding said the Government had maintained its approach of taking both economic and humanitarian factors into account when setting the new level of theParliament House, Canberra

 "We believe the program succeeds in being sensitive to the  needs of Australia's economy as well as acknowledging the  genuine needs of people," he said.

 "The Program recognises Australia's need for skilled and  entrepreneurial migrants who will contribute to our economy.

 "At the same time, we are continuing to show compassion for  those in genuine need of sanctuary and those who seek  reunification with their close relatives.

 "The program has been carefully tailored to serve the national  interest against a background of soaring demand from overseas,   with migration inquiries now running at around one and a  quarter million a year."

 Mr Holding gave these further details of each category:

 "Under family migration we will continue to provide for relaxed  entry of close family members, including spouses, dependent  children and parents," the Minister said.

 The family migration provisions benefited both overseas-born  residents and many people born in Australia who marry overseas  or have close family living overseas.

 "The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to a global -   humanitarian and refugee intake," Mr Holding said.

 However, regional allocations (see Attachment) have been  adjusted to respond to changing circumstances around the world.

 "A key feature of this part of the program is its  responsiveness to real need and the Government's aim is to  ensure that priority is given to the most pressing humanitarian  cases," the Minister said. .

 "Australia's generous refugee resettlement program strongly  complements our international aid program and diplomatic  initiatives. Resettlement is a vital measure, but it is not  the only way, nor always the best way to assist.

 "Australia will continue to work closely with the Office of the  United Nations High commissioner for Refugees, the  Inter-governmental Committee for Migration and other  humanitarian bodies in international efforts to meet the needs  of refugees."

 Mr Holding said the Government had decided to keep the  Occupational Shares System and the Employer Nomination Scheme  in place in 1988/89. These schemes helped ensure that  Australia's skilled migration and domestic training efforts  were working together.

 As for business migration, he said the Business Migration  Program had seen a dramatic increase over the past year, be-ing  expanded from an initial allocation of 3500 places to 8000 

 places.

 "The investment and job creation potential of the program is  very significant," the Minister said.  _

 "The interest shown in the program overseas was sufficient to  increase it to 12 000 for 1988/89.

 "Each principal applicant brings an average of $550 000 to  Australia and their new ventures stimulate employment growth.

 "Australia can expect this program to stimulate business  capital inflow of more than $1.5 billion next year."

 Mr Holding said the Independent and concessional category would  continue to focus on young, skilled and employable migrants,  many of whom had family in Australia.

 "Concessional points are awarded in this category for sponsored  applicants who are the brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces or .   non-dependent children of their sponsors, with bonus points for  a citizen sponsor," he said.

 "Because of the vigorous demand for places, only those  applicants achieving the highest marks will be selected, rather  than all those who meet a fixed passmark.

 "This will apply to both current and new applicants, except in  those cases where preliminary approval has already been  notified."

 Mr Holding said that while the Government regretted that many  applicants would be disappointed, Australia could not afford to  operate an open-door policy.

 "The national interest will be best served by immigrants who  can easily slot into the workforce and make an early  contribution to Australia's economic development," he said.

 Mr Holding also announced that the Government would allocate an  additional $7.5 million in 1988/89 for the expansion of migrant  settlement services and the upgrading of overseas resources,  including computer facilities, to improve immigration 

 processing.

 FAMILY MIGRATION

 Expected outcome 1987/88 :  33 000

 Program 1988/89 :  35 000

 Allows for sponsorship of close family, principally spouses,   dependent children and parents. Selection criteria are  simple; mainly basic health and character requirements. Other  sub-categories include orphaned unmarried relatives, fiancees,   children for adoption, special need relatives,  aged close  relatives and last remaining brothers, sisters and adult  children.

 Sponsors, who in some cases must have resided in Australia for  two years, undertake to provide accommodation and financial  support as necessary.

 This category responds to demand and the program is an estimate  of that demand.

 REFUGEE AND SPECIAL HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM

 Expected outcome 1987/88 :  11 200

 Program 1988/89 :  12 000

 The program is being maintained at 12 000 places, as in recent  years.

 The breakdown by region is anticipated to be:

 Indochinese ...  5 200

 East Europeans 2 300 

 Latin Americans 2 000 

 Middle Easterners 1 600 

 Africans 2.00 

 Others 100 

 Unallocated 600

 The program retains the flexibility to adjust to developments  through the year. As in previous years a contingency reserve  of 2 000 is available should an unforeseen emergency situation  arise requiring an Australian resettlement response.

 Government travel funding will continue to be available for up  to 7 000 persons, passage assistance will be allocated on the  basis of demonstrated humanitarian need.

 5 bonus points are available if the sponsor is an Australian  citizen.

 The former selection mechanism for the I & C category, based on  a fixed pass mark of 70, is replaced by a flexible selection  system which emphasises those scoring highest overall and  performing strongly on the employability factor. Selection  will target applicants scoring 80 or more overall, or 75
