 Media Release    

 Adam Bandt MP  Deputy Leader, Australian Greens  Federal Member for Melbourne

 Bandt welcomes Kennett intervention    

 Greens Deputy Leader and Federal Member for Melbourne Adam Bandt MP has  thanked Jeff Kennett for his intervention in the Melbourne election campaign.    

 Mr Bandt said that the former Liberal Premier’s call for a Labor - Liberal  preference deal in Melbourne has highlighted how close the old parties have  become in their desperation to prevent alternative voices in the Parliament.    

 “Thanks, Jeff.  If he’s now backing my opponent and calling for me to be ‘wiped  out’, I must be doing something right.”    

 “Jeff Kennett endorsing my opponent is the best political advertisement I would  have hoped for. I’ll be putting it on my campaign leaflets.”    

 “Jeff Kennett and Liberal policies, and have voted together on many policies, like  attacking single parents, cutting universities’ funds or sticking to pitifully low  pollution targets. This highlights just how close the old parties have become.”    

 “Our campaign has been built on the assumption Labor and Tony Abbott would  collaborate on preferences. If we continue our strong campaign focused on  standing up for refugees and Labor’s cuts to clean energy and universities, we  will hold this seat regardless of the old parties preference deal.
