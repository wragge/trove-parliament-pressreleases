 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FIVE BOATS AND 654 PEOPLE ARRIVE  ILLEGALLY IN THREE DAYS May 04, 2013

 Two more illegal boat arrivals, with a total of more than 150 people on board, takes to 654 the number of people to have arrived in just the first three days of May, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Fresh from two consecutive record months for illegal boat arrivals including almost 3,400 people arriving in April, Labor’s  failed border protection policies have seen five boats arrive in just three days this month with a total of over 650 people on board,” Mr Morrison said.

 “The budget is in less than two weeks and Labor will have to fess up to another blow out on our borders, having originally only budgeted for 5,400 illegal boat arrivals this year and then revising that number to 12,000 in February.

 “These latest boats now take this financial year’s arrivals to almost 20,000, by far the biggest financial year for illegal boats on record and it still has almost two whole months to run.

 “These increased arrivals under Labor’s failed border protection policies mean not only increased budget blow outs to be financed by Australian taxpayers, they also raise the risk of further tragedies at sea,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “In the first 3 days of May there have already been 5 boats, carrying 654 people, intercepted in Australian waters.

 “The Government continues to hide behind their Malaysian swap deal as an excuse to do nothing to solve the crisis at our borders.

 “At the current rate of arrivals the entire quota for the Malaysia swap deal would be reached within a few days, proving that it would have no impact on the people smuggling business model.

 “The Australian people are sick of this Government’s excuses and come September 14 they will have the option to voice their opinions on how Labor has handled this border protection fiasco,” Mr Keenan said.
