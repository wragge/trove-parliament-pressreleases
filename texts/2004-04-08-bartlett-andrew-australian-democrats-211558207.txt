 DEMOCRATS 

 MEDIA     INTRODUCING THE NEXT VICTORIAN DEMOCRAT SENATOR    Australian Democrats Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, and Deputy Leader and Senator for Victoria, Lyn Allison, are today launching the campaign of Ms Jess Healy, the partyâ€™s lead Senate candidate in Victoria.   Ms Healy, who works in book publicity, is a former school captain and a strong social justice campaigner. Currently 19, she would enter the Parliament at the age of 20, becoming the youngest person ever elected, if the Democrats  win another Senate seat in Victoria.   The Democrats have led with the first female leader (Janine Haines), youngest leader (Natasha Stott Despoja), youngest women elected (Roslyn Dundas), first gay activist elected (Brian Greig) and currently the only Indigenous person in Federal Parliament (Aden Ridgeway).  "The Democrats have always brought diversity to the Parliament and have been the first to recognise the contribution young people can make as representatives and legislators, if given the opportunity," said Senator Bartlett.  "Jess Healy is well suited to a role in the Senate because of her maturity, tenacity, commitment to social justice and drive to be part of the Democrats' strong and serious team in the balance of power," he said.  Senator Lyn Allison says, "The members have selected a young woman to stand in a winnable seat and have every confidence in Jess Healy to win and do the job well.    "I expect Jess to bring fresh insights and ideas into a parliament still dominated by older male representation."  Democrats Senate Candidate, Jess Healy has specific policy interests in education, unemployment, poverty, asylum-seekers, environment and political accountability.  She says, "I am standing for the Democrats in the Senate because I don't want any more government policies built on fear and lies and I don't want any more government policies that target vulnerable people in our society.  "The Government has ignored social justice and the Opposition has helped them erode young people's access to education and opportunities to live as independent people," Ms Healy says.
