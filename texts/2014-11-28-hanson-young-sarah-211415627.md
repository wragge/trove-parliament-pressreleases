 MEDIA RELEASE

 Australia condemns gay refugees in PNG   

 Gay refugees on Manus Island will be attacked and imprisoned if resettled in the PNG  community, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Physical attacks and lengthy prison sentences; that’s the reality facing gay refugees the Abbott  government has dumped on Manus Island,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “People who have fled their home countries because they’re gay will now face imprisonment in  PNG because of the Australians government’s actions.   

 “Homosexuality is a crime in PNG and it carries a shocking maximum sentence of 14 years in  jail. The Abbott government’s lack of concern for the very people it should be protecting is  extremely troubling.   

 “Gay men are already unsafe inside the Manus camp and the government is trying to resettle  them in a community where their sexuality is considered a serious criminal offence.   

 “When it comes to people seeking protection from war and persecution, the Manus Island camp  is not the answer and it needs to be shut down.   

 “We should be working with our neighbours in the region, accelerating refugee processing and  increasing Australia’s intake so that people are given a safe way to reach protection. That’s the  only way we can save lives at sea while caring for refugees.”
