 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 19 August 2014   

 Manus murder charge should see detention camp closed   

 The arrest and charge of two Manus Island detention camp employees for the murder of Reza Barati  should see the centre closed, the Australian Greens have said.   

 â€œWith Australian government funded employees facing murder charges, it's time for Manus to be  closed," the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 "The brutal attacks and the inexplicable delay in laying these charges show why the Manus camp is  untenable.   

 "Reza Barati was murdered by the very people who were employed to care for him and keep him  safe. This cannot be allowed to happen again.   

 "After ignoring repeated warnings from staff and experts, the Abbott government has been  desperate to blame anyone but themselves for this tragedy.   

 "The ongoing Senate inquiry into the attacks has shown how the government failed in its duty of  care on Manus and is unable to guarantee the safety of staff and refugees who are there now.   

 "Closing the camp will save billions of dollars and is the only way to guarantee that there won't be  another tragedy like this in the future."
