 Minister fails to understand his own defence  capability plan   September 21, 2011 

 The Defence Minister should read his own Defence Capability Plan before firing off a missive at the Coalition and not 

 rely upon second hand reports from the media. 

 

 The Coalition committed in the 2010 election campaign to rejoining the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) 

 project and providing three Global Hawks with the appropriate ground station to operate the platform - nothing has 

 changed from that position. 

 

 Shadow Defence Minister David Johnston said it was the Labor Government who scuttled this leading edge 

 technology in 2009, subsequently realised it was a dumb move and re-ordered them - putting us to the end of the 

 acquisition queue with the heavy penalty of not being able purchase these state-of-the-art aircraft until 2022.  

 

 “Joel Fitzgibbon as Defence Minister cancelled the order for this unmanned aircraft after ten years of development 

 and $100 million of taxpayers’ money was invested on what is considered worldwide as leading edge technology,” 

 Senator Johnston said. 

 

 The Minister only has to look at his own Defence Capability Plan and see that the Labor Government has committed 

 $1 to $2 billion to purchase seven of these aircraft sometime between 2022 and 2025. 

 

 Senator Johnston said the Global Hawk aircraft was ideally suited to patrolling the North-West of WA because it can 

 survey as much as 100,000 sq/km of terrain a day and fly for 42 hours without returning to base. 

 

 “It is far more cost effective to use BAMS to safeguard oil and gas infrastructure, as well as monitor illegal fishing and 

 illegal boat arrivals,” he said. 

 

 Senator Johnston said at no time did he say that the Coalition was going to cut the proposed Joint Strike Fighter 

 (JSF)  fleet by half to fifty, this report is also factually wrong. 

 

 “If the Minister is committed to spending $36 billion on 12 large submarines of a type that has never been built 

 anywhere in the world then he should immediately commit to this expenditure - to coin a Hollywood phrase - show 

 us the money,” Senator Johnston said. 

 

 “What is perplexing is that Labor has never put forward a proper business or economic case with respect to its grand 

 vision of 12 large conventionally powered submarines.”  

 

 “There is a strong case to build our future submarines in South Australia and this has consistently been our position,” 

 Senator Johnston said. 

 

  “An in-country build of a proven submarine design is an option that must be fully considered by whoever is in 

 government. Such an approach could provide benefit across the South Australian manufacturing sector and serve as 

 a foundation for future submarine sustainment and enhancement.” 

 

 “The Coalition is committed to restoring our submarine capability as our first line of defence and that includes our 

 Future Submarine project.”
