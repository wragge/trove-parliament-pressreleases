 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE

 New report shows changing face of migration to Australia   

 The Asia region is becoming a leading source for permanent migration to  Australia according to Australia’s Migration Trends, a new report released today  by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Brendan O’Connor.   

 The report contains comprehensive analysis and commentary on migration  activity for 2011-12, and provides a clear picture of substantial changes in the  origins of Australia’s migrants, reflecting the trend towards an Asian Century.   

 For the first time, India and China were the two main source countries of  permanent migrants.   

 “Seven of the top 10 source countries in 2011-12 were located in the Asia  region,” Mr O’Connor said.   

 “Between 1996 and 2011, Australia’s overseas-born population grew by more  than 40 per cent to reach six million. This was more than double the rate for the  Australian-born population and is essential in addressing the demographic  challenges of an ageing population,” Mr O’Connor said.   

 “With the government’s strong emphasis on skilled migration, this sort of growth  is also crucial to ensuring depth in Australia’s labour force.   

 Mr O’Connor said patterns of migration are also changing.   

 “In 2011-12, half of Australia’s skilled migrants applied while they were already  living in Australia on a temporary visa. This was more than twice the rate of a  decade earlier and reflects a growing trend of migrants seeing what Australia has  to offer before making a commitment to settle permanently,” Mr O’Connor said.   

 “There is also clear evidence of Australia’s commitment to international refugee  protection.  By granting more than 13 700 humanitarian visas in 2011-12,  Australia continued to earn its place as one of the top three resettlement  countries in the world, along with Canada and the USA.     

 “These and other findings, along with extensive policy discussion make  Australia’s Migration Trends essential reading for anyone wanting to learn more  about migration’s role in our society and its importance to Australia’s future.”
