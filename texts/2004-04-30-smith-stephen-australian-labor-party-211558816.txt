 GOVERNMENT HAS THE BLINKERS ON WHEN IT COMES TO THE  ‘PACIFIC SOLUTION’   

 The Howard Government continues to refuse to accept responsibility for it’s so called  ‘Pacific Solution’.   

 Reports today of the Government’s children in detention policy and the overall cost of  their immigration detention program, fail to acknowledge the existence of nearly 300  people in detention on Nauru, of which over 80 are children.   

 Information provided by the Department to media on the number of children in detention  did not include the children detained in Nauru.   

 Reports today that the daily cost of the Government’s immigration detention system is  $400,000 a day also does not include the cost of the ‘Pacific Solution’.   

 The Government refuses to acknowledge the extravagant cost of detention for people  being held in Nauru and Manus Island.   

 John Howard’s ‘Pacific Solution’ reached the point earlier this year where it was costing  over $200,000 a month to keep one asylum seeker on Manus Island.  The lone asylum  seeker remains on Manus Island today. 

 

 Senate Estimates in February this year revealed the Government has spent $170 million  so far on the ‘Pacific Solution’.  It was also revealed the Howard Government has  budgeted an additional $300 million, to make a total of $470 million for the ‘Pacific  Solution’ over a four year period.   

 Labor again calls on the Government to close Nauru and Manus Island now.  Labor  would respond constructively to transitional arrangements the Government might suggest  on announcing the closure.
