 Australia’s Humanitarian Excellence Continues 

 VPS 012/2005

 Australia has maintained its place in the top three countries in the world for resettling people in need of refugee and humanitarian aid,  Minister for Immigration Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 Between July and November 2004, Australia granted close to 5000 visas to resettle people who were in need of refugee and  humanitarian aid. 

 By the end of financial year, it is expected that about 13 000 people will have been granted visas under the Refugee and Humanitarian  Program. The Program this year includes a 50 per cent increase in the refugee component of the program from 4000 to 6000 people.

 ‘Australia spends about $500 million a year on support and services for those in most desperate need of resettlement. That’s $2 billion  over a four year budget cycle.

 ‘This commitment solidifies and maintains Australia’s place as one of the top three countries in the world with a dedicated refugee and  humanitarian resettlement program.

 ‘Rolled over vacancies from previous years meant that Australia’s 2003-04 Refugee and Humanitarian Program reached an eight-year  high of 13 851 visas, demonstrating that Australia is committed to providing this assistance. 

 ‘The majority of the visas granted so far this year have been granted to people in Africa. Refugees waiting in camps in places like the  Sudan are expected account for about 70 per cent of all people resettled in Australia under the program this financial year,’ the Minister  said.

 ‘These are the people in most desperate need of resettlement according to the UNHCR.

 ‘The amount of time it takes to grant a visa has fallen with 75 percent of visas granted last year taking 57 weeks to process, down from  64 weeks in 2002-03 and 101 weeks in 2001-02.

 ‘The coming years will see Australia maintain its position as one of the leading countries in the world in providing refugee and  humanitarian resettlement assistance,’ the Minister said.
