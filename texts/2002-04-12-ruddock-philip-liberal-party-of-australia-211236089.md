 Minister's Visit to Discuss Border Protection and Migration MPS 27/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock will discuss issues ranging from border protection, to tourism and the international asylum system during a visit taking in Europe, China and West Asia.

 One of the significant aspects of the visit will be to attend the European Union Ministerial Consultations in Brussels next week, as part of the Australian delegation.

 While in the People's Republic of China, Mr Ruddock will hold discussions on people to people relationships, including further development of China as a tourist source country and the strong and managed growth in student numbers out of the PRC. In the past year, student visa grants from China have grown 66%.

 He will also have discussions about continuing cooperation between the two countries in combating people smuggling issues.

 "We appreciate the excellent working relations we have with China on these issues, reflected in strong increases in legitimate travel and effective action against illegal movements," Mr Ruddock said.

 In London, Mr Ruddock will address the Commonwealth Lawyers Association on the topic, "Hard Choices - the asylum seeker challenge".

 The Minister will also head the Australian delegation for the opening session of the Stockholm International Forum "Truth, Justice and Reconciliation".

 Issues of refugee resettlement, the problems faced by countries of first asylum and the irregular movement of people will be discussed with a number of countries.

 "The recent Bali Ministerial Conference on people smuggling demonstrated that Governments have common concerns about irregular movements," Mr Ruddock said.

 The visit will include discussions with Pakistan and Iran which have both struggled under the burden of millions of refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq in recent years.
