 Sri Lankans granted humanitarian entry 

 Friday, 11 January 2008 

 A group of Sri Lankan refugees on Nauru will be resettled in  Australia next week following completion of final health and  character checks. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Evans, said today that 21 Sri Lankans currently housed at the  Offshore Processing Centre in Nauru would travel to Australia as  part of the humanitarian resettlement program.  

 'These people have been found to be refugees by my department  under the Refugees Convention and will receive support through  the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy to establish their  lives in Australia,' Senator Evans said. 

 The 21 people arriving next week are the first of a group of 75 Sri  Lankan refugees on Nauru that will be resettled in Australia in the  coming weeks. 

 They will be settled in capital cities, including those where some of  the refugees have existing family support. 

 Decisions on seven other Sri Lankans on Nauru are pending. One  person was refused refugee status and his case is under review.  Six people are facing criminal charges in Nauru and will remain in  the processing centre until these matters are resolved by the  Nauru justice system. 

 'Australia remains one of the top three refugee resettlement  countries in the world, welcoming about 13 000 refugees each  year,' Senator Evans said. 

 'We remain committed to supporting a well-managed refugee  resettlement program.' 

 The Australian Government will shortly invite the Government of  Nauru to commence formal discussions on the closure of the  Offshore Processing Centre on Nauru. 

 The Government will carefully consider the likely impact of closure  of the facility. Australia continues to honour its commitment to a  generous aid and capacity development program for Nauru. 

 'While the Government is ending the Pacific solution with the  closure of the centre on Nauru, Christmas Island will soon have an  increased capacity for offshore processing of unauthorised  arrivals,' Senator Evans said. 

 'The Government remains committed to strong border security,  tough anti-people smuggling measures and the orderly processing
