 Media Release   

 Monday, 15 October 2012   

 Estimates reveal immigration network failings   

 A quickly assembled, poorly thought through and thoroughly inadequate immigration network has  been revealed in Senate Estimates today, the Australian Greens said.   

 “It is now more obvious than ever that this cobbled together, inadequate immigration network is  unable to deal with the boats that are still arriving every day,” Australian Greens immigration  spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The previous weekend’s arrivals alone are almost enough to completely fill the Manus Island  detention centre, which isn’t even built yet.   

 “The events of the last few days have shown that desperate and vulnerable people are still doing  whatever they can to seek asylum in Australia and that obviously won’t change until we give them  safer pathways.   

 “The Government’s ‘deterrence measures’ aren’t working and they need to begin to enact the  recommendations of the Greens by bringing more refugees screened by UNHCR into the country  from Indonesia and Malaysia.   

 “Today’s questioning has shown that this hasn’t happened yet and again I simply ask Minister  Bowen, why not?   

 “The Manus Island detention centre is expected to host detainees within weeks and it was revealed  during estimates today that there is no contract in place, but there is a Letter of Intent showing that  the controversial security firm G4S could be in charge.   

 “This is the company that botched the security at the Olympic Games, failed to properly screen a  member of their own security forces in Iraq who went on to kill two colleagues, one of whom was  Australian, and oversaw the death in custody of Aboriginal Elder, Mr Ward in Western Australia.”
