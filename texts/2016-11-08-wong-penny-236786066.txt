 BUILDING BRIDGES NOT WALLS - THE CASE FOR AN OPEN AUSTRALIA    

 NATIONAL PRESS CLUB  CANBERRA    

 8 NOVEMBER 2016 

 

 *****PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY*****   

 INTRODUCTION 

 On Australia Day every year, in ceremonies around the nation, thousands of people 

 become Australian citizens. 

 They pledge their respect for Australia’s democratic values, freedoms and laws. 

 We, in turn, welcome them as fellow citizens of one of the world’s most diverse, 

 tolerant and open societies - a society where one in every four people was born 

 overseas. 

 Australians look to the world beyond our shores. 

 Every year, millions of us travel overseas to work, study, holiday and visit family and 

 friends. 

 Our economy is open. 

 Imports and exports account for 40 per cent of economic activity, and millions of jobs 

 rely on trade with the rest of the world. 

 The benefits of Australia’s openness are all around us every day. 

 In fact our openness is so fundamental to our prosperity and our very identity as a 

 nation that we take it for granted. 

 Yet it was not always so. 

 For most of the 20th century we maintained the racially-discriminatory White 

 Australia migration policy and high tariff barriers, which raised the cost of living for 

 working people and led to the stagnation of our industries. 

 Despite the distance we have travelled since then, there are some today who want to 

 return to those failed policies of the past. 

 There are political parties advocating bans on immigrants based on their religion. 

 There are demands for the imposition of protectionist barriers on our economy. 

 There are calls to cut assistance to the world’s poorest people. 

 And a mentality that wants Australia to pull back from international engagement 

 through the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. 

 Those who advocate these policies want Australia to regress to being a closed 

 society, sealed off from the rest of the world. 

 Their agenda is one of economic autarky, political intolerance, and international 

 isolationism. 

 It is an agenda which would see Australia compromising its values as an open, 

 liberal, tolerant democracy. 

 It is also an agenda which, in truth, can never be delivered. 

 The world’s nations, our economies, our ideas, our security are connected 

 regardless of the divisions that some seek to construct. 

 Such an approach, like Canute and the tide, cannot succeed. 

 But much damage can be done in attempts to effect it. 

 The advocates of a closed Australia are on the march - on the airwaves, on social 

 media, and in the Parliament. 

 Their slogans may comfort a few, but are answers for none. 

 And great harm flows from the peddling of intolerance that is their stock in trade. 

 It is in this political context that I want to speak to you today about the importance of 

 preserving Australia’s identity as an open, outward-looking, optimistic country. 

 I want to make the case that an open Australia is critical for our security, for our 

 prosperity, for the fairness of our society, and for our values as Australians. 

 

 

 THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS (NEW) ENEMIES 

 This is not a new debate. 

 The merits of open versus closed societies have been ventilated many times over 

 the years. 

 One of the most important of these analyses is Karl Popper’s The Open Society and 

 its Enemies. 

 Popper wrote his defence of freedom and democracy in the early 1940s while he 

 was teaching in New Zealand, a long way from his native Austria and the 

 ascendancy of European fascism. 

 He traces the distinction between open and closed societies through the history of 

 ideas back to Ancient Greece and the rise and fall of Athenian democracy. 

 In this account, closed societies are characterised by hierarchy, class, custom and 

 authority. 

 They repress individual freedom in the name of the group or the tribe, and its ruling 

 institutions and authorities. 

 They are closed both to external influences and to internal freedoms. 

 By contrast, open societies are characterised by democratic values and individual 

 liberties. 

 They pursue social, political and scientific progress, encourage debate and the 

 contest of ideas, and values of equality, cooperation and tolerance. 

 In the classical world, the open versus closed dichotomy was epitomised by the 

 contrast between cosmopolitan, democratic Athens and oligarchic, traditional Sparta. 

 When Popper was writing, the contrast was between liberal democracies and 

 totalitarian regimes. 

 Today, the new enemies of the open society include fanatical terrorists who seek to 

 impose a distorted view of Islam and foment a clash of civilisations. 

 Terrorist attacks in western countries are designed to create fear and curtail our 

 freedoms - they are a direct attack on the open nature of our societies. 

 But it should never be forgotten that the most numerous victims of radical Islamist 

 terrorists are the many thousands of Muslims targeted in attacks in developing 

 countries around the world. 

 Open societies also face new challenges from the forces of political populism, 

 cultural nativism, international isolationism and economic protectionism - forces 

 which are on the rise in many advanced economies. 

 And while they do not pose the same threat to open societies as terrorism, they do 

 represent an attempt to wind back the values and the benefits of openness. 

 They reflect pressures arising from sluggish economic growth, the impact of 

 globalisation, the most profound refugee crisis since the Second World War, and 

 shifts in the global balance of power. 

 They have been manifested in developments such as the Brexit vote, support for 

 anti-immigration parties in Europe, and the nature of this year’s US presidential 

 contest. 

 Australia escaped the worst ravages of the global financial crisis thanks to strong 

 economic institutions, decisive action by the Rudd Government to provide economic 

 stimulus and our trade relationships with China and other Asian economies. 

 We are also fortunate to be geographically insulated from conflicts that trouble many 

 other parts of the world. 

 But there are still understandable anxieties amongst our people about globalisation, 

 economic change and terrorism. 

 Unfortunately there are many in our political system seeking to exploit these 

 anxieties. 

 So we need to better explain the benefits of openness to our people. 

 We need to develop policies to ensure those benefits are shared fairly. 

 And we need to demonstrate that security comes from international cooperation and 

 engagement, not from withdrawal from the world. 

 

 SECURITY THROUGH OPENNESS 

 An open Australia will be more secure than a closed Australia. 

 For many, this statement is counter-intuitive. Walls may seem safer than bridges. 

 Perhaps Paul Keating articulated this principle best when he said that Australia 

 needs to seek its security in Asia rather than from Asia. 

 No matter how fortified the castle’s walls, its security hinges on its relationships with 

 its neighbours and the extent of its alliances. 

 Australia’s national interest is best served by engaging with the world. 

 We need strong relationships with other countries to maintain security and to ensure 

 cooperation on global challenges. 

 As a middle power, Australia has a direct interest in an open, rules-based 

 international order in which countries work together to resolve tensions and to tackle 

 global problems. 

 When countries close themselves off, turn inward and disengage from the world, the 

 risks of misunderstanding, tension, rivalry and conflict rise. 

 Security challenges are best met by working with other countries rather than in 

 isolation. 

 Australia’s alliance with the United States is one of the central pillars of our foreign 

 and defence policies. 

 So is our network of relationships with the countries of our region. 

 And our participation in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions which 

 underpin the international rules-based order also contributes to our domestic 

 security. 

 Efforts by our law enforcement and security agencies to meet the threat of terrorist 

 attacks are bolstered by international cooperation, including sharing intelligence 

 information. 

 And terrorism is just one of a raft of challenges which straddle international borders 

 and which therefore require international cooperation - challenges like health 

 pandemics, natural disasters, climate change and environmental degradation, cyber 

 security, people smuggling, organised crime and international tax avoidance. 

 Those who advocate a closed Australia would hamper our ability to tackle challenges 

 like these, which require countries to work together, across international borders. 

 

 OPENNESS AND PROSPERITY 

 An open Australia will be more prosperous than a closed Australia. 

 By trading with the rest of the world, Australia lifts its rate of economic growth and 

 improves its competitiveness and efficiency. 

 By trading with the rest of the world, Australia creates jobs - and jobs that rely on 

 trade are typically better-paid, more productive and more secure jobs. 

 And by trading with the rest of the world, Australia delivers lower prices and greater 

 choice for its consumers. 

 The benefits of an open Australian economy extend beyond trade to other forms of 

 international economic engagement - collaboration with international partners on 

 R&D; international purchasing and licensing of intellectual property; and scope for 

 our firms to invest and establish operations in overseas markets. 

 An open Australian economy also has access to global financial markets as a source 

 of investment capital. 

 Tapping into foreign investment allows us to use the savings of other countries to 

 finance investment in our own country. 

 This, in turn, allows us to enjoy higher living standards now and into the future, by 

 financing investment which will lead to higher growth. 

 So turning our backs on the global economy would lead to slower growth, a less 

 productive economy, less sustainable industries and jobs, lower investment, higher 

 prices and less choice for consumers. 

 It would not only ignore the economic case, it would also ignore the moral case for 

 trade. 

 It’s a moral case grounded in the fact that economic growth, trade and globalisation 

 have improved the living standards of the world’s poorest people - in the last two 

 decades more than a billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty. 

 But those of us who advocate open economies must not ignore the impacts of 

 international competition on industries and communities. 

 While trade has delivered significant economic benefits, not all trade agreements are 

 equal - Australia needs to negotiate high-quality trade agreements which deliver 

 genuine benefits to our economy, our businesses and our people. 

 For while it is true that trade liberalisation benefits the economy as a whole, making 

 everybody better off in the medium term, it is also true that some people will be 

 worse off, especially in the short-term. 

 We need to respond to these impacts - not by seeking to close Australia off, but by 

 sharing the benefits fairly and helping people through the transitions. 

 Part of supporting the open economy is assisting with economic change through 

 policies which invest in people’s futures rather than treating displaced workers as 

 frictional costs. 

 Maintaining support for an open Australian economy requires investing in education 

 and skills. 

 It requires structural adjustment assistance for industries and regions affected by 

 economic change and training and active labour market programs for workers. 

 And it requires a progressive safety net of minimum wages, social welfare and 

 universal healthcare - all policies which are central to the Labor agenda, but which 

 the Liberals have attacked and undermined. 

 At a time when some regions are suffering from high unemployment and when 

 working people are experiencing slow wages growth, we need to respond to 

 concerns about the impacts of globalisation, not by erecting protectionist barriers but 

 by ensuring our policies promote inclusive growth and opportunity for the future. 

 

 AN OPEN SOCIETY IS A JUST SOCIETY 

 An open Australia will be a fairer, more tolerant and just society. 

 Open societies encourage social mobility. 

 They promote individual freedoms and equality of their citizens before the law. 

 And they respect the rights of minorities, recognising that a society’s true values are 

 on display in how it treats those who are different or disadvantaged. 

 Contemporary Australia’s diversity - which in large part reflects our successful post-War immigration program - is a source of social, cultural and economic strength. 

 It brings fresh perspectives, fosters creativity and drives innovation - all keys to our 

 future prosperity. 

 In addition to cultural enrichment, migration also delivers economic benefits. 

 It boosts demand, and brings in new sources of savings and capital along with new 

 skills, technologies and ideas. 

 Migrants bring knowledge and contacts in international markets, which strengthen 

 our trade relations and broaden our business horizons. 

 A more diverse workforce gives Australia a competitive advantage in the global 

 economy. 

 And, at a time when an ageing population is creating fiscal pressures, immigration 

 can provide a demographic safety valve. 

 The Productivity Commission has estimated that maintaining migration at our 

 historical rates will increase Australia’s per capita GDP by 7 per cent by 2060 

 compared to a scenario of zero net migration. 

 That’s an extra $7,000 for every Australian man, woman and child in current dollars 

 compared to zero net migration - which is the policy of One Nation. 

 In 1996, Pauline Hanson claimed, falsely, that Australia was being swamped by 

 Asians. 

 Now she claims, falsely, that Australia is in danger of being swamped by Muslims. 

 One Nation wants to shut down migration to Australia based on racial and religious 

 prejudice. 

 It wants to turn back history, to restore Australia to some imagined earlier state as a 

 uniform, homogenous, static society. 

 This is not just a narrow-minded and impoverished vision for the future. 

 It is also based on a myth about Australia’s past. 

 The myth of a uniformly Anglo-Saxon Australia airbrushes out of our history the 

 Afghan camel drivers, the Chinese working the gold fields, the Japanese pearl divers 

 and the hundreds of thousands of Irish migrants who came here during the 19th 

 century. 

 It blots out the Pacific Islanders brought here to work the cane-fields. 

 And it ignores the Holocaust survivors and refugees who made a new life in Australia 

 after the Second World War. 

 Let alone the centuries of shared history, trade and cultural links between Indigenous 

 Australians and the Macassan traders of the Indonesian archipelago. 

 Paul Keating argued, back in 1996, that Pauline Hanson’s regressive politics 

 perpetrates a myth and a lie: “The myth of the monoculture. The lie that we can 

 retreat to it.” 

 The vast majority of Australians are not racist, xenophobic or intolerant. 

 However, fear of change, fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, is an 

 understandable human instinct, especially when it is fanned by xenophobes pushing 

 a political agenda. 

 Yet prejudice rarely survives personal connection. 

 World Bank researchers have shown that people who know a refugee are 

 significantly more likely to say that their country has a responsibility to help 

 immigrants. 

 By contrast, people who do not know a refugee are more likely to say they are 

 worried about migrants taking jobs, changing the host country’s culture or posing 

 security threats. 

 This highlights the importance of integration programs and the need to foster 

 dialogue, and cross-cultural and interfaith relationships. 

 But what is needed most is leadership. 

 Political, business and community leaders who will speak up. 

 Who will remind us that migration has built this nation. 

 Who will demonstrate the optimism and dynamism of our diversity. 

 And who will stand up for those communities who are today’s targets. 

 

 AUSTRALIA IN THE WORLD 

 During the first episode of Hansonism, when it was Asians we were being swamped 

 by, my western-educated father called me from Malaysia. 

 He asked if I needed to migrate back to the country of my birth because we were no 

 longer welcome in Australia. 

 Years later, as a Minister, when I visited Asia during and after the development and 

 publication of the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, I was often asked 

 about the Government’s decision to do this work. 

 That Australia was considering and articulating its place in, and relationship with, 

 Asia was seen positively (and met on occasion with a degree of surprise). 

 These personal experiences remind us that our domestic politics do get refracted 

 into our region. 

 In recent months, the election of One Nation to the Senate has been reported widely 

 outside Australia. 

 The coverage does not cast Australia in a favourable light. 

 The views of One Nation and other hard right political forces resonate abroad - they 

 affect Australia’s reputation in the region. 

 Leaders from both major political parties have worked to build and strengthen 

 Australia’s relations in Asia. 

 Their work, over time, has enhanced our standing in the region. 

 So it damages us all when these voices undermine the positive reputation so many 

 Australians, in government, business, academia and cultural institutions, have 

 worked to build. 

 But it is not only through poor press that this discourse of a closed Australia affects 

 our international relations. 

 Foreign policy is axiomatically the protection and advancement of the national 

 interest. 

 The identification and elaboration of the national interest is a subject for another 

 time. 

 However, in part, foreign policy also involves the expression of national identity. 

 An inward-looking, fearful Australia is not who we are, nor who we have been. 

 Australia has long been an outward-looking, confident and engaged international 

 citizen, advocating our values in international forums and taking our responsibilities 

 seriously. 

 Australia was there at the formation of the United Nations in the aftermath of the 

 Second World War, helping to construct an international order based on peace, 

 security and cooperation rather than isolation, rivalry and conflict. 

 Australia was there when the world developed new concepts of human rights, 

 negotiating international treaties advancing the causes of equality, freedom and 

 justice. 

 Australia supported independence for the people of Indonesia in the 1940s and for 

 the people of Timor-Leste in the dark days of 1999. 

 Our citizens were there for campaigns to end apartheid and bring justice to South 

 Africa. 

 Our defence force personnel have supported peace-keeping and nation-building in 

 places wracked by conflict, such as Bosnia, Bougainville, Rwanda, Somalia and 

 Cambodia. 

 And we have played key roles in international initiatives to make the world a safer 

 place, ranging from nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament to the development of 

 the Responsibility to Protect doctrine. 

 Australians believe in extending a helping hand to those who are less well off - at 

 home and abroad. 

 As Ben Chifley put it: “We have a great objective - the light on the hill - which we 

 aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere 

 we may give a helping hand.” 

 Australia provides humanitarian aid around the world, both in response to immediate 

 crises and to promote economic development to lift people out of poverty. 

 Even as the Abbott and Turnbull Governments have scaled back official 

 development assistance, hundreds of thousands of Australians have continued 

 reaching into their own pockets to donate to charities to help people around the 

 world. 

 Australia has always been especially generous in helping our neighbours when 

 natural disasters strike. 

 And lending a helping hand turns out to be a two-way street. 

 When bushfires have ravaged Australian communities we have seen our local 

 firefighters joined by counterparts from half way around the world in helping to save 

 lives and property. 

 Australia’s foreign policy needs to be firmly grounded in our national interests - and 

 these interests are best advanced through engagement with the world. 

 Australia’s foreign policy also needs to reflect our values, our commitment to making 

 the world a better place - and an open Australia can advance these values abroad. 

 

 CONCLUSION 

 If we are to maintain an open Australia we cannot sit by while those who want to pull 

 down the shutters foment anxiety and fear. 

 History shows that regimes which seek to turn their countries into fortresses against 

 the outside world all too often end up turning them into prisons for their own people. 

 If we build barriers against the rest of the world, the next step is to start building 

 barriers between ourselves, to segment and divide and separate our people and our 

 communities. 

 Prejudice and fear can tear a community apart, but they can never build one - no 

 country in the world has ever become stronger and safer by targeting people 

 because of their ethnicity or religion. 

 To avoid this dismal scenario, we need to affirm our values of tolerance and diversity 

 and to maintain our commitment to economic reform and social fairness. 

 We need to advocate for the benefits of openness and explain the opportunities for 

 the future that will come from international engagement. 

 We need to ensure the benefits of globalisation and interconnectedness are shared 

 fairly. 

 And we need to understand the consequences of turning our backs on the world: 

 â¢          Diminished capacity to influence international affairs, pursue our national interests 

 and tackle global challenges. 

 â¢          Higher living costs, lower investment, slower growth and less prosperity. 

 â¢          And the risk of compromising our basic Australian characteristics of decency, 

 generosity and confidence in the future. 

 An open Australia will be a more prosperous, more secure and more united country. 

 A closed Australia will be a poorer, less secure and more divided place. 

 The choice is ours.
