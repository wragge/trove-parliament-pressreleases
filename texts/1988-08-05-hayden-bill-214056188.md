 AT

 Ro y a l  Y o r k  H o t e l ,  T o r o n t o  

 Au g u s t  4, 1988

 Ch e c k  a g a i n s t  d e l i v e r y

 O ne of the great virtues of Australia ' s Bicentenary  celebration  

 is the new light it has thrown  on the extensive  and close

 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA,

 Australians  have thoroughly  appreciated  C anada' s contribution  

 to the celebrations  back home,

 I CAN VOUCH FOR the DEEP APPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN

 Parliament  of C anada' s gifts of the President ' s C hair for

 the Senate and the C lerk' s table for the H ouse of R epresentatives

 in our new Parliament  H ouse.

 The M ounties' band war naturally  AN EareC1  ally po pu lar  

 part of our Bicentennial  a c t iv it ie s ,

 Canada' s participatio n  in the Brisbane  Expo recalled  for 

 me my own v is it here in 1986 which allowed  me to see your 

 own superb W orld Expo in Vancouver .

 The v is it of your D eputy Prime M in is te r, M r M azankowski , 

 and h is participatio n  in C anada' s naiiun al  day at Expo

 WAS Î NOTABLE CVCNT LAST MONTH IN Î’ Îº iSHANE.

 I KNOW HE WAS STRUCK BY THE SIM ILA RITY  BETWEEN OUR TWO 

 COUNTRIES IN THEIR H I S T O R Y .  THFIR fULTliRAL DIVEDCITY AND 

 NATIONAL ETHOS. "

 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THXT HE CLAIMS CREDIT FOR THE GOOD RAINS 

 WHICH FELL IN OUTBACK QUEENSLAND DURING HIS V IS IT  TO MY

 home S tate - tiic Î³Î¹Ï,Î¿Ï really delcni call in the area for

 MORE THAN TWO YEARS. . ·

 W e do n' t m in d  his taking the kudos for t h is.

 If he can act the rainmaker  as he did I AST month , he can

 COME BACK ANY TIME HE LIKES.

 Canada and Australia  have always  had this kind of close

 RELATIONSHIP,

 O ur POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT over the PAST 100 YEARS has been

 QUITE SIM ILAR, . 

 â¢ >. · ·

 Canada even made some notable  ( if unusual ) contributions  

 to our earliest  national  development ,

 The first government - assisted  emigration  to Australia  from 

 Br it a in after the end of convict  transportation  was ba se d

 ON THE PRACTICE OF SHIPPING POOR BRITONS TO WORK IN THE.

 Canadian  forests .

 The REASON FOR both developments  was THE SAME: TO relieve 

 SOCIAL TENSION IN BRITAIN CREATED BY THE EFFECTS OF LAND 

 ENCLOSURES AND THE NEW INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS,

 About 140 C anadian  "patriotes " (as they were called) were

 TRANSPORTED TO AUSTRALIA FOR REBELLING AGAINST THE BRITISH

 authorities  in Canada, â  ·

 They returned  to C anada after their unwilling  contribution  

 to Australia ' s development .

 W e' ve never really understood  why.

 Perhaps  it was because  they were so scandalised  by our 

 rough and licentious  ways at the tim e, according  to the 

 journal  kept by one of them,

 Canadian  visitors  40 or 50 years later attested  to the

 SAD FACT THAT our MANNERS HADN't IMPROVED ALL THAT MUCH

 WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, >. ,  '

 O ne who is reported  to have made the mistake  of calling 

 his Sydney audience  B r it is h got a terrible  roasting  from 

 his proudly  Australian  listeners ,

 Perhaps. it was because  he was touring  for the Imperial  

 Federation  League, which wasn' t all that popular  here or 

 in Australia ,

 O ur relationship  since those early days has continued  to

 BE CLOSE, THOUGH MUCH WARMER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE.

 We co- operate  closely  over a wide range of issues an6 in

 SUCH FORUMS as THE UNITED NATIONS AND SUCH UN BODIES AS

 the C onference  on Disarmament  and the High C ommission  for 

 Refugees ; and, of course , the GATT', ''

 W e are active together  in the C ommonwealth  (on Southern  

 Africa issues, for example ) and the 14-member  C airns G roup 

 of fair trading  nations ,

 Across this broad range, our a c t iv it ie s  are usually  closely

 CO-ORDINATED AND MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE.

 A CENTRAL AND WELL'ENTRENCHED FACTOR IN THIS RELATIONSHIP 

 IS CO-OPERATION IN TRADE MATTERS,

 ' > .  \

 There has been substantial  growth  in this relationship

 OVER THE LAST three YEARS. ' '

 A QUICK REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA'S EXPORT FIGURES CONFIRMS THE 

 IMPORTANCE OF THE CANADIAN MARKET TO US,

 O ur exports  have increased  at an annual rate of more than 

 30 PERCENT A YEAR OVER THIS PERIOD.

 At the moment , they are running  at around  600 m illio n C anadian

 DOLLARS,

 C anada has risen in the last three years from our 21st 

 to our 15th largest  export  market,

 Tr a d it io n a l commodity exports s t il l dominate our trade,

 C anada is one of Australia ' s best customers - for sugar and

 A MAJOR MARKET FOR OUR ALUMINA, WINE, CANNED AND DRIED 

 FRUIT, BEEF, LAMB AND CONFECTIONERY.

 All our major export  categories  have grown  strongly , in

 FACT, .

 These include  the so- called elaborately  transformed  manufactures :

 ELECTRICAL MACHINERY, TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT, IRON AND STEEL 

 AND SCIENTIFIC AND AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT,

 We ARE ALSO SELLING COMPUTERS.AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE,

 Canadian  exports  have also been growing  very strongly  in 

 the Australian  market  over the last three years,

 I n 1987, they increased  more than 10 percent  to more than 

 750 m illio n C anadian  dollars ,

 Australia  is C anada' s 13th largest  market  in total, but 

 â¢its fourth  largest  market  for manufactured  products ,

 O ver recent  years, growth  in traditional  C anadian  exports  

 to Australia  such as chemicals , wood, pulp and paper has 

 been complemented  by a range' of manufactured  exports ,

 These include  agricultural  equipment , office machinery , 

 computers , telecommunications  hardware  and a wide range 

 of consumer  goods,

 Ac t iv it y has noticeably  grown  in such services  as tourism

 AND BANKING AND IN INVESTMENT,

 > . , . . 

 I nvestment  is an area in which a most sig nificant  change

 HAS TAKEN- PLACE IN OUR C.OMMERC IAL RELATIONSHIP OVER THE 

 LAST THREE YEARS, â 

 I KNOW YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT THERE IS NOW A DEFINITE

 Australian  presence  in C anadian  business ; BKP, for example ; 

 the Î‘ÎÎ B ank; E lders; Thomas N ationwide  Transport ; and 

 W estern M ining C orporation .

 This maturing  in the commercial  relationship  w ill, I trust, 

 heighten  C anada' s profile as a commercial  partner .

 The co- operation  agreement  signed during April ...between  

 the C anadian  M anufacturers ' Association  and the Australian  

 Chamber  of M anufactures  is a major step along the way: -  

 opening  up opportunities  for commerce  and investment ; offering

 EACH SIDE INFORMATION on TRADE WITH THE OTHER; CREATING 

 A WAY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS OF INTEREST TO INDUSTRIES SERVICED  

 BY BOTH ORGANISATIONS,

 A TWO-YEAR PROGRAM IS UP AND RUNNING FOLLOWING THE AGREEMENT,  WITH SEVERAL IN IT IA T IV E S  ALREADY UNDER WAY,

 The C anada/Australia  Trade Agreement  signed in 1960 is

 just the latest edition of special bilateral  trading  arrangements

 which have existed between  us for decades ,

 These arrangements  have underpinned  our trading.relationship ,

 They have been effective  in promoting  the interests  of

 BOTH OUR COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY BY PROVIDING PREFERENTIAL 

 RATES OF DUTY ON A LARGE NUMBER OF ITEMS.

 > . i '

 The 1960 A greement  was freely entered  into by both G overnments .

 It survives  so healthily  because  it is assessed  by both 

 of us as representing  in its totality  a balance  of advantage

 FOR BOTH SIDES, .

 CANATA ( as we call i t ) certainly  appears  to have CONFIRMED

 THE ASSESSMENT.

 The preferences  provided  under CANATA are important  to

 A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES. '  '

 Special additional  preferential  arrangements  are guaranteed

 FOR a LIMITED NUMBER OF GOODS. "

 I t IS NOT JUST THE traditional  direct connection  which 

 FUELS OUR RELATIONSHIP.

 Both C anada, and Australia  have a great deal to contribute  

 AS well as a great deal to gain from the shift by the centre

 OF GRAVITY IN THE WORLD ECONOMY FROM THE OLD WORLD TO THE

 As ia-Pa c if ic region.

 Both of us are well placed  geographically  and industrially

 TO TAKE PART IN WHAT IS NO LESS THAN AN ECONOMIC EXPLOSION, >. *· '

 The region has the three countries  with the highest  GDP

 IN THE WORLD.

 It contains  the so- called Four Tigers - H ong Kong, S outh 

 Korea, Singapore  and Taiwan - which have been labelled  . 

 miracle  economies .

 I t contains  also the Association  of S outh East Asian N ations

 WHICH HAS DEVELOPED INTO A FORMIDABLE ORGANISATION ON POLITICAL 

 AND ECONOMIC GROUNDS.

 The pace of growth  in the region has been almost  phenomenal !

 EIGHT PERCENT OF WORLD PRODUCTION IN THE EARLY 1960s AND 

 MORE THAN DOUBLE THIS BY'THE EARLY 'l980s.

 By the end of the 1990s, i t  i s e s t im a t e d  t h a t  the r e g io n

 WILL ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 25 PERCENT OF. WORLD.PRODUCTION 

 AND ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF WORLD TRADE.

 About two t h ir d s  of Au s t r a l i a ' s trade  i s  al r e a d y  w it h  c o u n t r ie s  

 IN THE REGION. - .

 Canada  a l s o  has been pa r t of. the in c r e a s in g  in t e r d e p e n d e n c e  

 of As i a -Pa c i f i c  r e g io n a l  e c o n o m ie s .

 FOR SOME U . S ,  PRODUCTS. .  1 1 . ·

 Au s t r a l i a n s  are encouraged t h a t the Pr im e Mi n i s t e r ,  Mr 

 MULRONEY, HAS AFFIRMED THAT (WITH THE FTA COMING INTO FORCE)

 Canada  w i l l  honor a l l  i t s  e x i s t i n g  i n t e r n a t io n a l  o b l i g a t i o n s .

 We HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT THIS INCLUDES COMMITMENTS UNDER

 CANATA,

 O n  the broad  f r o n t , we t r u s t  t h a t  -  w it h  the FTA n e g o t ia t io n s

 BEHIND THEM -  CANADA AND THE U . S .  WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE 

 FULLY IN THE MULTILATERAL EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO LIBERALISE 

 WORLD TRADE.

 WE TRUST THAT BOTH COUNTRIES WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE PART 

 IN THE CRUCIAL WORK GOING ON TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE 

 RULES AND OPERATION OF THE GATT SYSTEM.

 W e note and welcome  the commitments  by M r M ulroney  and

 HIS COLLEAGUES THAT THE FTA WILL BE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH 

 THE GATT,

 WE, LIKE OTHER GATT MEMBERS, WILL BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT 

 THE FINAL LEGISLATION HERE AND IN WASHINGTON TO ENSURE 

 THAT COMMITMENTS TO THE GATT AND OTHER EXISTING INTERNATIONAL 

 OBLIGATIONS ARE MET,

 Canada and Australia  have worked  closely  together  since

 1986 TO ENSURE REFORM OF THE WORLD TRADE SYSTEM IN AGRICULTURE

 during the U ruguay  R ound of M ultilateral  Trade N egotiations .

 As MEMBERS OF THE CAIRNS GROUP, WE HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL  IMPACT ON THE DYNAMICS OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS,

 You w ill be aware that the C airns group has developed  into 

 a third force in agricultural  trade.

 It IS taking a place at the negotiating  table challenging  

 in influence  that traditionally  reserved  for the U . S ,  AND  

 the European  C ommunity .

 The C airns G roup transcends  the normal  international  grouping  

 in that it brings together  developing  and developed  countries  

 with a single purpose  to achieve  substantial  and genuine  

 multilateral  liber alisatio n  of trade in agriculture .

 The severely  depressed  condition  of agricultural  markets

 of the 1980 s has encouraged  a s ig nificant  increase  in international

 awareness  of the problems  of world agricultural  trade,

 Au s t r a l i a  and Can ad a have t a k e n th e o p p o r t u n it y  p r o v id e d 

 by ec o n o m ic s u m m it s and a t i n t e r n a t i o n a l  f o r u m s. such as 

 th e OECD AND ESCAP TO keep the is s u e  a t the forefront  of 

 d i s c u s s i o n s , .

 Th i s  has c o n t r ib u t e d  to the world c o m m u n it y ' s growing  r e c o g n it io n  

 of the c a u s e s , the e f f e c t s  and the e x t e n t  of the c r i s i s  

 IN a g r ic u l t u r a l  trade  and the need for r e fo rm .

 The success  of the Uruguay  Round n e g o t ia t io n s  w il l  be in f l u e n c e d  

 g rea tly  by the outcome  of the Mi d -T erm r e v ie w  in Mo ntreal  

 in  De c e m b e r , .

 Th i s  was r e c o g n is e d  at the OECD Mi n i s t e r i a l  Co u n c il  m e e t in g  

 in Pa r i s  in May and at the economic  s u m m it  here in Ju n e ,

 It is Au s t r a l i a ' s v ie w  —  sh ar ed , l b e l i e v e , by Canada  

 —  th a t  success  at Mo n tr eal  w i l l  set the scene  p o s i t i v e l y .

 FOR THE REST OF THE URUGUAY ROUND, .

 We b e l i e v e  t h a t  i t  w i l l  g iv e  new c o n f id e n c e  and d ir e c t i o n

 TO THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM WHILE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE,

 The danger  must be f a c e d , however , th a t  the n e g o t ia t in g

 PROCESS COULD STALL IF THE EMPHASIS DURING THE LEAD-UP

 to Mo n tr eal  focusses  on the breadth  of the d if f e r e n c e s ,

 BETWEEN THOSE TAKING PART, ‘

 l GIVE AS AN EXAMPLE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U , S .  AND 

 THE E .C . ON AGRICULTURE. '

 Australia  would emphasise  the s im il a r it ie s  in the positions

 OF THOSE TAKING PART RATHER THAN THEIR DIFFERENCES.

 I n our view, this would be more likely to RESULT in SUCCESS  

 RATHER THAN WHAT W E CONSIDER THE MORE NEGATIVE APPROACH,

 The stakes are h ig h,

 The PERIODIC CRISES IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE HAVE BECOME PROGRESSIVELY  

 WORSE OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS AND ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY 

 THE HIGH SPENDING POLICIES AND RESTRICTIVE IMPORT REGIMES 

 OF A FEW MAJOR INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES. .

 E . C ,  MEMBERS, FOR EXAMPLE, POUR MORE THAN 100 BILLION U , S , DOLLARS (IN  ONE FORM OR ANOTHER) INTO FARM SUPPORT,

 As Mrs Thatcher  p o in t e d  out in Ottawa  l a s t  month , in Eur ope , -

 THE SUBSIDY PER COW IS GREATER THAN THE PERSONAL INCOME 

 OF HALF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. '

 â  JUSTIFIED AS A WAT TO FORCE THE E.C. TO COWIT ITSELF 

 TO COMPREHENSIVE REFORM.

 E DAMAGE CAUSED «V THIS EXTRAVAGANT USE OF SCARCE 

 |Y 6E INCALCULABLE ,H ANT PRECISE SENSE OUT IT IS PLAIN

 n n r s w ,

 The incomes  of Australian  gra. n farmers , for example , have

 BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED. â   ·

 between  1980-81 and 1986-87, grain prices fell by  40-50

 PERCENT.

 Over the same p e r i o d , the a v er ag e income of Au s t r a l i a n

 GRAIN PRODUCERS FELL BY 70 PERCENT,

 I n OTHER WORDS, OUR EXPORT PERFORMANCE HAS SUFFERED AND  

 REAL LIVING-STANDARDS HAVE FALLEN AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE  

 TRYING TO PUT INTO EFFECT LONG OVERDUE ECONOMIC STRUCTURAL  

 CHANGE,

 These are uncomfortable  enough  r e a l i t i e s  for Au s t r a l i a ,

 These are c o u n t r ie s  where l i v i n g  stand ar ds  cannot  be cut

 AND THE MODE OF REFORM WILL BE CRUCIAL TO THE WELFARE AND 

 PERHAPS EVEN THE SURVIVAL OF THE MULTILATERAL TRADE SYSTEM.

 The k e y to progress towards reform a t th e Mi d - T erm r e v ie w

 THE INDUSTRIAL MAJORS,

 SO THE PROCESS IS NOf WITHOUT DISCOMFORT,

 There i s no g a i n w it h o u t p a i n ,

 But I REPEAT my p o i n t abou t th e need for co- o p e r a t i v e  a c t i o n .

 I t does not m atte r how im p o r t a n t i t  MAY BE: no country

 CAN -  THROUGH ITS OWN ACTIONS -  DETERMINE A SOUND BASIS 

 FOR AGRICULTURAL TRADE,

 Th i s p u b l i c  good can o n ly be made e f f e c t i v e  and o p e r a t i o n a l

 THROUGH CONCERTED MULTILATERIAL ACTION,

 Th i s m e a n s, of c o u r s e, t h a t t h e U . S . ,  th e E ,C . an d Ja p a n

 ARE NOW REQUIRED TO RESPOND CO-OPERATIVELY TO THE INTERNATIONAL 

 NEED FOR AGRICULTURAL REFORM AS WELL AS TO THEIR OWN NATIONAL 

 INTERESTS IN REFORM.

 It also  means  th at  the Ca ir n s  Group, w it h  Canada  c o n t in u in g

 ITS INFLUENTIAL ROLE, HAS A MAJOR SHARE IN THE INTERNATIONAL 

 REFORM PROCESS,

 No t h in g  should  be allow ed  th at  would de tra ct  from the Ca ir n s  

 Gr o u p ' s c a p a c it y  to p lay  out t h i s  role and i t s  o p p o r t u n it y

 TO REAP THE REWARDS,

 At A MEETING OF THE AGRICULTURE NEGOTIATING GROUP LAST

 month  in  Ge n e v a , the Ca ir n s  Group put forward  a proposal

 WHICH CALLS FOR DECISIONS BY MINISTERS AT MONTREAL ON BOTH â   

 IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM REFORMS TOWARDS LIBERALISING THE 

 INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL TRADING SYSTEM,.

 Le t me p o i n t out the b a s i c  e l e m e n t s of the Gr o u p' s ap pr oa ch

 ON WHICH DECISIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED AT MONTREAL·

 They in c l u d e the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n  of long term reform o b j e c t i v e s

 , THE DESIGN OF, AND AGREEMENT ON, TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS 

 AND RULES; AND AN IMMEDIATE FREEZE ON TRADE DISRUPTING 

 SUPPORT MEASURES. .

 They in c l u d e a c o m m itm e n t to a " down p a y m e n t" on lo ng term

 REFORM WHICH INVOLVES REDUCING AGGREGATE SUPPORT LEVELS 

 IN EACH OF 1989 AND 1990, THROUGH ACTION ON MEASURES WHICH 

 ARE MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR TRADE DISRUPTION.

 Al l  THESE ELEMENTS WOULD BE PART OF A SINGLE, INTEGRATED  

 REFORM FRAMEWORK. ·

 Canada and Australia  will need to work closely  together

 TO OBTAIN SUPPORT FOR SUCH REFORM FROM.THE U . S . ,  THE E, C ,

 and Japan.

 You WILL ALL APPRECIATE THAT SUCCESS IN THIS VENTURE WILL 

 ENSURE, FOR BOTH CANADA AND AUSTRALIA, IMPROVED AND SUSTAINABLE 

 RESULTS WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL TRADING SYSTEM.

 W E HAVE BOTH BEEN TAKING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN CHALLENGING 

 THE EXPORT OF SUBSIDISED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.

 The primary  focus of our attention  is on the European  community  

 an0 The U nited States.

 But there are other countries  which produce  and export  

 such commodities  with the help of domestic  subsidy  programs ,

 These subsidies  distort  international  agricultural  markets .

 They have a sig nificant  impact on prices.

 They can have negative  long term consequences  for the very 

 domestic  industries  which they seek to a s s is t. v

 W e have some sympathy  with the motives  behind C anada' s 

 own agricultural  subsidy  program ,

 Bu t Au s t r a l i a  b e l i e v e s  t h a t -  i f th ere are to be t a n g i b l e ,

 LONG TERM BENEFITS FOR PRODUCERS -  ALL GOVERNMENTS, AT 

 ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, MUST BE PREPARED TO TAKE THE HARD 

 DECISIONS WHICH MAY HAVE SHORT TERM DISADVANTAGES FOR SECTORAL 

 INTERESTS BUT WHICH OVER TIME BRING THEM GREATER SECURITY 

 AND REWARDS.

 I t WAS THE PROSPECT OF THESE LONGER-TERM BENEFITS WHICH 

 PERSUADED AUSTRALIA TO ANNOUNCE REFORMS RECENTLY TO ACCELERATE 

 RESTRUCTURING MEASURES NOT ONLY IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR 

 BUT ALSO IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, COVERING DAIRY, SUGAR, 

 TOBACCO AND WHEAT. .

 The PRINCIPLES WHICH UNDERLIE THESE REFORMS ARE THE PRINCIPLES 

 WE ARE PROMOTING AS THE FOUNDATION FOR AGRICULTURAL NEGOTIATIONS

 i n the Uruguay r o u n d. ' ·

 They w i l l have to be sh ar ed an d p r a c t i s e d  by a l l members 

 of th e Ca i r n s Group i f our l e a d e r s h i p  ro le i s to r e m a in

 Au s t r a l i a  regards the Mi d - T erm Re v ie w as p r o v i d i n g  an i d e a l

 OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE EARLY AGREEMENTS IN A NUMBER OF 

 AREAS WHERE GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.

 Such progress would be f u l l y c o n s is t e n t  w i t h th e approach 

 AGREED AT THE GATT MINISTERIAL MEETING HELD IN 1 9 8 6  AT 

 PUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE URUGUAY ROUND AND 

 PROVIDED FOR EARLY AGREEMENTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED BEFORE 

 THE ROUND IS FORMALLY CONCLUDED.

 Pa r t i c i p a n t s  in  the Round w il l  n a t u r a l l y  have d i f f e r e n t

 PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT WILL CONSTITUTE SUCCESS IN MONTREAL.

 I t SEEMS CLEAR, THOUGH, THAT THE MEETING MUST GO BEYOND  

 MERE STOCKTAKING OF PROGRESS MADE SINCE THE ROUND BEGAN,

 There i s a need for t a n g i b l e  progress to be r e g i s t e r e d , 

 as OECD Mi n i s t e r s  and l e a d e r s  at the Toronto  Su m m it  r e c o g n is e d ·

 We should  not deny ourselves  the b e n e f it s  of e a r l y  agreem ents ,

 WHEREVER THEY ARE REASONABLY AVAILABLE.

 Au s t r a l i a  has p r e v io u s l y  i d e n t i f i e d  i t s  p a r t ic u l a r  in t e r e s t s

 IN THE SUBSTANCE AND THE PRIORITIES WHICH MIGHT FORM PART 

 OF THE PACkAGE OF EARLY RESULTS FOR THE MID'TeRM  REVIEW.

 Ag r ic u l t u r e  is one such i n t e r e s t , of c o u r s e .

 However , Au s t r a l i a ' s e x p e c t a t io n s  a t the Mi d - T erm Re v ie w

 ARE BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT ~ ALTHOUGH PROGRESS ON ISSUES 

 WILL VARY -  EARLY ( I F  LIM ITED) RESULTS IN SOME AREAS ARE 

 NECESSARY AND POSSIBLE.

 WE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTIES FACING THE NEGOTIATIONS, 

 ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURE.

 But WE MAINTAIN THAT THE NEED FOR EARLY PROGRESS IS OVERWHELMING.

 A s u c c e s s f u l Mi d - Term Re v ie w  i n v o l v i n g  th e sorts of e l e m e n t s

 l  HAVE JUST MENTIONED WOULD GIVE NEW CONFIDENCE AND DIRECTION 

 TO THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM,

 I t WOULD BOOST CONFIDENCE IN THE CAPACITY OF THE MEMBERS 

 OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE 

 WORLD TRADING ENVIRONMENT, .

 IT WOULD ACT TO CURB THE CURRENT DANGEROUS TREND TOWARDS 

 PROTECTIONISM AND BILATERALISM,

 IT WOULD HELP GOVERNMENTS TO RESIST PRESSURES FOR PROTECTIONIST 

 REACTIONS TO PROTECTIONIST ACTIONS OF OTHERS,

 A PERCEIVED FAILURE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS THE POTENTIAL 

 TO DERAIL THE ENTIRE URUGUAY ROUND,

 WE WOULD THEREFORE URGE ALL PARTICIPANTS -  INCLUDING CANADA 

 TO APPROACH THE MiD-TERM REVIEW IN THE SAME CONSTRUCTIVE 

 WAY IN WHICH THEY CO-OPERATED IN 1986 IN THE LAUNCH OF

 the Uruguay  Ro u n d ,

 W e would urge Canada  by i t s  a c t io n  and advocacy  to use 

 i t s  in f l u e n c e  on the major  t r a d in g  c o u n t r ie s  i n  p r o p o r tio n

 TO ITS INFLUENCE IN WORLD AFFAIRS TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL 

 OUTCOME FROM THE MiD-TERM REVIEW,

 Ce r t a i n l y , Au s t r a l i a  is c o m m itte d  to a c h i e v in g  t h i s  g o a l ,

 I TRUST THAT ! HAVE BEEN ABLE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH 

 SOME FURTHER INSIGHTS INTO ELEMENTS OF AUSTRALIA'S IMPORTANT 

 RELATIONS WITH CANADA,

 For ALL SORTS OF CULTURAL. AND HISTORICAL REASONS, AUSTRALIANS

 and Ca n a d i a n s  get along e a s i l y  as p e o p l e,

 They can be found w o r king to gether i n p u r s u i t o f common

 GOALS,

 As M r Mulro ney  has put i t : "Our common h e r it a g e , our m em o r ies   of j o i n t  a l l e g ia n c e  d u r in g  past  c o n f l ic t s , our economic

 TIES THAT BIND US", .

 Î¯ Ï  IS THESE LONG ESTABLISHED TIES WHICH DEMAND -  AND IN  MANY WAYS ENSURE -  THAT CANADA AND AUSTRALIA WORK TOGETHER 

 TO PROMOTE THEIR COMMON INTEREST IN AN ORDERLY AND FAIR 

 WORLD ECONOMIC AND TRADING SYSTEM,
