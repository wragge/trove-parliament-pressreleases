 Press Release 

 MARISE PAYNE  Senator for  New South Wales 

 Funding boost for Parramatta Migrant  Resource Centre 

 27 May 2005 

 

 Liberal Senator for New South Wales, Senator Marise Payne, today  welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs, Hon Peter McGauran MP, of over $1 million in  funding for the Baulkham Hills Holroyd Parramatta Migrant Resource  Centre, based in Parramatta. 

 "Australia is internationally recognised as a world leader in refugee  settlement services with dedicated programs to aid new arrivals in  their new home," Senator Payne said. 

 "The Australian Government's settlement programs play a vital role  in providing refugees, humanitarian entrants and family migrants  with opportunities to realise their full potential - both for themselves  and for their families, and to fully participate in Australian society. 

 "This funding demonstrates the Government's commitment to  ensuring the delivery of quality services for our migrants, with  funding for the centre to be used in capacity building, service  planning and direct services for Palestinian, African, Afghani,  Bangladeshi, Burmese and Eritrean communities in Greater Western  Sydney," Senator Payne said. 

 The Australian Government will spend a record $30 million on  settlement programs to be delivered by 147 community based  organisations across Australia in 2005.
