 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH 

  

 Tony Abbott Doorstop Parliament  House   17/06/10  

 Subjects: The Rudd government’s failed cabinet processes; Kevin Rudd’s great big  new tax on mining; health.  

 E&OE 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, it’s pretty clear that this is a government in total institutional disarray. We have  today credible reports that Simon Crean is yet another senior Minister who was kept  in the dark about government decisions, which means that Peter Garrett isn’t  consulted about environmental decisions, Martin Ferguson isn’t consulted about 

 mining decisions, Simon Crean isn’t consulted about trade decisions. It’s no way to  run a country and one of the first acts of an incoming government ought to be to  restore proper cabinet processes. One of the reasons why we’ve had so many bad  decisions from this government is because the Prime Minister has chronically bad  judgement and the government as a whole has chronically bad process. 

 QUESTION: 

 How does that work when you don’t put things to your party room, like PPL for  example. 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 The question is how should a government operate and this government does not  operate in accordance with the standard Westminster principles and if it did operate in  accordance with standard Westminster principles there’s every reason to believe that  it wouldn’t have made as many bad decisions… 

 QUESTION: 

 And your operation? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 …but, I think it is part of the Prime Minister’s political character to want to centralise,  to want to dictate rather than consult, to want to lecture rather than listen and it’s  obvious that it’s now seeping out. His Ministers are confessing to the fact that they are  treated like mushrooms. 

 QUESTION: 

 Are you happy that the national funding authority for the health plan is being  scrapped? It’s one less layer of the bureaucracy. 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, the whole thing was a bureaucrats picnic from start to finish. I think what it  suggests is that Mr Rudd’s health reform wasn’t very much to start with and it’s even  less now. 

 QUESTION: 

 Will you be making any changes to your policy or approach to boat people after your  surf lesson with a refugee? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, I’m looking forward to the, getting out into the ocean. I was pleased that the  GetUp! organisation bid some $16,000 because obviously the money’s going to a  good cause and I’m looking forward to having a morning at sea. 

 QUESTION: 

 But, you’re not likely to change anything as a result of it? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, I’m always happy to have a conversation. I try to be open and collegial and I’m  looking forward to the day. It’s always good to get out into the ocean. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you think BHP, Xstrata and Rio’s statement yesterday about the mining tax  consultations show that those negotiations are indeed are sham? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 It’s a bad tax. There is no way to improve it. It should just be dumped. These are the  sorts of conversations that if the government had been fair dinkum, if it’d been any  sort of grown up government, would have been had before the decision was made, not 

 afterwards. The decision is a bad decision. There’s no way to fix it. The tax should  simply be dumped. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you think the government’s trying to convince the Australian public that they’re  making head way by continually talking about how well the negotiations are going? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 I think basically the government is wasting people’s time and I think that’s the  problem. I think often this is a government which takes people for mugs and plainly  what the miners want is an end to retrospectivity, a change to the threshold, a change  to the rate and acknowledgement that different types of minerals have different 

 profitability and they’re precisely the four things that the government won’t talk  about. 

 QUESTION: 

 But, are you taking people for mugs by saying that the mining industry shouldn’t pay  any more tax at all when in fact they themselves admit that there needs to be some  sort of change in the system? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, what we’ve been… 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you concede that there needs to be any change at all? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 The last thing we should be doing is killing the goose that’s laid the golden egg for  Australia and any change which gouges more money from future projects, which  gouges more money for projects where the sums have already been done is a change 

 which is a dagger aimed at the heart of our prosperity and that’s not good for anyone. 

 QUESTION: 

 [inaudible] stray from that line for a second to actually answer the question. 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 The fact is that this is a very bad tax. It’s a very bad tax because it is going to  dramatically increase the comparative tax rate on Australian mining. It will damage  our international competitiveness and given that investment is mobile, even if  minerals in the ground aren’t, that’s going to mean that the investment goes overseas  and we lose jobs. Our future is prejudiced. 

 QUESTION: 

 On your logic though are you saying that there can never be any type of change or  reform for future projects? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 At the moment we have a very good situation. If the mining industry expands the  states get more money through royalties. If the mining industry is more profitable the  Commonwealth gets more money through increased company tax payments. That’s 

 the way it should be. This idea that any rate of return over and above what you can get  putting your money in the bank is a super profit that should attract a super tax is  crackers and this idea that as soon as industries do well you hit them with penalties,  that’s penalising success and that’s crackers too.
