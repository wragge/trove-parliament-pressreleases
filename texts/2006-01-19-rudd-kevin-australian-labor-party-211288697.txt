 KEVIN RUDD M.P.   

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and  International Security  DOORSTOP - Radisson Plaza, Sydney   

 19 January 2006   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:  Australian Wheat Board; East Timor; Robert Hill.   

 

 RUDD:    Well each day this scandal gets worst and worse. This is the  biggest corruption scandal in Australia’s history. It is also one of the biggest  corruption scandals that we have ever seen around the world. We have this  morning extraordinary developments in relation to what happened with the so-called Tigris matter, what has happened with the so-called repayment of  amounts of money from the problems arising from the alleged contamination of  a shipment of Australian wheat.  

 

 What all of this boils down to is this: on both of these matters, the Tigris matter  and the wheat contamination matter, we have now evidence that the AWB was  using grossly improper means to obtain funds unlawfully from the United 

 Nations bank account.    

 What we now have is evidence that in fact funds were being ripped off from the  United Nations bank account by the AWB and there is a big challenge here now  for Foreign Minister Downer, which is this: if the AWB has ripped off more than  $10 million dollars from the United Nations bank account, what action now will  Foreign Minister Downer take to ensure that these monies are repaid.   

 Australia has international obligations here at stake. If we have the AWB ripping  money off from a UN bank account, then we have an obligation as a country to  ensure that these things are made right.   

 My challenge to Mr Downer here today, who still is buried in some bunker in the  Adelaide hills, is to come out and tell Australians how this is to be put right.    

 The second thing that I have to say is this: when it comes to the Tigris matter,  which involves some $7.8 million dollars US and a little more as well, this is a  scandal which arose after John Howard took Australia to war in Iraq. Let’s  remember that the invasion of Iraq occurred in March 2003. That is when  Australia participated in what the Government described as the liberation of  Iraq. Well, straight after the liberation of Iraq by John Howard, what we have is  the AWB ripping off some $10 million dollars plus from the United Nations. I  find this disgraceful, disgusting and unacceptable. 

 

 The other point I note as far as the chronology of all this is concerned is that just  after the Iraq war, the Howard Government, the Prime Minister and the Foreign  Minister, appointed the former Chairman of the AWB to become a special  adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture, this is in early 2003. It is at that time  also that we have this Tigris affair unfolding in a very big way, the Tigris affair  which results in some $7.8 million dollars US being ripped off from the United  Nations bank account which is unacceptable and unacceptable in the extreme.  

 

 Finally, I would say this. As far as other evidence which was presented today, we  also have accounts of a meeting in November 2002 between the AWB and the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade over how an amount of some $2  million dollars was to be paid. That is, an amount which arose from the so-called  problem of contaminated Australian wheat. Now we don’t yet know precisely  what happened in those consultations between the AWB and the Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade. My challenge again to Mr Downer is to tell us all  what did happen at that time. What advice did DFAT provide to the AWB? Did 

 DFAT follow up with the AWB in terms of what the AWB consequently did?  Because what we know after the event is that the AWB, once again, did  absolutely the wrong thing by Australia’s interests and the interest of Australian  wheat farmers.   

 REPORTER:  Given the evidence that we have heard from Mr Lindberg  over the past couple of days, do you think he should stand down?   

 RUDD:   I think that it is critical that Mr Lindberg now take the course  of action which is in the best interests of Australian wheat farmers. And I would  have thought by now and I would have hoped by now that he would know what  that course of action was.   

 REPORTER:  So is that to stand down, in your mind?   

 RUDD:   I stand by what I just said.  

 

 REPORTER:  Some commentators in the media have said that the  Government should make him repay the money that the buck stops with the guy  in charge of this.   

 RUDD:   I believe that it is imperative for Mr Lindberg to take the  action which is in the best interests of Australian wheat farmers. Given  everything that we have heard to date and in the absence of evidence to the  contrary, I would think that Mr Lindberg has no other course of action available.   

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:   I don’t propose to make any further commentary on Mr  Lindberg himself. What I would say is this: when it comes to the consequences of  the actions taken by the AWB, when the AWB rips off a whole bucket of money  from the United Nations, Mr Downer our Foreign Minister has a responsibility  on behalf of Australia as to how we are going to set that to right. How is that  going to be properly accounted for, how is it going to be properly settled?   

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:   I would call upon Mr Downer to make a clear-cut statement  as to how the government proposes to do that. I am not in full possession of all of  the information, which I assume Mr Downer is, in terms of the precise details of  the financial arrangements at this time.    

 But can I just say this. Australia’s international reputation is at stake. I am calling  upon Mr Downer to take the appropriate action to ensure that this money which  has been ripped off from the United Nations is properly accounted for and this  matter is settled. 

 

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:   On the details of this particular case, I haven’t yet been fully  briefed. And my colleague, the Shadow Minister for Immigration Tony Burke, I  am sure will make further comment on this later on.   

 I would say in general terms this: that when it comes to any people seeking  protection in Australia, we should accord to them the full rights and protections  which are available under Australian law and their cases should be properly  processed consistent with those laws.    

 REPORTER:  Should those claims be processed on the Australian  mainland? 

 

 RUDD:  Again, I would like to say that I am not fully briefed on the  details of the case. You would appreciate that I have been principally engaged  with the AWB matter. What I would say as a matter of principle is that if  someone is seeking protection and or asylum, that these cases should be dealt  with appropriately, consistent with Australian law and through the normal  regulatory processes available under Australian laws. That is what should  happen now.   

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:  There may be, there may not be. I have not been in contact  with the Indonesian Embassy on this matter yet. My starting point is this: that  when it comes to the proper protections of any individual from any part of the  world who are seeking protection here in Australia, they should be provided  with proper access to the protections which are available under Australian  immigration and asylum law. This is an important principle and they should be  treated consistent with other people.   

 REPORTER:  Should they be processed at an external location such as  Manus Island, a la the ‘Pacific Solution’?   

 RUDD:  I think that it is appropriate that they are dealt with  compassionately, humanely and in a manner consistent with Australian law. Let  me just put this in terms of general principle. When it comes to protecting  anyone’s life who comes to this country fearing for their lives abroad, our first  responsibility is to ensure that our obligations under the UN Convention for the  Protection of Refugees is adhered to. That is my fundamental concern, it is a 

 fundamental human right and it extends to everybody, including these folk as  well. Beyond that, in terms of the details of the case, I would rather not comment  further.  

 

 REPORTER:  What about major boat loads of asylum seekers, does that  present any problems?   

 RUDD:  Again I am not briefed on the details of the case. You would  appreciate that I have been principally engaged with the AWB. My colleagues  the Shadow Minister for Homeland Security and the Shadow Minister for  Immigration I am sure would be better placed to comment on that.   

 All that I would like to say is that when it comes to fundamental questions of  human rights, this country has obligations under international law, laid out in 

 the Refugees Convention, our job is to adhere to our undertakings under this  Convention and that applies to these people as well.    

 REPORTER:  In terms of our humanitarian policy what about the claims  that have been made against the Indonesians about widespread atrocities? Do  you think that the government should protest to the Indonesian Government? 

 

 RUDD:   I have noted the report today by the Commission on  Reconciliation in East Timor on the period 1975 through until 1999. This report is  deeply and profoundly disturbing in terms of what happened in that sad and  sorry stage in East Timor’s history.   

 When it comes to what should now happen, my understanding is that the report  in question will now be presented by President Gusmao of East Timor to the  United Nations Secretary-General. 

 

 I would urge the United Nations to properly scrutinise the contents of the  recommendations of this report and that any action flowing from it should then  be undertaken. 

 

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:  There is a proper process to be adhered to here. The report  has been prepared for the United Nations. It is being taken to the UN in New  York by President Gusmao, that is my understanding and he will present it to  UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It will then be deliberated on by the United  Nations and its contents and recommendations subject to examination and then  appropriate action taken.   

 Can I just say let’s just call a spade a spade. This is an unfortunate, ugly,  appalling period in East Timor’s history. That is just what it was. It was a terrible  period for the degradation of the human rights in East Timor. That is a matter of  fact.   

 In terms of how we move forward, that is something which is the responsibility  of the United Nations, the Government of East Timor, the Government of  Indonesia as well as ourselves as more than an interested party.  

 

 I conclude by this: President Gusmao has also been very keen to emphasise the  importance of reconciliation and not basing future actions simply on retribution.  I think that shows great statesmanship. But that doesn’t mean that at the same  time that the rest of the world should simply sweep the events of 1975-1999  under the carpet. That shouldn’t occur. 

 

 REPORTER:  Should Australia be looking at paying reparations to East  Timor?   

 RUDD:  What we need to do is to look at this matter step by step. The  report has been prepared. I haven’t had the opportunity to read the report, it is  2,500 pages. The next proper stage of this process is for it to be presented to the  UN Secretary-General and for the UN itself to scrutinise it. Once that has  occurred, then let’s look at how its content and recommendations should be  considered and acted upon by other members of the international community. I  think that this has to be taken step by step.    

 REPORTER:  Should we be asking the UN to make a statement on our  behalf about what our obligation is?   

 RUDD:  No. We have sovereign responsibilities when it comes to  that. We are talking about a report which is 2,500 pages long which I certainly  haven’t read and I don’t think you have read it either.   

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:  Well, I saw Mr Downer’s letter in today’s Australian  newspaper. Can I just say that the letter itself was somewhat hysterical. The  reason that I say that is because at the end of it, Mr Downer said that we should  all await the Cole Commission of Inquiry’s conclusions and recommendations.  

 

 Well therein lies the problem.   

 Mr Cole doesn’t have powers in his terms of reference to make any  recommendations or conclusions in relation to Ministers of the Howard  Government, advisers to the Howard Government, or officials of the Howard  Government. Alexander Downer knows that. What he is in fact saying in today’s  letter is, everyone can basically back off and allow the Cole Commission of  Inquiry to report as it only has powers to make recommendations in its report on  the Wheat Board itself, not the government.    

 I say now for the fourth day running that the Howard Government, the Prime  Minister, should have the integrity now in the weight of evidence which is being  presented before this Inquiry, to expand the terms of reference so that the  Australian people can make a proper judgement about whether the Howard  Government has exercised its responsibilities properly to ensure that our  obligations under international law are adhered to, namely to prevent the 

 breaching of sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s regime which occurred to the  tune of $300 million dollars.    

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:  I believe John Howard wrote the terms of reference in a  manner to protect his government. John Howard is the master at political self-preservation. Remember that this is John Howard of Children Overboard fame.  John Howard believes that he can get away with it again. Our job as the  responsible opposition in this country is to ensure that all matters which are  relevant to this unfortunate scandal are put out into the public domain. Not just  those relating to the Wheat Board itself, but the actions, responsibility,  culpability of the Howard Government itself.   

 REPORTER:  Inaudible   

 RUDD:  Well, I think that today’s challenge for Mr Downer is to stop  playing Where’s Wally, because the bottom line is that the game of Where’s  Wally/ Where’s Alexander is getting a bit tiresome. I mean you can be buried  down in the bunkers of Adelaide Hills just for so long.   

 This scandal goes to the heart of Mr Downer’s portfolio. And if he has any sense  of responsibility he should be out in the public domain making plain what the  Department’s record has been through this entire saga.    

 As for him, Alexander Downer moving on to Defence, I mean good grief, give us  a break. God help the Australian armed forces.   

 By the way can I just add this: if the Howard Government proceeds to appoint  Robert Hill to the position of Australia’s Permanent Representative in New York,  this would represent the comprehensive prostitution of Australia’s diplomatic  service. John Howard needs to learn that the Australian Diplomatic is not a  Liberal Party employment agency. It is supposed to be a professional operation.  And if this action is taken to appoint Robert Hill to New York, it will make a  laughing stock of the way in which diplomatic appointments have been made. 

 Ends 19 January 2006.
