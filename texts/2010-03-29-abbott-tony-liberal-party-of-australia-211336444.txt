 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 29 March 2010 

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,   SYDNEY  

 

 Subjects: Kevin Rudd’s failed border protection policies; health; the Government’s reckless spending.   

 E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Today, the one hundredth boat has arrived at Christmas Island since the Rudd Government abandoned the  Howard Government’s border protection policies. This is a one hundred-fold indictment of the Rudd  Government’s policies. When Julia Gillard was the Shadow Minister for Immigration, she would regularly  put out press releases headed ‘another boat, another policy failure’. Well, this is a policy failure  compounded one hundred times.    

 The Government, plainly, is at sixes and sevens over this. We’ve had 89 asylum seekers transferred from  Christmas Island to Villawood, allegedly for security reasons, and yet some of them apparently are escaping  from Villawood and yet we have the Deputy Prime Minister denying that any such transfer would be  contemplated.    

 So, this really is a Government which has completely lost control of Australia’s borders. This is a  Government comprised of border protection deniers and, plainly, it’s a Government which is now  establishing not only a pattern of incompetence in a whole range of programme delivery areas but a pattern  of denial when things go wrong. It’s no wonder that the Government is looking ragged because they are  plainly losing control of our borders, they are plainly losing control of programme delivery.    

 QUESTION:   

 With these two boats that have arrived this afternoon, do you have concerns about where the people on  board are going to be housed?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Indeed, because the transfer of some hundreds of people off Christmas Island doesn’t mean that it has any  spare capacity. There’s about 2,000 people in Christmas Island in detention and that’s plainly bursting at the  seams.    

 QUESTION:   

  2 

 Do you think it’s acceptable to blame the private contractor running Villawood for those escapes and not  take any responsibility themselves?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think it’s typical of this Government - it’s always someone else’s fault. Now, it’s the Government’s policy  which has caused these problems, it’s the Government’s policy which is in place. These are centres which  are being run for the Australian Government and the Government has to take responsibility.    

 QUESTION:   

 The Department of Immigration is considering fining Serko, the company running the detention centres. Do  you back that decision?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think that this is something for which the Government needs to take responsibility. I think it’s all too  easy for people in power to blame others for their own faults and I don’t think the Australian public like it  when they see it.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, Mal Washer’s suggested that you take up the Prime Minister’s offer of a briefing on the health  reforms.   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well the first briefing that I got when I became the Leader of the Opposition was on health reform from  Christine Bennett, the Chairman of the Government’s Health Reform Commission. It’s typical of the  Government that they should be conducting megaphone diplomacy, as it were, with me just as they’ve  conducted megaphone diplomacy with so many others including the Indonesians. I’m certainly only too  happy to be constructive here but the fact is the Government doesn’t have a plan. How do I know if it’s a  good plan or not when so much of the plan is shrouded in secrecy and when the Government wasn’t even  prepared to take the state premiers into its confidence? I notice Premier Brumby said just a day or so back  that there were forty major questions that remain unanswered about the Government’s proposals.    

 QUESTION:   

 Kevin Rudd says his national health plan is key to Australia’s prosperity. Do you agree with that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that the key to Australia’s prosperity is maintaining a fundamentally sound economic structure and  we’ve got the Government’s workplace changes which are already causing tremors of doubt with some of  our major overseas buyers. Now, obviously it’s important that we get our health system operating as well as  possible but I think the Prime Minister is drawing a very long bow to say what he apparently has.    

 QUESTION:   

 When are we going to see your policy then?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

  3 

 You’ll see our policies in good time before the next election. If the Prime Minister was serious about  ensuring efficiency and choice in our health system he would not be undermining the private sector by  breaking an election promise and means testing the private health insurance rebate.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, Mal Washer’s suggestion that you support Rudd’s plan in an effort of bipartisanship - what’s  your response to that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I’m very happy to be constructive over a good plan but we don’t have any details to this plan. The  states can’t get details as to exactly what the new funding arrangements are going to be. The Prime Minister  is making it up as he goes when it comes to the funding of small country hospitals. It is not a plan. It is a  press release not a plan. Now, if it was a good plan I’d be happy to be constructive, but it isn’t even a plan,  it’s a press release.   

 QUESTION:   

 But if he’s offering to lay it out to you, would you take that offer?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I’m always happy to talk where I think there is genuine good faith on the part of the Government but  this is a Government which is far more interested in scoring cheap political points than it is in being  genuinely constructive. Let’s face it, he was not even prepared to take the state Labor premiers into his  confidence, so it’s hardly likely that he’s going to take me into his confidence. This is a Prime Minister who  wants to look like he’s consulting while he is in fact dictating.   

 QUESTION:   

 Glenn Stevens has been on Sunrise this morning explaining why the Reserve Bank’s pushing rates up higher  and he’s warning people against borrowing too much. Do you agree with Mr Stevens that people are taking  on too much debt?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that there is a fundamental conflict between what the Reserve Bank is doing and what the  Government is doing. The Government is spending like a drunken sailor and the Reserve Bank is trying to  prevent excessive spending. The Government is continuing with what is now an unnecessary stimulus while  the Reserve Bank is putting up interest rates. The Government has its foot on the accelerator, the Reserve  Bank has its foot on the brakes. No wonder people are confused about what this Government is actually  trying to do.      

 QUESTION:   

 Have you jumped on the scales and if you have how much have you lost?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I haven’t jumped on the scales but I’m certainly not going to be watching my diet for the next few  days and I’ve already been to Maccas at least once today.
