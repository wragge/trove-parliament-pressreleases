 Andrews gutless to pretend African decision not political 

 4th Oct 07 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today has accused the Minister for  Immigration Kevin Andrews of being 'gutless' for not taking  responsibility for his decision to ban African refugees from  coming to Australia.   

 "The Minister today has tried to claim his decision to ban African  refugees was a non-political decision taken in light of  departmental advice. That's gutless. He should take  responsibility for this political decision and suffer the  consequences," Senator Nettle said.   

 "When I asked the Secretary of the Department of Immigration  Mr Metcalfe during Senate Estimates hearings earlier this year  about the decision making process on refugee intake he said:   

 "Minsters make decisions on a whole set of issues that might go  with them into the cabinet room, and it is not appropriate for me  to speculate about what might be in a minister's mind or the 

 cabinet's mind when they make a decision."   

 "The Minister has introduced the non-humanitarian consideration  of 'integration' to the humanitarian refugee intake process. He  cannot shirk responsibility for this by claiming it is based on  advice from an 'interdepartmental committee'.   

 "The Greens do not support the use of 'integration' concerns as a  reason to adjust immigration quotas. The Labor party should  make the same unequivocal statement, but as yet have not.   

 "The Minister and his media people are guilty of beating up this  anti-African story and as a result Australian-Africans are  experiencing vilification.    

 "The Greens again call on the Minister to apologise to the 

 Australian African community and overturn his decision to ban  African humanitarian refugees from Australia."
