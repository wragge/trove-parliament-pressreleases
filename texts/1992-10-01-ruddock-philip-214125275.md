 HAWKE AND THE CHINESE STUDENTS

 Bob Hawke should not try to perpetuate the enormous and on-going  problems he created with his emotive decision on the Chinese Nationals by  attacking the Parliamentary Report which criticised that decision.

 Chinese nationals who were in Australia before the Tienanmen Square  massacre were given blanket protection for four years and re-assured that  they would not be forced back to China against their will at the end of that  time. This decision led to a total breakdown of the refugee determination  process as up to 17,000 Chinese Nationals who arrived after the Tienanmen  Square Massacre made claims for similar protection with the expectation  that they would receive it.

 This resulted in an enormous re-allocation of resources within the  Department of Immigration to deal with these claims which still have not  been adequately addressed, as well as severely hampering Australia's ability  to assist genuine refugees.

 Four Opposition and three Government members of the Joint Standing  Committee on Migration Regulations acknowledged that the decision was  flawed and recommended that a consistent and principled approach to the  problem be adopted.

 Regrettably, the present Prime Minister has re-affirmed this decision to  create an underclass of people with limited rights, as a permanent part of  Australian society. As permanent temporary residents, they will have no 

 rights to citizenship and the privileges that entails. As non-citizens or  permanent residents, they will have little incentive to make an overriding  and unifying commitment to Australia and be denied the opportunity to  successfully integrate over time into Australian society.

 Any new government in 1994 is going to have to address this matter  decisively. The approach to the problem should be non-discriminatory and  consistent, as the majority of the Committee has recommended. The same  principles and criteria ought to be applied, on a case-by-case basis, to the 

 Chinese nationals in the same way they are applied to every other person  seeking residency or asylum in this country.

 In my discussions with Chinese students, it has been acknowledged that  while some may have proper claims to protection because they have a well-  founded fear of persecution, a large number could not substantiate such 

 claims.

 The provision of on-going sanctuary to groups of people with no proven  claims undermines the capacity of a humane nation like Australia to assist  those in genuine need.

 Prime Minister Keating made a major error in affirming Bob Hawke's  decision in his ill-timed letter to the Chinese New Migrant Magazine.

 Now is the time for the Government to put it right and respond positively  to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration  Regulations which calls for a return to a bi-partisan approach and the re­ establishment of the long-standing non-discriminatory principles of 

 immigration.
