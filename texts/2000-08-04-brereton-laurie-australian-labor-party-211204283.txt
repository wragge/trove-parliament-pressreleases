 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today welcomed the adoption by the ALP National Conference of a resolution reaffirming Labor's support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.

 "The Resolution adopted unanimously by our National Conference yesterday reaffirms Labor's longstanding commitment to the Republic of Cyprus and our determination to do all that we can to support efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to this tragic conflict", Mr Brereton said.

 "Labor welcomes the improvement in relations between Greece and Turkey and hopes that this will facilitate progress toward resolution of the Cyprus issue."

 "At the same time, we remain deeply concerned at the absence of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops on Cyprus. The presence of foreign troops fuels tensions both on the island and in the Eastern Mediterranean and complicates efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement."

 "Labor recognises that both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have legitimate concerns that will need to be addressed through comprehensive negotiations covering all relevant issues, including full consideration of all United Nations resolutions on Cyprus."

 "Labor calls on the Australian Government to use all its influence to help facilitate a just and lasting settlement, consistent with United Nations resolutions and one based upon the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus."

 "Labor in government will maintain the position of an Australian Special Envoy for Cyprus and will commit Australia's good offices in active support of international efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem. Labor is committed to strengthen Australia's diplomatic presence in Nicosia which the Howard Government has reduced to an unacceptably low level."

 ALP National Conference - 3 August 2000

 Cyprus

 Labor deplores the fact that more than twenty-six years after the 1974 Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus, Cyprus remains artificially and tragically divided, and recognises the humanitarian cost this continued division imposes on the communities of the island.

 Labor reaffirms its longstanding and unequivocal support for the sovereignty, independence

 and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.

 Labor expresses its strong belief that the status quo on Cyprus is unacceptable and our deep concern that negotiations are still yet to secure a just and lasting resolution of the Cyprus issue.

 Labor calls once more upon Turkey to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, and to refrain from any and all action prejudicial to this sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Labor reaffirms the policy of non-recognition of the secessionist Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

 Labor reiterates its strong concern at the absence of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops on the island. The presence of foreign troops on Cyprus fuels tensions both on the island and in the Eastern Mediterranean and complicates efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement.

 Labor welcomes the improvement in relations between Greece and Turkey and hopes that this will facilitate progress toward resolution of the Cyprus issue.

 Labor recognises that both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have legitimate concerns that will need to be addressed through comprehensive negotiations covering all relevant issues, including full consideration of all relevant United Nations resolutions.

 Labor:

 reaffirms its strong support for the role of the UN Secretary-General, commends his continuing efforts to facilitate negotiations to secure a solution to the Cyprus problem, and expresses its deep concern at the continuing deadlock in intercommunal talks;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 reaffirms its support for the approach adopted in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions that require Cyprus to be one state, with a single sovereignty, single international personality and single citizenship based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 welcomes the efforts of the UN and others concerned to promote the holding of bicommunal events so as to build cooperation, trust and mutual respect between the two communities;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 applauds the efforts of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, especially officers of the Australian Federal Police who continue to make a vital contribution to its operations;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 calls for the sharp reduction in the number of foreign troops on Cyprus leading to the withdrawal of all such forces from the island; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 urges all concerned to commit to reductions in defence spending and equipment acquisition, and to a staged process aimed at substantially reducing the level of troops and armaments on the island with a view to achieving the total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 calls upon the parties to work towards resolution of the Cyprus problem in a way which guarantees to all Cypriot people the three freedoms of movement, settlement and ownership; and ensures the right of all refugees to return in safety;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 calls upon all involved parties to undertake urgent and comprehensive investigations into the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 calls on the Australian Government to use all its influence to help facilitate a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem, consistent with United Nations resolutions and based upon the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus; and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 further calls on the Australian Government to encourage assist and support all efforts and contacts which promote reconciliation between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, including those in Australia.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Labor in government will maintain the position of an Australian Special Envoy for Cyprus and will commit Australia's good offices in active support of international efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem. Labor will strengthen Australia's diplomatic presence in Nicosia which has been reduced to an unacceptably low level.

 Labor views positively the prospects of Cyprus joining the European Community with major potential benefits for the economic development and security of the whole island and the opportunity to bring the communities in Cyprus closer together.

 Labor calls on the international community to reinvigorate efforts to advance negotiations to restore justice for Cyprus and to bring about a long-term resolution of the Cyprus issue.
