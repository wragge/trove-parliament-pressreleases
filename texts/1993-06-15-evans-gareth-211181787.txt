 AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR MOZAMBIQUE

 Australia is to provide an additional $1 million for relief and rehabilitation programs in Mozambique, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Cook, said today.

 This brings to $8.1 million Australian Government emergency assistance for displaced people in Mozambique and Mozambican refugees in 1992/93.

 "The signing of the General Peace Agreement in October has paved the way for a gradual return to normality in Mozambique after years of civil war and drought," Senator Cook said.

 "This cannot be achieved without continuing international assistance.

 "The Australian Government will continue to support the work of Australian non-government organsations and international agencies in providing emergency relief and development assistance to Mozambique;" Senator Cook said.

 The Government will provide $900 000 for the World Vision Australia Mozambique Repatriation Program. The progam includes seeds and tools to increase crop production and promote self-sufficiency among refugees, displaced people, and demobilised soldiers; health and nutrition supplies for

 feeding centres to reduce malnutrition; and health education.

 The Government will also provide just over $100 000 to Community Aid Abroad for the Chicomo Emergency and Development Programme which involves the provision of food, clothing, seeds and tools, and the repair of water tanks.
