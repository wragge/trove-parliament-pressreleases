 LIBERALS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOSE REFUGEE PROVISIONS

 The Australian Democrats' deputy leader and spokesperson on   Immigration, Senator Jean Jenkins, today reminded the Liberal Party   of its support in 1989 for the migration legislation which gives the   Government a free hand to create any category of visa it wishes,

 "Changes were sought by the Democrats to the Migration Amendment   Bill 1989 and the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 with a   view to removing arbitrary and inhumane elements which offend   against international codes of human rights," Senator Jenkins said.

 "If a Liberal spokesperson such as Fred Chaney can now express   concern about the arbitrary stance taken by the Government on the   status of Chinese students, perhaps he can explain why he led his   party in the Senate in voting in support of such legislation.

 "However, the Liberals' decision to back the disastrous 1989   immigration legislation is the very reason why Government policy and   administration of these issues is in a state of chaos.

 "The solution is to completely redraft the legislation as   recommended by the 1988 Fitzgerald report," Senator Jenkins said. ends COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY MICAH CONTACT; Jean Jenkins 09 321 2110 ah 09 447 5882
