 Asylum seeker debate, compromise with the  Coalition  Tuesday, 26 June 2012 

 Doorstoop, Parliament House, Canberra 

 Chris Bowen: Thank you, everybody. Thanks for coming. I wanted to provide some  comments on the current impasse in relation to the asylum seeker debate. Clearly,  the Australian people want to see this resolved. The Australian people have had  enough of the politicking and the positioning. I first said that last November. It's  truer today than it has been at any time since. I was particularly dismayed last night  to see on 7.30 Mr Morrison indicate that even if the governmentoffered all three so-called essential elements of their policy as part of an attempt to break the impasse,  that would be rejected. These are policies that Mr Abbott and Mr Morrison have  lectured for a long time as absolutely essential. 

 Now, this says to me one of two things: either the Liberal Party has finally accepted  the expert advice that these policies will not be effective and is therefore laying the  groundwork for their failure; or the Liberal Party has made a political calculation that  boat arrivals are in their ongoing political best interest. Either way, this position is  completely untenable. 

 I also just want to spend a couple of minutes responding to some of the things Mr  Abbott said this morning. I won't respond to all of them because I don't want to  detain you for too long. But I'll respond to a couple of the key points. Firstly, Mr  Abbott said the governmenthas not moved an inch, not moved an inch, in these  discussions. Let me remind him and let me remind you. Last year, the  governmentinitiated negotiations with the Opposition, out of the glare of day to day  politics. We did so confidentially. We wrote to Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister wrote to  Mr Abbott and invited him to begin negotiations. The Liberal Party rejected those  negotiations and demanded that we make a so-called 'offer'. 

 In response, the governmentsaid we would open a detention centre at Nauru - a  significant move by the government - and have an independent inquiry into  temporary protection visas with the terms of reference and an eminent Australian  mutually agreed in relation to that review. We indicated to the Opposition we would  discuss and agree the terms of reference with them and discuss and agree who  should conduct that inquiry. The Opposition, on the other hand, has not moved at  all, at all. 

 Secondly, Mr Abbott again claimed this morning that opening a detention centre on  Nauru would not require legislation. This flies in the face of all the legal advice. And  I have this question: if it doesn't require legislation, why did Mr Abbott promise this  legislation as a priority in his Budget reply speech? Why did he say one of the first  acts of a new Abbott governmentwould be this legislation if now he says it would  not be required? 

 The final point I want to make is this: the Liberal Party says there's only a cap of  800 on Nauru - in Malaysia, my apologies. I make a couple of points. Firstly, all the  expert advice that even with a cap of 800, the impact of implementing the Malaysia  agreement would be profound. Secondly, there's a cap on Nauru as well: the  capacity of Nauru under the last governmentwas 1200. It could potentially be taken  to 1500 but no higher. How is that not a cap in the same terms? And could anybody  suggest, could anybody argue that the implementation of the Malaysia agreement  and a detention facility at Nauru would not be a meaningful and real deterrent for  the dangerous boat travel to Australia? Does Mr Abbott seriously suggest that?  Does Mr Morrison seriously suggest that? Their position is untenable. 

 It's time to walk away from the sound grabs, to walk away from the politics and to  enter into meaningful negotiations with the Government. If you want to stop the  boats, you've got to stop the games. This Parliament is being looked at by the  Australian people and the Australian people are wanting to see progress. The  government has made clear, not only in our words but in our actions, we are  prepared to deliver on that commitment to see a breakthrough, to see this impasse  ended. I call on Mr Abbott to do the same. 

 Journalist: If it is that time, Minister Bowen, why don't you just put the legislation to  the Parliament, allow the Parliament to debate it, amend it and put it to a vote? 

 Bowen: Mr Oakeshott's legislation has been debated in the Parliament and has  been considered by the Parliament. The question is not when the legislation goes to  the Parliament, it is will it be passed by the Parliament - and not just the House of  Representatives, the Senate as well. 

 Journalist: Minister Bowen, are you calling on the Greens as well [inaudible]? 

 Bowen: Well, it is true to say, Phil, that the only party that has shown a willingness  to compromise here is the government. The Liberal Party hasn't compromised and  the Greens haven't compromised. 

 I say to the Greens, I fundamentally disagree with their position. It's a naÃ¯ve  position. It's an unworldly position which says that simply some sort of increase in  the humanitarian program would provide a disincentive to get on a boat to Australia.  It is a completely unrealistic position. But I do accept it's their deeply held position. I  can't accuse them of hypocrisy. I can't say they've moved away from a position. 

 On the other hand, the Liberal Party says they with offshore processing, they agree  it will save lives, but they're not prepared to work with us to implement it. 

 We'll go to Karen and then to Matthew. 

 Journalist: Thank you. Are you still saying no [inaudible]? If you are, how can you  genuinely say you're negotiating when you are also laying down [inaudible]? 

 Bowen: Our policy has been clear, our position has been clear, that is the position  we last put to the Opposition. We do believe, based on the expert advice, a very  important part - a very important part - of breaking the people smugglers business  model, that's our position. 

 We've also made clear to the Opposition that the door is open for discussions,  that's the appropriate thing to do. The Opposition has their policy but they're saying 

 that they're not going to discuss it or negotiate it with us any further. We have our  clear policy which I think has been supported by all the evidence. We are also  saying that we are open to further discussions with the Opposition. 

 Journalist: Have you considered the idea that, while reserving your arguments  about what you believe is the best solution, that for the sake of lives - human lives -  maybe you should just cave in, go with the Howard government's system, or if you  have considered that, do you believe that the Coalition would grass that anyway  given Mr Morrison's comments last night? 

 Bowen: Well I've said what I said about Mr Morrison's comments. I do believe that  they are deeply concerning. I also believe this: it is incumbent on the governmentto  put forward what we believe is the best policy. Mr Abbot says, 'We can't support  bad policy', but the governmentshould support a policy that we think is a bad policy,  but they say they can't do it. 

 We've shown that we are willing to implement offshore processing and to embrace  a policy which was not without political difficulty or risk for us, in relation to  embracing Nauru, but we did so because, as I say, I don't think anybody could look  in the mirror and say Nauru plus Malaysia would not stop people dying at sea. Mr  Abbott accepts that, surely he accepts that, and that is the position that we continue  to prosecute. 

 Journalist: Tony Abbott has clarified this morning that if you did offer up the  Coalition's policy they would offer, quote, '… support and encouragement'. 

 Bowen: No, no, with respect David, what he said was that he would welcome us  doing that but it would not see a breakthrough in the impasse, he would not accept  the Government's legislation. Completely different, with respect. 

 Journalist: He did say 'support and encouragement' though. 

 Bowen: Well he's been lecturing that this was appropriate, that this was necessary,  and then Mr Morrison last night laying the groundwork for walking away from that  and saying that it would not be enough to get a breakthrough. 

 Journalist: Minister, one of the motivations it appears with the Opposition is for  them to extract from the government, from a Minister - Cabinet or otherwise - a mea  culpa that in retreating from some of the Howard government measures, you've  actually encouraged the situation we are now in - in fact that it is your fault. Are you  willing, in the spirit of compromise, to admit that Labor was wrong under the  previous governmentand this administration - 

 Bowen: Andrew, I've never heard Mr Abbott say that and if he says that - if he  really thinks that that is what is necessary he should say that and he really is saying  he would withhold support from a deal which would see people's lives being saved  so he could make a political point, that would be very disappointing. 

 I'll say this: I mean, when I became Immigration Minister I took the view that  offshore processing was absolutely essential to saving people's lives. I stood before  the National Conference of the Labor Party and argued for it and argued  successfully; again, not a view which has traditionally sat comfortably with all in the  Labor Party. 

 We do so not because it's easy, not because it is the course of least resistance,  because we believe it is necessary. 

 Journalist: Just to clarify for us, what is actually open to negotiation? 

 Bowen: Well you don't pre-empt negotiations Hugh, you don't walk into  negotiations and say, 'If you raise this we won't talk about it, if you raise that we  won't talk about it'. Now our position is very well known: I've laid out the problems  with turning back the boats, the dangers to it, I've laid out the negatives to  temporary protection visas, et cetera; but in a spirit of goodwill we're not going to  slam the door shut on negotiations and pre-empt what should be in them and not in  them. It's up to those negotiations, if they're sensible and with goodwill to see the  issues resolved. 

 Journalist: What value do you see in the cross-party group of Members of  Parliament [inaudible]? 

 Bowen: Well look, people of goodwill are always welcome in this discussion. I think  the people involved are people of goodwill: Mr Oakeshott, Mr Windsor, Mr  Georganas, Ms Moylan, Dr Washer; they're all people of goodwill. Now even within  that group, I think it is fair to say, there is a difference of views - there is a difference  of views. I think some would say within that group that we should have no offshore  processing, I think Ms Moylan's been on the record saying that; Dr Washer on the  other hand has been more positive about elements of offshore processing and the  government's policies. 

 My door is always open, as it always has been, to people of whatever party to  discuss these issues and if they feel they have a contribution to make I welcome it.  But really, to see a breakthrough here, we're going to need to see some leadership  from the leadership - leadership from the leadership of the Liberal Party. 

 Journalist: Would you consider TPVs, perhaps over a limited period if that's a - 

 Bowen: Well look - 

 Journalist: - get an agreement, see if it works, see if it stops the boats? 

 Bowen: Well Mark, to go back to your question which I relate to Hugh's - Channel 7  and Channel 10 working together- we wouldn't close the door on the negotiations.  We're not going to say prior to negotiations commencing, 'This is in, this is out'. We  want to have genuine discussions with the Opposition in the spirit of goodwill. 

 Now our position is clear, everything I've said about TPVs stands, everything the  Prime Minister says about TPVs stands, but if we're going to have a proper shot at  seeing this sorted and seeing this impasse broken to save people's lives, then the  only responsible thing for us to do is to go into those negotiations with an  appropriate spirit of goodwill. I think you would rightly criticise me if I said, 'Well,  we'll have negotiations but we're not going to accept X, Y and Z'. That would be  wrong. 

 Journalist: You can't back down though, can you sir, on your often strident  condemnation on the notion of turning around boats? I mean you say that's a safety  issue. 

 Bowen: Turning around boats is a safety issue based on the advice of Australia's  naval personnel, that remains our position. As I say, all the policy positions we have  outlined remain our position. I just emphasise, in the spirit of goodwill, if the  Opposition has issues they want to raise with us through the negotiations, we would  be happy to hear them. 

 I need to go and get ready for Question Time, thanks guys.
