  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, 6PR STUDIO, PERTH, 
5 OCTOBER 1999

  

  E & OE - PROOF ONLY

  

 Subjects: East Timor

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Kim Beazley, have you got enough backbone to do the 
job?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, if Mr Howard had a bit of backbone, we’d have 
not had that supine performance in April with General Wiranto and President 
Habibie, and we’d have had a better performance by him when he met 
with Clinton in July. And if he had a bit of common sense now, where 
he would be would be at the South Pacific Forum doing his job, getting 
the people of the South Pacific in behind our commitment in Timor - 
the UN’s commitment in Timor. It’s alright now, everybody is focussed 
on this, but Australia is going to have to be there for years and years, 
and it will be made a darn sight easier if we’ve got the rest of the 
community in the Asian region and in the South Pacific solidly behind 
us.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Do you think that support in the South Pacific is 
fragile?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I think that the support is good now. But you’ve 
got to understand how these things go. Over time people lose interest. 
Over time, the argument against us, against the UN’s commitment, when 
we want to do things like getting the refugees back, like getting the 
militias disarmed, ensuring they don’t come across the border, creating 
the trouble for a new East Timorese state, that’s when we’re going 
to need the understanding and support. Because while this is an international 
thing, serving international objectives, Australia is carrying the weight. 
Now, that’s an argument that I’ve been having with John Howard, 
now, for the last couple of weeks.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Has Paul Keating gone too far on internal bickering 
here? Has he gone too far?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Paul Keating and John Howard have been bickering for 
years. The Australian people don’t like the bickering, but they’ve 
been at it for years. My concern is about the here and now, and the 
future. The here and now is this: we have yet to get a decent resolution 
out of the Indonesian Parliament. We have yet to get a decision from 
the Indonesians, that sticks to allow those 250,000 refugees in West 
Timor back safely. They’re being murdered at the moment, according 
to some reports. And we have to get a long-term acceptance by the Indonesian 
people of the right of the state of Timor to exist, and their non-encouragement 
of the militias. This is a big call. Australia will always carry the 
weight on that. So, our diplomacy has to be as competent as our military 
performance. The military performance is excellent. The diplomacy has 
been ordinary.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What effect is this having, then, on, first of all, 
the troops over there, and the also diplomatic ties with Indonesia?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, diplomatic ties with Indonesia are at an all 
time low and I guess we’ve got to anticipate that that’s going to 
continue. But what we have to do is to ensure that that argument does 
not transport itself into the region around us. It hasn’t so far, 
at least not to a major degree, though there were concerns about the 
expression of the deputy sheriff role that the Prime Minister came up 
to. So, it hasn’t so far. But our problem is not now. Our problem 
is going to be months from now, years from now. That’s when we’re 
going to need the support.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Isn’t it a dereliction of hi s duty, though, to go to the 
South Pacific Forum given there is a national crisis  

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, he’s going to go overseas very shortly to 
other international conferences. He has got five days away on this. 
Guess how long John Curtin spent away in the middle of the war - WWII 
- when there was a direct threat to Australian security? He spent months 
and months. The point is there was an opportunity here and the opportunity 
has been set aside.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Have you asked Paul Keating to stop - to keep his 
mouth shut?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I’m not going to ask Paul Keating to keep his mouth 
shut any more than John Howard would ask his predecessors to keep their 
mouths shut. How can you do that? They’re independent citizens. They’re 
entitled to their opinions and they’re entitled to make their views 
known. And I’m entitled to make my views known. Paul Keating doesn’t 
speak for the Labor Party. He speaks for himself. I speak for the Labor 
Party. And my argument has been this: one, we ye got to give total support 
to the Australian commitment. After all, we, as the Labor Party, have 
been arguing for it for a considerable period of time. Two, we’ve 
got to ensure that the diplomacy honours that commitment, that we secure 
a successful outcome from this. And there’s a lot of water to flow 
under that bridge. And, so far, the pronouncements of the Government, 
be it the deputy sheriffs role, be it the idea of hot pursuit, or whatever, 
have fundamentally flubbed that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 How damaging are Paul Keating’s comments to the 
Labor Party?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, Paul Keating’s comments are his own. They’re 
not the Labor Party’s comments.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But you’ve already had one caller this morning threatening 
to resign his membership. Is it going to be damaging for the Labor Party?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 If that indeed was a member of the Labor Party calling 
in. You never know that. But I get the impression, from the remarks 
that I made at the NSW Conference, where we had 1000 Labor Party members 
listening to the argument that I made - one, about supporting the Australian 
troops; two, about getting the diplomacy right; three, about looking 
at the long haul at what we’ve got to achieve here - the Labor Party 
members who heard my views were absolutely in agreement.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, how damaging do you think the turn in 
the domestic debate is to the morale of the troops in East Timor?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I don’t think that’s damaging at all. If what 
they believe is happening here is that they’re getting the right argument 
over the sort of backup that they need.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Has John Howard got blood on his hands?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 No, John Howard hasn’t got blood on his hands. But 
John Howard has conducted his diplomacy ineffectively, that’s the 
problem. Now, the people with blood on their hands are the murderers 
who killed the people in Timor and drove others out. The incompetence 
with which that was handled internationally is a problem. And this is 
not a new statement from us. We have been saying that for some considerable 
period of time.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, yesterday you seemed to be supporting 
what Keating had to say and today you seem to be going the other way. 
Is there any change?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Not at all. Yesterday, what I was acknowledging was 
the poll driven aspects of the fact that what we’ve got here is a 
Prime Minister arguing to a domestic community which is 85 per cent 
with him on the commitment. The Australian people don’t need an explanation 
about this commitment. The Australian people were there before John 
Howard, as far as the commitment is concerned. But sitting here looking 
at things like the deputy sheriff proposition, all these other things 
which are driven by trying to get up a domestic political agenda, is 
not what we actually need at this moment. What we need now is a bit 
of international sophistication.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But the poll-driven comments weren’t the fact that 
we’re there, they were comments peripheral to that. Is that what you’re 
saying?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 The poll-driven comments were peripheral to that. 
And I see today that Mr Keating came out and said that he supported 
the commitment - which I welcome.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, you’re saying that the diplomacy…hasn’t 
that made...?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, I always believe that the people who ought to 
be identified are those who do the murdering. And they’ve got to be 
identified. They have got to be subject to an international tribunal, 
they’ve got to be punished. Those are the people who did the killing. 
Now, we are entitled to argue about the diplomacy of it. And this is 
not new. Look back at what has been said over some considerable time 
by Labor Party spokespersons. We committed ourselves as a Federal caucus 
in principle to Australian participation in a peacekeeping effort before 
the ballot - in February. My concern is not so much with the old argument. 
That’s an old argument. My concern is where we’re going. And where 
we are going at this moment is unclear. And there is a great deal of 
difficulty out there ahead of Australia and what we’ve got to do is 
focus on the diplomatic requirement we have to get a decent outcome 
from it. And that’s what we’ve got to get up to now. And, frankly, 
the Prime Minister should not be here conducting his 15 year bickering 
with Paul Keating. He shouldn’t be here doing that. He should be in 
the South Pacific doing his job, making certain that the full complexities 
of this are thoroughly understood by people in the South Pacific so 
that when the going gets tough, months from now, we have their support.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 So, what is the decent outcome?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 A decent outcome is this: one, Timor is free; two, 
the 250,000 people across the border are safely back in Timor; three, 
the militias are prevented from molesting their security operating across 
the border; four, there is a good relationship between Timor and their 
neighbours so that there is, long-term, no security problem for it. 
That’s a pretty good challenge, I would have thought.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 And a good relationship between Australia and Indonesia?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Ultimately. And I’m not setting great store by that 
now because I don’t think you can strive after that at the moment, 
quite frankly. It would be desirable, but I think that its achievement 
in the immediate term is not possible. So, what we have to do is to 
ensure that the UN’s commitment holds, is done properly and it ultimately 
achieves the objectives that are set for it.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 ...Major-General Cosgrove...?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I absolutely agree with Major-General Cosgrove that 
his obligation is to ensure the disarmament of all forces in Timor. 
And I would urge Falintil to stack arms with the UN peacekeeping force. 
I think that’s the necessary thing to happen right now. Ultimately, 
of course, the possibility that they would emerge as a security force 
or a police force, or something like that, is very much there. But right 
at this moment, Major-General Cosgrove and the UN forces have a difficult 
task to get peace in that area and that will mean the disarmament of 
all sides.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 How can they disarm when their enemy over the last 
24 years is still in the country?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, the job for security now is a job being very 
well conducted by the UN force. And that deployment over the weekend 
up to the border has started to, I think, create the sort of atmosphere 
internally where their security can be guaranteed. Their security is 
much better guaranteed by those well-trained UN soldiers from many nations 
than it will be by Falintil. And while Falintil is armed it will be 
difficult to disarm the others. So, Major-General Cosgrove is absolutely 
right, and he needs to be backed up.
