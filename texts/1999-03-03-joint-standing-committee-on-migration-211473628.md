  Media Release

  JOINT STANDING 

  COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION

  

  Refugee Council, ICJ to give

  evidence on refugee review fee

  

  The Joint Standing Committee on Migration will hold a public hearing 
for its inquiry into Migration Regulation 4.31B on   Wednesday 3 March at Parliament House in Sydney.

  

 Regulation 4.31 B imposes a $1,000 fee on unsuccessful 
applicants to the Refugee Review Tribunal.

  

 “There has undoubtedly been some abuse of the refugee 
review process,” the Committee Chair, Mrs Chris Gallus MP said.

  

 “The Committee aims to find out whether the $1,000 
fee has reduced that abuse while not deterring genuine refugees.”

  

 “A number of organisations have expressed concern. 
We have already heard from them in Melbourne and we will be hearing 
from more in Sydney.

  

 On Wednesday, the Committee will hear evidence from 
the

 Refugee Council of Australia, the Refugee Advice and 
Casework

 Service and the International Commission of Jurists.

  

 The public hearing will commence at   10.45 am  in the   Jubilee Room.

  

 For further information, contact the Chair, Mrs Chris 
Gallus, on

 0419 800 185 or Ms Margaret Swieringa, Committee Secretary, 
on

 02-6277 4564
