  MIGRANTS ARE GOOD FOR AUSTRALIA - REPORT

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today rel eased a report highlighting the positive effect of migration 
on the Australian Commonwealth Budget.

  

 “The report,   Impact of Migrants on the Commonwealth Budget , was prepared 
by ACIL Consulting. It indicates that, from their second year in Australia, 
the overall impact of people from the Migration and Humanitarian programs 
on the Commonwealth Budget is positive. This positive impact increases 
over time,” said Mr Ruddock.

  

 “The news is even better in the Business and Independent 
Skilled categories where migrants have a positive impact from their 
first year after arrival. This increases over time with obvious benefits 
for the whole Australian community - reinforcing the decision of this 
Government to focus on skilled migration.

  

 “Given that the report is based on the profile of 
migrants who arrived in 1993-95, the overall situation will have improved 
even further due to the increased focus in skilled migration, on employability, 
and a reduction in parent numbers since the Coalition came into office. 
This will have reduced the demand on services provided by the Government 
for these groups and increased contribution to tax revenues.”

  

 “Recent research has consistently highlighted that 
the approach of the Coalition Government to Immigration is the right 
one, and this new report is further evidence. We are encouraging the 
entry of highly skilled migrants because we know they benefit Australia,”   
Mr Ruddock said.

  

 As expected, owing to the circumstances of their arrival 
in Australia, refugee and humanitarian migrants had a negative impact 
in each of the first five years after arrival, although the extent of 
the negative impact reduced over time.

  

 “Preferential or close family migrants also have 
a net negative impact in each of the first five years after arrival, 
and the former Concessional Family category has a net negative impact 
during the first three years after arrival and then has a positive impact 
in the two subsequent years.

  

 “Nevertheless, the Government will continue to fulfil 
our obligations in assisting family reunion,” he said.

  

 Mr Ruddock added that the Council of Ministers for 
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs had agreed that information on 
the impact of migration on individual State and Territory budgets was 
limited. The Council, therefore, has also commissioned a research project 
on the impact of migration on individual State and Territory budgets. 
This project is still in the planning stages.
