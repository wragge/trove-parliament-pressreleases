 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania    

 

 32,000 pleas to the PM 

 Senator Brown, 14th June 2006   

 Greens Leader Bob Brown will today table a petition, coordinated by GetUp, of more  than 32,000 signatures calling on the government to drop its legislation to ship  asylum-seekers offshore for processing and detention.    

 "More than 75% of Australians disagree with the new immigration laws, more than  32,000 people have lent their name to this petition. A Senate committee has  recommended the government scraps the laws and it is time the Prime Minister  stopped ignoring Australians," Senator Brown said.    

 "These new laws contravene Australia's obligation to asylum seekers under the UN  refugee convention and they will ensure women and children are locked up with no  access to legal recourse in Australia. They are a national disgrace."    

 "The Indonesian delegation currently in Australia wants the decision to grant 42 West  Papuans asylum reviewed. Will the Prime Minister listen to the Indonesians or to his  Australian constituents?" Senator Brown said.
