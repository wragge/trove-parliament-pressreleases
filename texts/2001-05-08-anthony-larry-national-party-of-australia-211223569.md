 $1.4 M TO HELP QUEENSLAND FAMILIES

 Federal Minister for Community Services, Larry Anthony, today announced more than $1.4 million for nine projects across Queensland aimed at making a real difference to people's lives.

 Mr Anthony said the funding was provided under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, a four-year national program which funds projects that help in early intervention, parenting, family and relationship support.

 "The strategy has a strong emphasis on prevention and early intervention, encouraging local solutions to local problems and building strength within communities," Mr Anthony said.

 "In the long term this will mean more capable families and communities who have less need for crisis services and welfare support."

 Mr Anthony said the projects approved included -A partnership project with Centrelink, the Family Assistance Office and the community to provide an ideal, single access point for families to receive support following a family breakdown;

 A community garden in Townsville targeting socially isolated older people, new migrants and refugees; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A parent aide program at Hervey Bay focussing on early intervention and support for families with young children at risk of abuse or neglect; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 An early intervention program which promotes a tailored package of family lifeskills training and support to young migrant and humanitarian entrant families in high need.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Mr Anthony said local authorities, community agencies and family support groups will set-up and deliver the programs.

 "The Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is a clear example of what can be

 achieved when government and the community work together.

 "The Federal Government is commited to building strong, supportive communities by helping parents, young people, older citizens and families," said Mr Anthony.
