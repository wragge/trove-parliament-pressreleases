 Settlement services funding opportunities in Aston  

 Aston MP Chris Pearce today encouraged interested Aston organisations to consider  applying for funding in the 2003 round of the Community Settlement Services  Scheme.   

 Mr Pearce said the new funding round will extend and complement the existing  network of services assisting refugees, humanitarian entrants and migrants to settle  successfully in Australia and become full and active participants in Australia’s  democratic society.   

 “The Minister has indicated that he intends to give priority to projects which deliver  services to recent arrivals whose communities in Australia are small and emerging; to  projects catering for refugee and humanitarian entrants; and to projects meeting the  unique needs of new migrants in regional areas”, Mr Pearce said.   

 In 2003, funding is available for periods of nine or twenty-one months from 1 October  2003 in order to align the scheme with the next financial year.   

 Funding priority will be given to projects which:   · Facilitate client access to mainstream services;   · Develop settlement planning and service delivery networks that engage mainstream  service providers to deliver culturally appropriate services; and  · Aim to be self-sustaining beyond the period of the grant.   

 Application forms and further information is available online at  www.immi.gov.au/grants. Applications close 21 March 2003.
