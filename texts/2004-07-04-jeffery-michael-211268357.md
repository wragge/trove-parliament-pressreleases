 ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC

 GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

 ON THE OCCASION OF

 INDEPENDENCE DAY DINNER AMERICAN CLUB, SYDNEY

 4 JULY 2004

 Mr Lawrie Gibbs, President American Club Mr John Wells, Director American Club Mr Brendon Sandford, General Manager, American Club Mr Michael Baume, Club Committee Member Members of The American Society Members of the Australian-American Association Mrs Gwynneth May, President of Rotary District 9570 Distinguished guests Ladies and gentlemen

 Thankyou for inviting Marlena and me to the American Club to celebrate this very special day in world history - July  4, American Independence Day.

 Since 1947, the American Club has fostered closer social and economic ties between Australia and the United States. It  hosts a number of events important to Australian and American national culture including ANZAC Day, Australia  Day, Thanksgiving and 4th of July celebrations.

 Tonight’s dinner provides members of American origin - or those with social and or business associations and their  guests - with an opportunity to celebrate their day of independence.

 This celebration, in such a far away country as Australia, serves to reinforce to US citizens and their guests the real  meaning of freedom, independence and the special lifestyle that only democracy engenders.

 Of all the great powers throughout history, America surely has had one of the greatest impacts on the world, especially  the modern world.

 For centuries, men and women from all over the globe have seen in America a place where they could realise their  dreams, whether for material prosperity or social justice.

 Founded on a philosophy of an individual’s inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, America  could be said to have perhaps vindicated Plato's warning that "until philosophers are kings, the human race will never  have rest from its evils."

 America’s founding philosophy encouraged the development of science and technology and, along with countries like 

 the United Kingdom, modern industrial society.

 As a result, the horse-and-buggy was replaced by automobiles built by Henry Ford; wagon tracks by steel rails  produced by Andrew Carnegie; and candles by electricity harnessed by Thomas Edison.

 The resulting increase in freedom, wealth, comfort, and life expectancy in the Unites States, has helped to improve the  standard of living worldwide.

 Australia and the United States share common values in a relationship of substance, embracing ties of history,  commerce and culture, and a profound mutual interest in maintaining a strong US presence globally and within the  Asia-Pacific region.

 This relationship has been forged over the centuries from the time the first United States ship to enter an Australian  port - the "Philadelphia" - arrived in Sydney in 1792.

 Linked by formal alliance for more than 50 years, both countries share a deep commitment to democracy, international  security and an open world trading system.

 The cornerstones of our relationship are founded in the Australian-US security treaty (ANZUS) and US and Australian  participation in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.

 The US is an important market for Australia's exports. In 2003, our imports from America were worth US$13.087  billion while Australian exports to the US were valued at US$6.413 billion.

 While I readily acknowledge the current debate concerning the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, it is  clear that the governments of both countries expect significant benefits to result.

 For example when the Agreement comes into force, potentially in early next year, it is expected that significant new  benefits and opportunities for Australian exporters will be created.

 These could include:

 â     Elimination of duties on over 97 per cent of US tariff lines for Australia’s non-agricultural exports (excluding 

 textiles and clothing); â     Improved access for Australian agriculture, with 66 per cent of agricultural tariff lines going to zero from day 

 one and a further nine per cent cut to zero within four years; â     Full access for the first time for Australian goods and services to the $200 billion market for US federal 

 government procurement; and â     Enhanced legal protections that guarantee market access and non-discriminatory treatment for Australian 

 service providers in the US market, with only limited exceptions.

 Over time, benefits from the Agreement promise to flow to all sectors of the Australian economy.

 There are also substantial people-to-people trade links, with more than 600,000 business visitors and tourists travelling  between Australia and the US each year.

 This high level of contact - combined with a common language, business culture and comparative legal and political  systems - makes Australia an attractive site for regional headquarters for those US companies establishing operations  in the Asia-Pacific region.

 Australia and the United States have a long history of close defence and security cooperation. Australian and US forces  have served alongside each other in both World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Somalia, Afghanistan and, most  recently, in Iraq.

 Ongoing defence cooperation includes the operation of the joint defence facilities, and Australian support for US  deployments in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions through access to ports, airfields and maintenance facilities.  Both countries' forces also exercise and train together on a regular basis.

 The US is an important source of high technology defence equipment for Australia, contributing valuably to Australia's  self-reliant defence posture: the F18, the Joint Strike Fighter, the Abrams tank purchase and the anti missile defence  initiative being but some examples.

 America's security commitment to the Asia-Pacific region provides an essential stabilising influence, at a time when  power relativities are changing and countries are acquiring modern defence capabilities.

 It provides security to its allies through its support of organisations such as the United Nations, the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation and the World Trade Organisation, and bilateral treaties and agreements with countries throughout  the world.

 The American economy directly influences world economies by generating more than 25 per cent of the global  economy. The New York Stock Exchange dictates the trends on world stock markets while the greenback is the most  trusted currency in the world, with most transactions being conducted in US dollars.

 American companies invest heavily in foreign markets while grants to many aid programs help developing countries  all around the world.

 Its military presence in many strategic locations accompanied by political agreements, helps stabilise the Persian Gulf  region, the Korean Peninsular and the Balkans.

 These alliances steady markets and enhance economic growth, as happened in Western Europe and Japan after World  War II.

 The introduction of the Marshall Plan after that conflict rebuilt Germany and Japan, strengthened the European allies  both economically and politically, and created permanent economic links into Europe and East Asia.

 The civilised world today would be a very different place if America had not intervened decisively in two world wars  and taken part in modern UN peacekeeping and security operations.

 After World War II, the US took responsibility for territories traditionally under the British sphere of influence. Iran,  Greece and Turkey were provided security guarantees that the British could no longer provide.

 The US sphere of influence expanded to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, with the US guaranteeing 

 their security through formal and informal agreements.

 At the outbreak of the Cold War, the US created the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949 - the first  peacetime alliance in the history of the United States - and other regional defensive blocs such as the ANZUS  (Australia, New Zealand and the United States) Treaty in 1951 and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO)  in 1954.

 Post Cold War, the United States remains committed to global security, endeavouring to ensure peace and security  with countries around the world who are cooperating in the war against terrorism.

 In the aftermath of the traumatic events of September 11 - which shook the nation to its core - the world witnessed the  huge reserves of resilience and strength in the American character. Its people showed they could not be easily  demoralised.

 The importance of the US to a free, secure and prosperous world is not likely to diminish in the foreseeable future, and  it is hard to imagine any substantial improvement to global standards of living without the powerful American engine  room to drive it.

 As the nation with the world’s largest economy, the United States plays a key role on the international, political and  economic stages. The United States is also the largest trading nation in the world, exporting and importing more goods  and services than any other country.

 In 1800, Asia produced 57 percent of world manufacturing, the West only 29 percent. By 1900, the West was  producing 86 percent, Asia only 10 percent. Today, America’s production of world wealth, both absolutely and  relatively, is accelerating.

 Now, this international trade, so largely US driven, helps increase the total level of production and consumption in the  world, lowers the costs of production and prices that consumers pay, and thus increases standards of living.

 Culturally, whilst America has had, and will continue to have, a definitive influence on the cultural moves of countries  around the world, it should be remembered that as a nation of immigrants from the 19th to the 21st centuries - and as a  haven in the 1930s and '40s for many refugee scholars and artists - the United States has been a recipient, as much as  an exporter, of global culture.

 One of its exports for which I have a great admiration is Rotary. I am pleased to see it represented here tonight by  members of the Rotary Club of Gymea.

 Throughout my term as Governor of Western Australia and now as Governor-General of Australia, I have always  maintained close ties with Rotary and have enormous respect for the work Rotarians do.

 Rotarians plan and carry out a remarkable variety of humanitarian, educational, and cultural exchange programs that  touch people’s lives in local communities and in our world community.

 Each year, The Rotary Foundation provides some US$90 million for international scholarships, cultural exchanges,  and humanitarian projects, large and small that helps to improve understanding and the quality of life for millions of  people. Rotary is widely regarded as the world’s largest private provider of international education scholarships.

 Rotary’s PolioPlus campaign aims to eradicate polio globally by the year 2005, Rotary’s 100th anniversary. More than  one billion children in developing nations have been immunised against polio through PolioPlus grants.

 I would like to conclude by suggesting there could be merit in encouraging moves whereby Australia, as a respected  middle level power, continues expanding its regional engagement with China, India, ASEAN and the Pacific nations.

 We initiated the APEC forum, which has grown enormously in stature and influence. The United Sates recognised and  embraced the APEC ideals.

 Australia stands on its record and proven capacity to promote measures for the betterment of mankind, be they trade  related, defence or tourism - sharing and developing dialogue and greater understanding amongst people, nations and  governments.

 As I have indicated, we have much to thank America for. But today, as we join you in celebrating the birthday and  independence of a great people and a great nation, we remind ourselves that Australia is also a nation with much to  offer.

 As Australia strives to be a nation of excellence, extending our influence to become the global example, the United  States and many other countries will also benefit. And what a worthy way to wish you all a happy 4th of July.

 Thank you.
