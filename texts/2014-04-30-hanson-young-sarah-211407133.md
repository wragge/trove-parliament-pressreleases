 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, April 30, 2014   

 Abbott’s refugee dump in Cambodia,  irresponsible and dangerous   

 The Abbott Government’s proposed deal to dump refugee children in Cambodia will put them in  serious danger, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “With a history of whippings, caning and electric shock torture in Cambodia, it’s clear that it’s an  unacceptable dumping ground for refugees,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The UN has slammed Australia for its dodgy deal with Cambodia and the Abbott Government  must recognise that it is on the verge of making a terrible mistake.   

 “With the rape of women and girls on the rise, and increasingly young girls being targeted, it’s  deeply disappointing that Tony Abbott thinks it’s an appropriate place to send children.   

 “There is no way that the Australian Government can guarantee that refugee children will be  safe or have access to a proper education in Cambodia.   

 “The Abbott Government is being so secretive about its new refugee dump that the Australian  people have to find out about it from Cambodian authorities.   

 “The Coalition’s plan to dump refugee families in Cambodia, after vigorously opposing the  Malaysia deal while in opposition, makes it clear that they are only playing politics with people’s  lives.   

 “A genuine regional solution would see Australia burden sharing, not burden shifting, when it  comes to refugees.”
