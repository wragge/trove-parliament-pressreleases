 GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO SETTLEMENT SERVICES   

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today  reassured established migrant communities that the Government remains committed  to migrant and refugee settlement services.   

 “The Government is committed to the continuing development of a strong and  effective network of settlement service providers to address the needs of established  migrant communities,” Mr Hardgrave said.   

 Mr Hardgrave said recent claims about changes to Community Settlement Services  Scheme (CSSS) funding arrangements are unfounded and unhelpful.   

 “There has been no change to eligibility criteria for the 2004 CSSS grants round,” Mr  Hardgrave said.    

 “This means that all organisations that currently receive  funding are eligible to apply  for funding in 2004,” he said.   

 “Every organisation, including any from established migrant communities, that have  applied for funding in the current round will have their application assessed on its  merits, as in the past.   

 “My department will hold community consultations on funding arrangements for the  combined grants program in April 2004,” Mr Hardgrave said.   

 “The community will be able to put forward their ideas on things such as the  objectives of their program, eligibility, assessment criteria, work programs and  accountability measures.”
