  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE FEDERAL OPPOSITION, THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY 
MP

  

  KOSOVO REFUGEES NEED COMFORT, NOT ISOLATION

  

  While I reaffirm my in-principle support for the Government’s legislation 
to provide short-term refuge for  4,000 people displaced from 
Kosovo, I am concerned that both Mr Howard and Mr Ruddock appear keen 
to have these people housed in remote defence establishments. These 
people need succour, not further isolation. We need to be generous, 
not grudging.

  

 It is my view that the refugees should be housed closer 
to populated areas - closer to the people who are giving them refuge 
and closer to the agencies that provide support and news of their loved 
ones back home. Billeting should not be discounted.

  

 The Howard/Ruddock call for remote settlement smacks 
of ‘out of sight, out of mind’.

  

 I repeat my call for consideration of more permanent 
places being built into our immigration program for Kosovo refugees 
in response to a UNHCR request. And I repeat my concerns that President 
Milosevic must not be rewarded for his actions. A peaceful solution 
in Kosovo must be found.
