 Australian assistance for Man Jayan refugees

 Australia is to provide further assistance to Irian Jaya border crossers living in Papua New Guinea, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will receive an extra $500,000 in Australian funding to go towards its program on the PNG border.

 Mr Kerin said there were now about 6,400 Irian Jaya border crossers in PNG who needed help.

 "These people are living in difficult and isolated conditions. The main access to the official UNHCR East Awin Camp is a bush track through mountainous terrain," Mr Kerin said.

 "To survive these conditions they require medical assistance and extensive support in the form of food, shelter and clothing," he said.

 Around 3,400 of the border crossers live in the East Awin camp. The remaining 3,000 live in various unofficial border camps which receive no assistance from the UNHCR but are given some support from local non-government organisations.

 Mr Kerin said the Australian assistance would be in the form of a $350,000 cash grant; to the UNHCR and the provision of 255 tonnes of Australian rice valued at $150,000.

 Since 1984 Australia has contributed $7.7m to the LTNHCR PNG/Irian Jaya border crossers program. This includes the latest $500,000 grant.

 The assistance is provided through emergency relief funds administered by Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB.
