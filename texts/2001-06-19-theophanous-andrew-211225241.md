  MP OFFICIAILLY REQUESTS INQUIRY 

  INTO PORT HEDLAND INCIDENT   FROM HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION 

  Independent MP Dr Theophanous will today refer the claims of abusive behaviour of   guards and officials at Port Hedland Detention Centre to the Human Rights and Equal   Opportunity Commission (HREOC). 

  In response to a Question w:thout Notice from Dr Theophanous, Minister Ruddock   today supported such an investigation. He   said: “I have indicated that I would ask   HREOC to under-take such an Inyuiy in relation to the matters that you raise. ” 

  In his Question, Dr Theophanous maintained that the Minister had been misled with   regards to the incident on I1 May that sparked the police raid at Port Hedland   Detention Centre on 26 May. 

  “There are very disturbing aliegations in relation to the events on both of those days.   Before Question time, I handed Minister Ruddock a copy of a letter I was given while   at Port Hedland, signed by 116 detainees, spelling out the inhumane and barbaric   treatment meted out towards them from ACM guards and officials. 

  “This letter, together with written statements from other groups of refugee-claimants,   provides a very different account of events to that which has been put about by   DIMA. 

  “It further confirms the accounts given to me by eight detainees at Port Hedland   Detention Centre and eighteen detainees at Perth’s Hakea Prison, where I saw   physical evidence of beatings, and also received comprehensive accounts of the   events which took place. 

  “These same persons repeated the claims regarding the bashing of a 16-year-old   detainee, the report of which., the Minister today confirmed, had sparked the incident   (although insisting that the #allegation is untrue). An investigation into the alleged   bashing of the boy is now being undertaken by the Commonwealth Ombudsman at 

  my request. 

  “I shall be continuing my fight for justice for the asylum-seekers, and for the full   extent of inhumane treatment in Detention Centres to be exposed and reformed”, Dr   Theophanous concluded.
