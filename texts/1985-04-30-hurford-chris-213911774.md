 MIGRATION TALKS IN GREECE

 Athens, 27 April; "As economic conditions continue to  improve, the Australian Government will examine whether it  is possible to ease the arrangements for family reunion,"  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister  Assisting the Treasurer, Chris Hurford, said in Athens  today.

 "This could have significant benefit for the Greek community  in Australia."

 Mr Hurford was speaking at the end of an official visit to  Greece, during which he discussed immigration and ethnic  affairs with the Greek Government and community leaders.

 "I assured Greek authorities that Australia places a high  value on continuing the excellent links with Greece," Mr  Hurford said.

 "The Greek community in Australia has made an outstanding  contribution to the development and culture of our nation.

 â Future immigration flows can only strengthen further the  relations between our two nations."

 Mr Hurford said that Greek authorities had been anxious to  ensure he was fully aware of the extent to which Greece was  providing temporary asylum to refugees from Eastern Europe  and the Middle East.

 There are now more than 3,000 persons in Greece who claim to  be refugees and who are seeking resettlement in other  countries.

 Mr Hurford said he had untertaken to carry this message to  Australia and see if we could do even more to help.
