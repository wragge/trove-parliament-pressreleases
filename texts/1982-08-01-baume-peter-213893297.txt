 GUIDELINES 2

 AUGUST 1982

 GUIDELINES FOR THE COMMONWEALTH TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION - 1983

 (Including Budget Decisions)

 For 1983, grants totalling $1,876.35 million will be provided for 

 tertiary education representing an increase of 0.4 per cent cm 1982.

 All amounts in this statement are expressed in constant 1982 outturn 

 prices.

 The total allocation for tertiary education includes provision for the 

 Australian National University, the Canberra College of Advanced 

 Education, the Australian Maritime College and non-government teachers 

 colleges.

 Total funds include recurrent grants for universities and colleges of 

 advanced education for 1983 of $1,561.4 million previously determined by 

 the Government as part of the triennial arrangements for the 1982-84 

 triennium as well as $0.25 million for other recurrent initiatives 

 indicated below. The capital and equipment funds for all three sectors 

 and recurrent grants for TAPE are provided on an annual basis and these 

 allocations, totalling $314.3 million are included in the accompanying 

 table.

 The Government has decided to provide $0.2 million in the 1982-83 

 financial year fcr cultural awareness and ethnic language familiarisation 

 courses within the normal education programs of tertiary institutions for 

 Australian professionals and para-professionals. These funds will be 

 transferred from the Department of Education to the Commonwealth Tertiary 

 Education Commission.

 The Government also has decided that the Commission should pursue with 

 tertiary institutions steps to ensure that multicultural perspectives and 

 components are introduced into tertiary courses.

 The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission is asked to prepare 

 recommendations on the distribution of these funds in accordance with 

 these guidelines. To enable consideration of these recommendations and

 GUIDELINES 3

 passage of the necessary legislation during the Budget Sittings, the 

 Commission is asked to report by 31 August 1982.

 Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education

 The total allocation for higher education for 1983 is $1,669.25 million. 

 This represents an increase of 0.4 per cent in real terms over the 1982 

 allocation. -

 Allocations for recurrent programs have been increased to provide 

 additional funds in 1983 and 1984 to meet rising costs of staff 

 superannuation schemes and to reflect the Government's recent decision to 

 provide an extra $150,000 in 1983 for the support of ratings training at 

 the Australian Maritime College.

 Funds for capital programs have been increased by $5.8 million 

 representing an increase of 16.7 per cent over the capital funds provided 

 in 1982. These increased funds will enable all commitments arising from 

 on-going capital projects to be met, and will allow $1.6 million for the 

 construction of additional student accommodation associated with the 

 provision of ratings training at the Australian Maritime College. The 

 allocation for new capital projects and minor works will be maintained at 

 the same level as for 1982. Grants for equipment programs will also be 

 maintained in 1983 at the 1982 level. The cost of equipment programs for 

 ratings training at the Australian Maritime College will need to be met 

 from this grant.

 Technical and Further Education

 For 1983 the Commonwealth will provide $206.6 million for technical and 

 further education in the States and Northern Territory. In co-operation 

 with the States, the Commission is asked to recommend the distribution of 

 these funds having regard to degrees of need and on the understanding 

 that the States and Northern Territory will at least maintain fully their 

 own total efforts in this area.

 GUIDELINES 4

 The 1982 capital program for TAPE includes the last instalment of the 

 special '$50 million' program which commenced in 1979. For 1983, the 

 Commonwealth will continue the base program of TAPE capital expenditure 

 at its existing level of $90.7 million. In addition, it will fund the 

 first year of a new three-year National Priority Projects Program under 

 which an additional $60 million in money terms will be provided to meet 

 specialised industry needs, and to give training opportunities to young 

 people where facilities are lacking.

 The Commission is asked to put forward recommendations on the expenditure 

 of up to $20 million on this special program in 1983. The Commission 

 should take into account, in particular, the provision of facilities to 

 meet needs of industry which are emerging as a result of economic and 

 technological changes, some of which might be met by projects which serve 

 several States. It should also take into account provision for the .  

 expansion of vocational education opportunities, particularly for young: 

 people, in population centres where appropriate facilities are lacking.

 Recurrent funds for TAPE have been increased by 4.4 per cent in 1983 to 

 $88.3 million. In addition to the funds provided to compensate the 

 States for fees foregone, this amount includes $26.4 million to assist 

 with the qualitative improvement of TAPE. An amount of $10.1 million, 

 the same as for 1982, will be provided for the supplementary equipment 

 program which the Commonwealth introduced last year.

 Following its consideration of the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs 

 and Services for Migrants by the Australian Institute of Multicultural 

 Affairs, the Government has decided that priority for the use of 

 particular purpose TAPE funds should be given to advanced English 

 language instruction for specific purposes for migrants, with support 

 provided at the level of 15 per cent of particular purpose TAPE funds.

 The CTEC is asked to discuss the implementation of this decision with the 

 States and report by the end of October on the most appropriate method of 

 giving full effect to this decision within 12 months. To facilitate the 

 implementation of these arrangements, the Government has decided to 

 transfer to the Commission $1.1 million in a full year from the Adult

 GUIDELINES 5

 Migrant Education Program of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic 

 Affairs. In preparing its Volume 1 Report for the 1985-87 triennium, the 

 Commission should note the Government's acceptance of the AIMA proposal 

 in paragraph 5.127 of its Report that, for the next triennium, funds for 

 the above purpose should come from the TAPE general purpose recurrent 

 grants program. .

 Tertiary Education

 The Government has reviewed the prospective allowance for cost increases 

 in 1982 recurrent programs in higher education and has found that the 

 allowance has proved adequate to date. The Government has received the 

 Report of the Academic Salaries Tribunal recommending an increase of 

 7 per cent in academic salaries. The Government will be considering the 

 Report as soon as possible.

 The table which follows sets out the funds which will be provided for 

 individual programs for 1983 compared with the funds for 1982, in the 

 same price terms.

 GUIDELINES 8

 AUGUST 1982

 GUIDELINES FOR THE COMMONWEALTH SCHOOIS COMMISSION - 1983 

 (Including Budget Decisions)

 The value of programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission 

 is continuing to increase in real terms. In 1983 the increase will be 

 3.9 per cent. Grants totalling $1,240.8 million will be provided, 

 compared with $1,194.3 million in 1982. All 1983 program amounts in this 

 statement are on an outturn basis and for the purposes of comparison 

 those for 1982 are expressed in the same price terms. As in the past, 

 recurrent grants for non-government schools and for part-tirte ethnic ·  

 schools will be made on a per capita basis with the total allocations ,  

 being determined by actual enrolments.

 The Commission is asked to prepare recommendations on the detailed 

 allocation of the funds consistent with these guidelines and as set 

 out in the accompanying tables. To enable consideration of these 

 recommendations and passage of the necessary legislation during the 

 Budget Sittings, the Commission is asked to report by 31 August 1982.

 General Resources Program

 Government Schools

 . General Recurrent Grants;

 The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation to increase 

 in real terms general recurrent grants for government schools by 2 per 

 cent or $6.3 million. These additional resources, which will be 

 available to each State for general educational purposes in government 

 schools, further underline the Government's commitment to all Australian 

 schools. Although there have been overall decreases in government school 

 enrolments, these additional general recurrent grants will assist States 

 to overcome the financial difficulties which the Commission reported were 

 facing government school systems.

 GUIDELINES 9

 . Capital Grants:

 As recommended by the Commission, the Government will maintain in real 

 terms the present level of funding for government school buildings. In 

 order to ensure that the Commonwealth’s effort is specifically directed 

 to identified areas of need in government schools, the Government has 

 also accepted the Commission's proposal that a new places element be 

 introduced into the Capital Grants Program. The Government asks the 

 Commissi cm to recommend on the size of this new element and appropriate 

 weightings in its recommendations on capital allocations among States.

 It also asks the Commission to consider and report cm the effects of the 

 new element on existing elements within the program. The Government is 

 unable to 'accept the recommendation that States be given forward 

 commitment arrangements for government schools capital programs. The 

 Commission is asked to follow up the Government's approach to the States 

 and report on the following arrangements in relation to the Commonwealth's 

 capital program for government schools:

 (i) the adoption of measures to obtain greater identification of 

 Commonwealth capital funds for government schools, including 

 States advising in advance of proposals for expenditure of 

 Commonwealth funds for the approval of the Commonwealth Minister;

 (ii) ,  measures which might be taken to encourage the States to maintain 

 their effort from their own financial resources for government 

 school building programs; and

 (iii) a joint review, with State and non-government school authorities, 

 of the rationalisation of school building provision, taking into 

 account the implications of changing enrolment patterns within and 

 between government and non-government schools and between schools 

 and TAPE.

 Non-Government Schools

 . General Recurrent Grants:

 The Government will continue to provide all non-government schools in 

 Australia with a basic grant equal to 20 per cent of the standard cost of 

 educating a student in a government school and additional grants on the

 GUIDELINES 10

 basis of need. In accordance with its 1980 election commitments, the 

 additional grants for Group 3 non-government schools, those with greatest 

 need, will be raised in 1983 iron 18 to 20 per cent of standard costs. 

 That is, in 1983, the Government will provide per capita grants for non- 

 go vernment schools on the following basis:

 Group 1 schools: 20 per cent of standard costs

 Grotp 2 schools: 30 per cent of standard costs

 Group 3 schools: 40 per cent of standard costs.

 As recommended by the Commission, the Short-Term Emergency Assistance 

 Program for non-government schools is reduced to $0.6 million in 1983 

 because of significantly reduced demand.

 . Capital Grants:

 The Government will provide the third portion of the $25 million in money 

 terms it promised over three years in the 1980 election to help meet the 

 demand for new student places in non-government schools; $9 million is 

 allocated for this purpose in 1983. However, the Government has not 

 adopted the Commission1s recommendation that it authorise the forward 

 commitment of up to 90 per cent of the 1983 level of funds for new places 

 for non-government capital funds for 1984 and 1985. Forward commitment 

 arrangements will continue to apply to the basic level of capital funding 

 for non-government schools.

 Special Purpose Programs for Government and Non-Government Schools 

 . English as a Second Beinguage Program:

 The Government has agreed to the Commission's proposal that the provision 

 for transferring any surplus funds from the New Arrivals element to the 

 General Support element of the English as a Second Language Program be 

 discontinued. Following its review of the Evaluation of Post-Arrival 

 Programs and Services for Migrants conducted by the Australian Institute 

 of Multicultural Affairs (AIMA), the Government has accepted the 

 Commission's recommendation for additional funds for the New Arrivals 

 element of the English as a Second Language Program; cin additional $1.8 

 million has therefore been provided to meet the demand for services as a 

 result of the projected increase in newly arrived students.

 GUIDELINES 11

 Consistent with the Government's decisions on the Evaluation of Post­

 Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants, the Commission is asked to 

 initiate a research program to provide information on the English 

 language competence of students from non-English-speaking backgrounds, to 

 identify factors affecting that competence and to develop methods of 

 assessing the English language proficiency of migrant children. Funds' 

 for this research are to be provided from within existing programs.

 The Commission is asked to ensure that the funds for the Multicultural 

 Education Program are allocated between community language and other 

 multicultural education activities on an approximately equal basis. The 

 present funding of multicultural projects of national significance should 

 be transferred to the Special Projects Program and should support both a 

 multicultural education and a community languages element.

 The Commission should broaden its review of the operations of the Multi­

 cultural Education Program to include an evaluation of the impact of the 

 Program on school curricula and programs including:

 _ . an assessment of the developments undertaken in multicultural

 education through Multicultural Education Program funding;

 . an evaluation of the impact of these developments;

 . an assessment of future community language teaching needs;

 â¢ a phased program for multicultural education and community 

 language teaching to be met by recurrent funding to schools.

 The Government has not accepted the Commission's recommendation that 

 additional funds be provided for non-dislocation grants to school systems 

 affected by the new formula for the distribution of funds under the , 

 English as a Second,Language Program. The per capita grants of up to $30 

 for ethnic schools will be continued in 1983 and will be considered 

 further following the current survey of needs by the Commission.

 GUIDELINES 12

 . Special Education Program:

 The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that 

 eligibility criteria for the Special Education Program be altered to 

 enable participation by handicapped children of below school age who 

 require early educational intervention services; appropriate provision 

 will be made in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) legislation.

 The Commission is asked to recommend on ways of achieving this purpose 

 within the Special Education Program for government and non-government 

 schools.

 . Disadvantaged Schools Program:

 The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that funds 

 for the Disadvantaged Schools Program be maintained at the present level 

 in real terms. The Government has also agreed to the Commission's 

 recommendation for a further minor transfer in 1983 of funds under the 

 Disadvantaged Schools Program between sectors, consistent with the 

 Commission's revised funding formula.

 The Government has not agreed to the Commission's recommendation that it 

 introduce a new School Improvement Program in 1983.

 Joint Programs Shared between Government and Non-Government Schools

 The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that the 

 Severely Handicapped Children's Program be increased by 25 per cent or 

 $0.7 million. The Government will provide the same real level of funds 

 for the Professional Development Program for 1983 (including funds for 

 Education Centres) as recommended by the Commission. In addition, to 

 meet the need for more efficient and longer term budgeting in this 

 program, the Government has accepted the Commission's request that it be 

 permitted to enter into forward commitment arrangements with individual 

 Education Centres for 1984 and 1985, up to 70 per cent per annum of the 

 1983 level. The Commission is asked to report on the operation of the 

 Professional Development Program with a view to ensuring that the full 

 range of schools in the government and non-government sectors have access 

 to the program and, if necessary, negotiate with the States to achieve

 GUIDELINES 13

 this end. The Government will not be providing the proposed additional 

 funds for the Country Areas Program in 1983 but it will be maintained in 

 real terms at the 1982 level.

 The Government will provide some additional funds in 1982, and again in 

 1983, to enable extended participation by schools in the Australian 

 Capital Territory in the Special Education, Professional Development and 

 Disadvantaged Schools Programs. The Government will not be extending 

 further the range of these programs in 1983 as proposed by the Commission

 Additional Allowances for Cost Increases in 1982

 The Government has reviewed the existing cost adjustment provision for 

 the Commission's 1982 programs. It has decided that sane additional 

 funds should be made available beyond present prospective arrangements to 

 cover unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary 

 determinations. For government school general recurrent grants it has 

 decided to provide an additional $10.4 million. This will meet approx­

 imately two-thirds of the estimated salary increases over and above those 

 already provided for in the existing prospective allowance. Having 

 regard to the fact that Commonwealth general recurrent grants constitute 

 only 7 per cent of government school recurrent costs, the Government 

 believes that this additional allocation to the States for 1982 should 

 assist them to maintain resource standards in government schools.

 For non-government schools the additional funds for general recurrent 

 grants will be provided to preserve the Government's 1980 election 

 commitment to pay general recurrent grants to non-government schools at 

 the rates of 20, 30 and 38 per cent of average government school standard 

 costs in 1982. This will significantly assist these schools to cope with 

 the financial problems they are currently experiencing as a result of 

 unexpectedly high salary increases this year. The cost of this 

 additional provision for non-government schools will be $25.7 million.

 The Government will also provide additional funds to supplement fully 

 increases in salary costs in all of the special purpose and joint 

 programs of the Commission for both government and non-government 

 schools. This will require an additional $8.8 million in 1982.

 GUIDELINES 14

 Far 1983 the prospective allowance has been determined on the same basis 

 as announced in last year's Guidelines.

 The following tables set out the funds provided for individual programs 

 in 1983 compared with 1982 in both constant 1983 outturn prices and 

 estimated December 1981 prices, the latter being the price basis of the 

 Commission's recommendations published earlier this year.

 Statement STATEMENT 1

 THE BUDGET AND EDUCATION

 BUDGET STATEMENT BY SENATOR THE HON. PETER BAUME,

 MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, 17 AUGUST 1982

 The purpose of this statement is to give particulars of further 

 important new measures and major changes to be introduced in the 

 Government's education programs: they include a very significant

 upgrading of student assistance programs at an additional cost of 

 nearly $60 million, and the proposed introduction in 1983 of a tertiary 

 student loans scheme. I have already announced in the guidelines to 

 the Education Commissions for 1983 programs (21 June 1982), the 

 provision of $2,986 million for schools and tertiary education 

 institutions, an increase in real terms of $45 million over calendar 

 year 1982.

 The combined effect of decisions taken in the immediate Budget context, 

 together with increases in Commission programs announced in June, are 

 expected in this financial year to result in total direct outlays on 

 education of $3,792 million, a rise of 13.5 per cent over 1981-82.

 The greatest part of the expenditures just mentioned is in the form of 

 grants to the States for the full support of universities and CAEs, to 

 top up State Government programs for their schools and TAPE programs, 

 and to provide substantial support to non-government schools on a needs 

 basis.

 Later decisions require some revision to the June guidelines including 

 several increases in the financial allocations announced at that time.

 The revised guidelines now provide for total Commonwealth expenditure 

 on schools and tertiary education of $2,991 million (in 1982 outturn 

 prices) an increase in real terms of nearly $50 million or 1.7 per cent 

 over 1982, as follows:

 Arising from the Government's decisions on the Crawford Report of the 

 Revitalisation of Australian Shipping, an additional $1.8 million 

 ($1.6 million capital and $0.2 million recurrent) will be provided in 

 1983 for the support of ratings training at the Australian Maritime 

 College. The cost of equipment will be met from allocations already 

 determined.

 Following consideration of the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and 

 Services for Migrants conducted by the Australian Institute of Multi­

 cultural Affairs, the Government has decided that funds will be 

 transferred to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's 

 programs from other Commonwealth authorities to support language 

 instruction. A further $1.1 million will be available for advanced 

 English language instruction for migrants under the particular purpose 

 funds for the TAPE sector. In total, the Commission is asked to 

 allocate 15 per cent of all particular purpose TAPE funds for these 

 courses. An amount of $0.2 million will be made available during 

 1982-83 for the provision of cultural awareness and language courses 

 within tertiary institutions under the Commission's programs.

 Schools

 Similarly, as a consequence of decisions on the Evaluation of Post­

 Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants, the Government will be 

 providing an additional $1.6 million in 1983 to the Commonwealth 

 Schools Commission for the New Arrivals element of the English as a

 STATEMENT 3

 Second Language Program: the supplement responds to an increased

 requirement for services. The Government has also asked the Commission 

 to undertake a comprehensive research and data collection program 

 concerning the English language competence of students from non- 

 English-speaking backgrounds. When the results of a current Commission 

 survey are received, the Government will re-examine the needs of ethnic 

 schools which, under a pilot scheme, are being assisted with annual 

 grants of up to $30 per student.

 The eligibility criteria of the Special Education Program are to be 

 extended to include handicapped children below school age who require 

 early education intervention services. Funds will be provided for this 

 purpose from within existing guidelines allocations.

 There follows a broad range of Budget initiatives amongst which stand 

 out extensive adjustments to existing schemes of student assistance 

 grants, as well as an attractive loans scheme for full-time tertiary 

 students.

 STUDENT ASSISTANCE SCHEMES

 The Government has decided to make increases in allowances under all 

 student assistance schemes for 1983, and to liberalise means tests.

 The increases will achieve a marked improvement in benefits under 

 Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards, Secondary Allowances and Tertiary 

 Education Assistance and other schemes. As a result of these 

 decisions, overall expenditure on student assistance programs will rise 

 in the first full year of operation by an estimated 24 p6r cent from 

 $245 million to $303 million.

 The main features of the Government's expanded program of assistance 

 for 1983 are:

 . Postgraduate Awards - living allowance to be increased by 

 48 per cent and 100 additional new awards provided.

 STATEMENT 4

 . Secondary Allowances - benefits to be increased by 20 per 

 cent and the means test substantially liberalised.

 . Tertiary Education Assistance - living allowances to be 

 increased by 20 per cent.

 . All means-tested schemes - means tests to be liberalised 

 by 11 per cent.

 Details of increases and changes in conditions of the various schemes 

 for 1983 are as follows:

 Tertiary Education Assistance

 Living allowances at the at-home, away-from-home and independent rates 

 will be increased by 20 per cent. The maximum rates will rise to 

 $2,010 p.a. ($1,675 p.a. in 1982) and $3,100 p.a. ($2,583 p.a. in 

 1982). The marginal adjusted family income (MAPI) which attracts the 

 maximum allowances will be increased by 11 per cent from $11,034 to 

 $12,248.

 Postgraduate Awards .

 Two special measures have been applied to Postgraduate Awards as a 

 means of encouraging postgraduate research in universities and colleges 

 of advanced education. The living allowance will rise by 48 per cent 

 from $4,620 to $6,850 per annum and the number of new awards to be 

 offered will be increased from 800 to 900 per annum. A further change 

 is that from 1983, Award holders may receive up to $1,000 a year from 

 an award provided by a tertiary institution and up to $5,000 a year 

 from an award provided by the private sector without affecting the 

 allowances under their Commonwealth award (at present the limit is 

 $500).

 Adult Secondary Education Assistance

 Living allowances and the MAPI level will be increased by 11 per cent. 

 The new MAPI level will be $12,248, in line with the Tertiary Education 

 Assistance Scheme.

 STATEMENT 5

 Secondary Allowances

 Secondary allowances will be increased by 20 per cent and the MAPI 

 level by 44 per cent from $8,482 to $12,248 - the same level as for 

 Tertiary Education Assistance. Parents whose adjusted family income 

 does not exceed $12,248 will receive assistance of $871 per annum.

 These substantial increases will considerably extend the number of 

 families who will be given greater support to maintain their children 

 at school during the final two secondary years (Years 11 and 12).

 Aboriginal Secondary Grants

 Under the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme, living and boarding 

 allowances as well as allowances for books and clothing will rise by 

 11 per cent. In addition, the school and hostel boarding allowances 

 will be amalgamated with the new allowance to be paid at the school 

 rate, the higher of the two existing rates. The maximum benefit will 

 rise from $1,760 p.a. to $1,954 p.a. free of means test.

 Aboriginal Study Grants '

 Living allowances for Aboriginal Study grants will be increased by 

 11 per cent. The rate for single students over 18 will be $78 per week 

 free of means test.

 Assistance for Isolated Children

 For parents of children isolated from normal school facilities, the 

 means-test-f ree boarding and second-heme allowances will be increased 

 by 11 per cent. There will also be some rationalisation of the 

 existing Additional Boarding and Special Supplementary Allowances: 

 the two allowances will be amalgamated into one with the maximum 

 allowance being 11 per cent higher (16 per cent in the case of senior 

 secondary students) than the total of the two separate allowances in 

 1982. The new allowance will be subject to boarding costs and a means 

 test. Parents with incomes not exceeding the new level of $10,200 will 

 be able to qualify for the maximum benefit of $1,537 p.a. in the case 

 of senior secondary students. Substantial concessions in the means 

 test will now be applied to families with more than one student 

 supported under the scheme.

 STATEMENT 6

 Table 1 (Attachment A) indicates for both 1982 and 1983 the estimated 

 numbers of students to be assisted and estimated expenditure. Table 2 

 (Attachment B) lists the new scales of benefits to apply for 1983.

 The effect of the changes outlined will be to increase estimated 

 expenditure for 1983 on student assistance schemes by $58.5 million. 

 Some 12,000 additional students (7 per cent over 1982) are expected to 

 receive assistance. The changes in benefits and means-test levels will 

 do much to alleviate the burden of costs met by parents and students 

 for full-time education, and will also extend assistance to others who 

 do not at present qualify. A specific aim is that the broadening of 

 support will encourage more students to complete secondary education 

 and by further education and training, equip themselves better for the 

 world of work. The increases are indicative of the Government's 

 continuing commitment to the provision of grants for the support of 

 students.

 LOANS SCHEME FOR TERTIARY STUDENTS

 The Government, in co-operation with banks, will sponsor a loans scheme 

 to begin in 1983 as an additional source of support to students in 

 meeting their educational expenses. Legislation which is necessary for 

 the operation of the scheme will be introduced in this Session.

 Students enrolled full time in courses at tertiary institutions will be 

 able to borrow between $500 and $1,000 per year subject to total 

 borrowing of $8,000. To be eligible for a bank loan a student needs to 

 be an Australian citizen or have permanent resident status. All 

 students entitled to assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance 

 Scheme (TEAS), the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS) 

 and the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme (Abstudy) and holders of 

 Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards (CPA) will be eligible to apply for a 

 loan. Other full-time students will be eligible if they meet an income 

 test (details in supplementary papers). Overall lending limits will be 

 decided by the banks.

 STATEMENT 7

 In addition to guaranteeing each loan, the Government will subsidise by 

 5 per cent the interest rate charged by the banks. Currently a student 

 would be required to pay interest at 9.5 per cent. Students will not 

 be required to make repayments while studying and for up to two years 

 after completing or discontinuing their full-time studies to enable 

 them to become established in a job. Up to ten years will be allowed 

 bo complete repayments.

 The Government has demonstrated its continuing commitment to TEAS and 

 other student assistance schemes. The loans scheme should be welcomed 

 by many students. More details of the scheme will be announced after 

 further discussions with banks. State authorities and institutions. 

 Application forms are expected to be available towards the end of this 

 year.

 TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK

 The 1982-83 Budget provides $43.3 million ($34.4 million in 1981-82) 

 for transition programs including education programs for unemployed 

 youth (EPUY). Of this amount $42.0 million will be for the States and 

 the Northern Territory, $0.9 million for the Australian Capital 

 Territory and $0.4 million for national projects and evaluation.

 Under the Transition from School to Work Program itself, the 

 Commonwealth is providing funds over the five-year period 1980-84 to 

 improve education and training opportunities for young people in the 

 age group 15-19 years who may be experiencing difficulties in making 

 the transition to working life. The Commonwealth's contribution was 

 $16 million in 1980, $27.4 million in 1981 and is $30 million in 1982. 

 EPUY programs in 1982 cost a further $4.6 million.

 We expect the States to continue to maintain their own efforts in 

 transition education.

 In the two and a half years since its introduction the Transition 

 Program has made a substantial contribution to the development of 

 alternative courses and curricula in schools and transition courses in

 STATEMENT 8

 TAPE colleges. It has extended and improved careers guidance and 

 education, and work experience programs and contributed to teacher 

 development relevant to the transition needs of young people. The 

 level of awareness among teachers, parents, employers and local 

 communities about transition objectives and difficulties faced by young 

 people has been heightened. The Program is strengthening the 

 understanding and co-operation between Education and Labour Departments 

 at both Commonwealth and State level.

 CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES

 Whilst the Curriculum Development Centre itself has been wound down, 

 significant provision is made in the appropriations of the Department 

 of Education for a number of important activities.

 A major continuing commitment is the production of instructional 

 materials for schools in English as a second language for which the 

 budget has been increased to $800,000 in 1982-83. An additional amount 

 of $300,000 is provided to support curriculum projects in areas of 

 national importance especially Aboriginal and multicultural education.

 Furthermore, the States have indicated their interest in participating 

 in joint curriculum projects.

 EDUCATIONAL USE OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY

 The Commonwealth will provide $0.1 million in the current financial 

 year towards research into the use of communications technology in 

 education. A program of trials will be commenced which will assist 

 education authorities and institutions in making decisions on 

 educational use of the domestic communications satellite. The 

 satellite will commence operating in 1985. ;  N

 The funds are to match, on a dollar for dollar basis, contributions by 

 the States and the Northern Territory. The joint funding will meet the 

 cost of the trials and administration and evaluation of the program.

 An advisory committee, including Commonwealth, yState and Territory

 STATEMENT 9

 representatives will be established to recommend projects for funding. 

 The aim is to develop a balanced program of trials relevant to all 

 levels of education.

 EDUCATION IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY

 Funds being provided for the ACT Schools Authority for government 

 schools and pre-schools will total $107.0 million, an increase of 

 12.5 per cent compared with 1981-82. An additional $4.2 million is 

 being allocated for schools capital works. The funds being provided 

 will allow school services to be extended in the Tuggeranong Valley.

 In a context where government school enrolments in the ACT have, 

 broadly speaking, stabilised, the level of funds will enable school 

 services to be maintained at the current levels.

 Recurrent funds for ACT non-government schools will total $22.5 million 

 in 1982-83 compared with $15.1 million in 1981-82. Most of this 

 increase is accounted for by a change in the timing of the payment of 

 grants which has transferred the payment of some funds from 1981-82 

 into the present financial year.

 In addition to the meeting of existing commitments under the previous 

 capital aid program, the sum of $1,216 million will be provided for 

 capital funding of new non-government schools projects. This compares 

 with $1.13 million in 1981-82, and will support the construction of two 

 new-schools and expanded facilities in several existing schools. One 

 of the two new schools to be constructed will be a co-educational 

 Anglican secondary school.

 Recurrent funds being provided for further education in the ACT will 

 rise by 13.3 per cent to $24.2 million. Expenditure on plant and 

 equipment will be $869,000, an increase of 21.9 per cent. Funding will 

 allow the continued development of the Woden TAPE College, which is now 

 in its second year of operation, and for furnishing a new Central 

 Services building at the Canberra TAFE College. It is expected that 

 enrolments in ACT further education institutions will be approximately 

 23,300 in 1983 compared with 22,000 in 1982.
