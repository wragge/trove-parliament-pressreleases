 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA, 17TH OF FEBRUARY 2002.

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Death of an Australian soldier, ‘Kids Overboard’ photos and the Governor-General. 

 CREAN: My deepest sympathies go out to the family of the SAS soldier killed in action in Afghanistan. This incident together, with the one that saw an Australian soldier maimed by a land mine, shoots home so quickly, the horror of war and in particular the impact on the family. Australia as a whole has joined the ‘War on Terror’ but it’s the families that bear the greatest burden. So our thoughts are with the parents today and our prayers are with the rest of the soldiers on active duty for the ‘War on Terrorism’.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean have you been given any further details about the soldier’s personal status and personal information?

 CREAN: I haven’t, no. Obviously we will get that advice at the appropriate time but I think that really the issue here is the thoughts for the family. It must be terrible for them.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean do you know whether the photos that you released to Channel Nine this morning were available to the Government before November the 10th?

 CREAN: That’s a question you need to direct to the Government. We believe the photos were available to the Government. They need to answer that question but what we do know is that the photos that we’ve received are in a series of files. The ones that we have released were contained in the same file titled ‘Sinking’ from which the Government drew the two that it released publicly. So if it had access to the two on the file one assumes it had access to the full file. The issue here with the Government is they chose to release only two of them. Why didn’t they choose to release the rest which clearly put a context and a date on the circumstances? Yet they used the photos to justify their allegation that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard the day before when the photos were clearly of the

 2

 next day and whilst there were children in the water they were in the water essentially because the boat was sinking and it was the Navy that had gone to their assistance. The Navy was doing everything to help them because they were in some distress.

 JOURNALIST: The Prime Minister said just a short time ago that he has it in writing from the acting Chief of the ADF that in fact the only two photos that were sent to Reith’s Department at the time were the two that they released. Does that get him off the hook, or get the Government off the hook?

 CREAN: No I don’t believe so. You’ve got to look at the circumstances in which only those two were sent. What was the request made? Why wouldn’t the Navy want to send all of them particularly when the Navy had been saying ‘we know’ from the 10th of October that there was no evidence of ‘Kids Overboard’. Now if these photos were released by Minister Reith that day and his office was told just before he went on to talk about this being the justification for the incident then clearly the Navy was doing all it could to warn the Government that their claims were not justified by the facts. If in fact that’s the Government’s assertion then they’re up to their tricky defences again. Today we heard Phillip Ruddock say that they got oral advice about the lie but didn’t get written confirmation that the lie was wrong. So in other words they relied on oral advice to perpetrate the lie but oral advice that contradicted the lie wasn’t sufficient. This redefines the concept of core and non-core promises. We’ve now got a Government that will be making oral promises and written promises. Watch out for them. Get them in writing in the future. This is a Government that’ll stop at nothing to save its hide.

 JOURNALIST: Do these latest revelations strengthen the case to call Mr Reith before the Senate Select Committee looking into these matters?

 CREAN: Well it’s a question for the Senate as to who it calls, not for me. I believe it’s in everyone’s interests that former Minister Reith appears. He’s got a lot of explaining to do, but that’s the matter for the Senate. Let’s wait and see what happens. There’s opportunity next week in the Senate Estimates to get some, I think, important clarifications. Let’s hope we can make some headway next week and the inquiry when it commences in the middle of the week.

 JOURNALIST: Where did you get the photos from?

 CREAN: Well we obtained it from sources. I’m not going to go into that. I’m simply making the point that I heard that the Prime Minister today that he would investigate as to whether all the photos should be put out. Well they are and they tell a story where the Government selectively used photos that did not tell the true story. That’s the issue here, it’s not a question of where they came from. The Government had access to these

 3

 photos. They chose to selectively use them. They didn’t tell the truth and they’ve been covering up ever since.

 JOURNALIST: The report, Mr Crean, indicates that only two photographs were sent from HMAS Adelaide. Can you be clear about what you’re suggesting here? Are you saying that specifically those photographs were requested?

 CREAN: I ‘m saying that if that was the request they

 requested them to demonstrate justification for their story. The photos that were available didn’t justify the story. So the Government was into using photographs falsely to assert what they never demonstrated.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean does the Governor-General have some explaining to do?

 CREAN: I think it’s very important for the Governor General

 to explain his side of these latest revelations, not just in the newspaper but on television today. They are serious allegations and I think unless he does explain his side of the story it will diminish the Office of Governor-General. I’ve had the opportunity to speak with the Governor-General previously and I’m satisfied that he genuinely wants to clear up this issue. Well I think it’s terribly important that in the circumstances of these new revelations that he be given that opportunity, but he should do it quickly.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think he can survive in that office with the odium of these allegations that have been raised today?

 CREAN: I’m not going to be drawn on the judgement on

 that, I’ve made the point I think it’s appropriate for him to explain his side. I called for that on the previous occasion I think it’s appropriate on this occasion and I hope that his explanation is forthcoming and quickly.

 JOURNALIST: When you say quickly do you mean in the next twenty-four, forty-eight hours, or this week?

 CREAN: Again I think everyone knows that it’s in

 everyone’s interests that this be clarified, explained, whatever is needed as quickly as possibly. It’s in the hands of the Governor-General. I’m more than happy to allow that judgement to be with him. I hope he makes the right response and comes forward quickly.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean just back to the boat people affair. Is the fact that you were able to get a hold of these photographs and from my understanding it’s a very big file so there’s a lot of photographs.

 CREAN: Yes.

 JOURNALIST: Does that indicate to you that there are people within the military who are pretty ticked off with what’s going on?

 CREAN: I think that it could show that but I think that

 there’s plenty of evidence around in the newspapers that people in Defence think they’re being set up to be the patsies in this game. I think that if you look at the photos you can see that the Navy went out of its way to help people in distress and there was a lot warmth in a number of these photos between the Naval officer and the people that they rescued. But I think if you look at the newspaper reports there clearly is a frustration in the Navy and the Armed Forces generally that they desperately tried to get the Government to know that there was no evidence to justify the continuing assertion of claims by the Government but it fell on deaf ears. Now in those circumstances I think a Government trying to fit up either Minister Reith or the Defence Department with the excuse is trying avoid themselves accepting responsibility. But let’s wait and see what comes out of the inquiry.

 JOURNALIST: How far can the inquiry get without access to military personnel?

 CREAN: Well it’s going to get access to military personnel

 because as I understand the Prime Minster on Friday after I challenged him to he said there’s going to be no gag on officials presenting to the inquiry. Let’s wait and see how the inquiry progresses.

 JOURNALIST: This morning I think he said relevant public servants, as opposed to senior public servants. Are you concerned that some of the Departmental Secretaries for instance might not be, may be restricted from appearing?

 CREAN: Do you suggest he’s back flipping, Steve? I’m

 happy to accept at the moment that the Prime Minister has said that everyone can go that’s called and that they should all tell the truth. They are the appropriate criteria. Let the inquiry begin.

 JOURNALIST: And that includes Ministerial staff and staff from the Prime Minster’s own office?

 CREAN: I think it’s again the question of who the Senate

 inquiry determines to call. That’s a matter for them, but clearly it’s in our interests to get to the bottom of this to get the truth. We’ve had nothing but deceit so far. It’s about time we got the truth.
