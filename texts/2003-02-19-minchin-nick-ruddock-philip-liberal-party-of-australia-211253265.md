 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 

 Re-Tender For Christmas Island Immigration Centre 

 Joint Media Release with Minister for Finance and  Administration, Senator Nick Minchin 

 MPS 9/2003 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous  Affairs, Philip Ruddock and the Minister for Finance and  Administration, Senator Nick Minchin today announced the re-tendering of the contract for the construction of the Christmas  Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. 

 The success of the Government's policy has meant no unauthorised  boat arrivals since December 2001. This is a remarkable  achievement given that some 1515 people arrived in the first three  weeks of August 2001 alone. 

 It has afforded the Government the opportunity to review the size  and scope of the proposed Christmas Island facility. 

 The proposed 1,200 person purpose-designed and built facility will  be scaled down to 800 places. This will comprise both purpose-designed and built places, along with contingency places. 

 The Government remains committed to the construction of the  detention facility on Christmas Island but the timing imperative,  which involved a truncated tender process, is no longer critical,  because of the reduction in boat arrivals. 

 In light of the less urgent timeline for completion of the facility and  the reduced scope of works, the current construction contract with  the Walter Construction Group (WCG) will be terminated. 

 The project will be re-tendered by the Department of Finance and  Administration under a more traditional delivery methodology  involving fixed price tenders based on a detailed and developed  design to meet specifications from the Department of Immigration  and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. 

 The Walter Construction Group will be invited to tender for the  revised project 

 Considerable work has already been successfully carried out by  Walters Construction on Christmas Island in support of the  construction of the facility and detention operations. Staff housing is 

 in place and is being used already including in support of the  detention operations at the existing temporary facility at Phosphate  Hill. Site works are substantially progressed.  

 The facility will not be completed in 2003. Its timing will be subject  to the tender process and responses received from the market. 

 The Minister for Finance will be announcing details of the new  tender arrangements in due course.
