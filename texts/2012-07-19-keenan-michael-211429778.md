 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling SMUGGLERS RUNNING TWICE DAILY  SERVICE AS BOOM CONTINUES UNDER  LABOR July 19, 2012

 The arrival of another illegal boat, with 25 people on board, is the eighth to arrive in four days as people smugglers run a twice  daily  service  under  Labor’s  failure  and  inaction  on  border  protection,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "The  people  smuggling  boom  under  Labor's  border  failures,  which  is  now  seeing  a  twice  daily  service  to  Australia,  will leave  Australian  taxpayers  with  the  consequences  as  boat  arrivals  smash  the  government’s  budget  estimate  of  450   people a month," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Already this month 16 boats with 913 people on board have arrived, more than double Labor’s monthly estimate with 12  days still to go. 

 "Since last year’s MYEFO the government’s forecast of 450 arrivals has been blown out in six of seven months including by almost four times in June and almost three times in May. 

 "Labor can resove this by immediately restoring the Coalition's proven policies they abolished, not waiting for a committee that they are already trying to distance themselves from by reserving their position on its recommendations," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "Eight boats in four days have arrived as the people smugglers continue to take advantage of a Labor Government that has lost any semblance of control of our borders. 

 "By refusing  to  reinstate the Coalition’s successful  border protection policies, the Gillard  Labor Government are  placing untold strain on our premier border agency Border Protection Command (BPC) as they simply do not have the resources to deal with this extraordinary influx of arrivals. 

 "In  this  brand  new  financial  year  of  2012/13  we  have  already  seen  16  illegal  boats  carrying  913  people  arrive  on  our shores, a sure indication that the people smugglers are laughing all the way to the bank while Labor leaves our borders open and vulnerable. 

 "It would seem that this financial year will not be any easier on our hardworking men and women of BPC â the least this  Gillard Labor Government could do is ensure they are properly resourced to handle this incessant flood of arrivals," Mr  Keenan said.
