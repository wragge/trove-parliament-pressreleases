 Media Release    Adam Bandt MP  Federal Member for Melbourne    Government ‘has a go’ at cheap medicine for Melbourne’s poorest    A Budget measure to strip funds from Australia’s only communityâfunded pharmacy is an ideologically  driven attack on Melbourne’s pensioners and poor.    The changes will have a big impact on a communityâfunded pharmacy, coHealth, that operates in the  electorate of Melbourne and that saves the government money while servicing some of the city’s  poorest people.    The community pharmacy model is a long standing successful alternative that should be expanded, not  shut down in the drive for a uniform profit driven health sector.    This change will deliver no budget savings. In fact, it will end up costing the tax payer money due to  worse health outcomes.    cohealth is based in Collingwood, has operated for 20 years and is a notâforâprofit pharmacy that  services people on low incomes, including Melbourne’s housing commission residents.    Quotes attributable to Greens MP Adam Bandt:    “This is indeed a ‘have a go’ Budget. Tony Abbott is having a go at Melbourne’s pensioners and poor,  who need affordable medicine.”    “This is a shameful decision which fails the fairness test and will cost the taxpayer money.”    “The Abbott government is closing down Australia’s cheapest pharmacy at a hefty cost to the taxpayer,  pensioners and the poor.”    “The government may need legislation to make this change and we will be campaigning for Labor and  the crossbench to save cohealth should it come before the Parliament.”    Media contact: Adam Pulford, 0429 109 054    A copy of cohealth’s media statement is attached.

 MEDIA STATEMENT 

 

 

 AUSTRALIA’S CHEAPEST PHARMACY SET TO CLOSE - BUDGET 2015            13  May,  2015  

 

 Australia’s only community-funded pharmacy that’s been saving the Federal Government money  whilst servicing Melbourne’s poorest communities will be axed by the 2015 Budget.    

 cohealth Chief Executive Lyn Morgain said it was unbelievable and unfair that cohealth’s  integrated patient care model, which delivers prescriptions at 30% less cost than the national  average, was to be cut.   

 “It seems extraordinary to withdraw funding from a service that is delivering on the government’s  policy objectives”, Ms Morgain said.    

 “Given government investigations into runaway spending on pharmaceuticals and the recent  Mental Health Review recommendation that pharmacists be better be linked with GPs, this  decision flies in the face of efforts to streamline health care costs.    

 “There’s no question that we are delivering a cheaper version of health care for the government  to some of the sickest people in our community, and our GPs say the overall quality of care is  better for their patients.   

 “We’re astonished that we’ve had no consultation with the government on this policy decision.”    

 “Our community-driven, not-for-profit model follows international best practice and we invite the  Health Minister to view it as a way to address skyrocketing health care costs.   

 “Out of the Mental Health Review, the Australian Medical Association and the Pharmaceutical  Society of Australia have already begun working on a model for pharmacists to work in GP clinics.  cohealth already offers such a model and it’s operated successfully for 20 years.   

 Last year Australia had 190,000 preventable hospital admissions because of incorrect  pharmaceuticals issues, costing the system $660 million.    

 “We are operating a streamlined, one-stop, integrated doctor/pharmacy service in the one  building - it ticks the box for efficient service delivery, good medication management, and leads  to better health outcomes and cheaper health care.   

 “For example, cohealth GPs see many people speaking languages other than English. With the  pharmacy onsite, interpreters assisting the patient with their medical appointment can also ensure  people understand and comply with their medications.   

 “One of the main reasons older people get admitted to hospital is problems with their medication.    

 “Because our doctors and pharmacists are in the same building and share the medical records,  collaboration on individual patient cases improves care.    

 cohealth is a leading provider of community health services across Melbourne’s western, northern and inner suburbs. We provide  medical, dental, allied health, mental health and specialist health services, and are engaged in the community to improve the health  and connectedness of some of Melbourne’s most vulnerable populations including refugee, homeless, Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islanders, women experiencing violence and people with a mental illness.

 The cohealth community pharmacy, which delivered 24,660 prescriptions last year, demonstrated  lower rates of antibiotic, hypnotics like temazepan, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories use than  national averages.   

 Dr Kate Coles, a GP at cohealth, said the benefit for co-located health care was clear.   

 “In this model, the pharmacist and I share medical records and talk to each other about patient  care.   

 “We quickly pick up on issues with people’s medication - issues such as over prescription, possible  cheaper medicines, or if there are any interactions between  medicines prescribed”,  Dr Coles  said.   

 “This keeps people out of hospital, and makes  their medicines safer.   

 Ms Morgain invited the Health Minister, who has shown a willingness to consult with medical  practitioners, to look at how the community health care sector could be a partner in addressing  skyrocketing rates of prescribing for mental, aged care and chronic illnesses.   

 “This community pharmacy model should be rolled out, not wrapped up”, Ms Morgain said.    

 “cohealth stands ready to work with governments to respond with solutions so that sick people do  not bear the brunt of poor decision-making, and the community benefits with fairer, cheaper,  higher quality health care.   

 

 FEDERAL BUDGET 2015   Ceasing the Alternative Arrangement Transfer to Pharmaceutical Benefits Programme   The Government will cease the Alternative Arrangement Transfer to Pharmaceutical Benefits  Programme which funds Cohealth Ltd (Cohealth) to provide Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  (PBS) medicines and pharmacy services to their clients in inner Melbourne.
