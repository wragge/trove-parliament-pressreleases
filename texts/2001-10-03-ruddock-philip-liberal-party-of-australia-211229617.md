 Minister asks Perth about Managing Migration

 MPS 173/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, will ask residents of Perth their views on the size and composition of the 2002-2003 Australian migration and humanitarian programs today.

 "The consultations will give residents of Perth the opportunity to have their say on Australia's migrant intake for the coming financial year," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I look forward to meeting with people to hear their views. I particularly look forward to discussing Perth's intake of skilled migrants," he said.

 Perth, and other areas in Western Australia, attracts around 20 percent of skilled migrants arriving in Australia.

 States and Territories can influence the level and composition of skilled and business migrants settling within their jurisdictions by using State/Territory specific and regional migration initiatives.

 "In 2000-01, there were 288 visas granted to migrants coming to Western Australia under these initiatives. That's 15 percent more than the previous year," Mr Ruddock said.

 These initiatives include the Regional Established Business in Australia category where an applicant can establish a business in a designated area. In addition, people living in these areas can sponsor a skilled relative.

 "I have recently expanded the list of designated areas in Western Australia so that only metropolitan Perth is excluded," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister launched his annual consultations in Sydney last month and will hold meetings with State, Territory and local governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare organisations, refugee agencies, and representatives of Australia's migrant communities.

 The consultation process includes:

 a discussion paper raising issues on the size and composition of Australia's Migration and Humanitarian Programs; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a range of public meetings in capital cities and regional centres including Ballina, Kalgoorlie, Townsville, Launceston and Mt Gambier; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 written submissions from the Australian community; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 discussion on migration issues on an on-line discussion forum. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "The meetings provide an ideal forum for all Australians to contribute their ideas and provides the Government with community views on issues regarding refugee resettlement and other humanitarian and general migration issues," Mr Ruddock said.
