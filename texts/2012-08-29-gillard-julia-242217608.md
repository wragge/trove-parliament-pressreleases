 PRIME MINISTER  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION   

 AUSTRALIA SIGNS MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH NAURU   

 Australia and Nauru have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the  establishment of a regional processing centre in Nauru, Prime Minister Julia Gillard  and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Chris Bowen announced today.   

 The MOU was signed in Rarotonga earlier today by Australia’s Parliamentary  Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and for Foreign Affairs Richard Marles and the  Nauru Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Kieren Keke.   

 The MOU is the next step in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel  on Asylum Seekers and an important development in setting up the regional  processing centre for irregular maritime arrivals in Nauru.   

 The signing today formalises this arrangement between Australia and Nauru.   

 The Government is committed to working in partnership with Nauru to establish a  regional processing centre at the earliest opportunity.   

 This MoU sends a clear message that countries in this region are working together  towards a lasting regional response in taking action necessary to undermine people  smuggling networks, stop those dangerous boat journeys and prevent the loss of life  at sea.   

 It also reaffirms the commitment of both countries to the Refugee Convention, with  people to be treated with dignity and respect in line with human rights standards.   

 The Government is committed to implementing the expert panel’s key principle  related to a strategic, comprehensive and integrated policy approach that provides  no advantage to people considering risking their lives on dangerous boat journeys.   

 Defence personnel are continuing work on temporary accommodation on Nauru and  the Government is progressing arrangements on a number of fronts including  contracting service providers and sourcing supplies.

 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF NAURU  AND THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, RELATING TO THE TRANSFER  TO AND ASSESSMENT OF PERSONS IN NAURU, AND RELATED ISSUES  

 

 The Republic of Nauru and the Commonwealth of Australia (‘the Participants’), wishing to  strengthen their friendly relations, have come to the following Memorandum of Understanding  (the MOU) in relation to the assessment in Nauru of certain persons, and related issues. 

 Preamble 

 Noting that:  

 â¢ The Participants are State parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of  Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and acknowledge the importance of inter-country  cooperation to undermine the People Smuggling industry; 

 â¢ The Participants share a long-standing and close bilateral relationship;  

 â¢ Irregular Migration is a continuing challenge for the Asia-Pacific region; 

 â¢ While border control and law enforcement measures are important, practical cooperative  solutions that also address humanitarian needs are required; and 

 â¢ The Commonwealth of Australia appreciates the acceptance by the Republic of Nauru  of the request made by the Commonwealth of Australia to host a Regional Processing  Centre for Asylum Seekers. 

 Recalling that:  

 â¢ At the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Bali Process on People Smuggling,  Trafficking and Related Transnational Crime (the MCBP) held in Indonesia on   29-30 March 2011, Ministers agreed: 

 â’ to a regional cooperation framework that would provide a more effective way for  interested states to cooperate to reduce Irregular Migration in the region;  â’ that the framework would be operationalised through arrangements entered into  between interested participating states on a bilateral or sub-regional basis (noting 

 the cooperation that might be available from relevant international organisations  regarding implementation);   â’ that those arrangements would be consistent with the core principles at paragraph  16 and guided by the considerations set out in paragraph 19 of the MCBP Co-

 Chairs’ Statement;  â’ that any arrangements should seek to undermine the People Smuggling model and  create disincentives for irregular travel, including through possible transfer and 

 readmission arrangements in appropriate circumstances; and  â’ that due to the large scale of irregular movement it would be appropriate to focus  arrangements on a selected caseload or caseloads.

 â¢ the need to ensure, so far as is possible, that no benefit is gained through circumventing  regular migration arrangements;
