 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 INVESTIGATION OF FAYSAL AHMED’S DEATH     

 On 24 December 2016, 27 year old Sudanese refugee Mr Faysal Ishak Ahmed sadly  passed away at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital.    

 Mr Ahmed was being held in immigration detention at the Manus Regional Processing  Centre.    

 A statement from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said Mr Ahmed  had been taken to the International Health and Medical Services Clinic on Manus Island  for treatment, following injuries suffered after a fall and seizure and had been air-lifted to  Australia for urgent medical care.    

 I have written to the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References  Committee, Senator Louise Pratt, asking the Committee to investigate the  circumstances, treatment, processes and procedures surrounding Mr Ahmed’s death as  part of the Committee’s inquiry - Serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of  asylum seekers in relation to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, and any like  allegations in relation to the Manus Regional Processing Centre.    

 Given media reports suggesting asylum seekers on Manus Island had requested better  medical treatment for Mr Ahmed and ongoing reporting of alleged neglect, abuse and  self-harm at the Centre, I believe this matter falls within Committee’s remit.     

 This inquiry was established to investigate matters of this nature following the release of  the Nauru Files and the reporting timeframe of 30 March 2017 provides a suitable  window that will allow for a thorough investigation of Mr Ahmed’s death.
