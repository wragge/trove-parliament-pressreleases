 Government’s Review Must Consider Failure Of Mandatory Detention  

 The Government is right to initiate a review into the use of tear-gas to quell protests  on Christmas Island, but this review should be as wide ranging as possible and  consider the failure of the mandatory detention policy to look after vulnerable asylum  seekers, including children, said the Australian Greens. 

 “There are so many unanswered questions flowing from this weekend’s events. Who  authorised this use of force against asylum seekers? Was the Minister aware that  this action was going to be taken? What possible justification can be provided for this  use of force?  What exactly happened on Christmas Island between Friday night and  Monday morning? The Minister has confirmed the use of tear-gas, but there are  mixed reports about whether rubber bullets were fired - the Minister needs to clarify  this.  All of these matters need to be on the table as part of this review,” said the  Greens’ Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.  

 “These kind of incidents underscore the terrible problems with the Government’s  mandatory detention policy. Here you have vulnerable people who have fled torture  and persecution, being exposed to things that would only serve to compound their  trauma. Unfortunately, these weekend’s events are part of a broader problem.” 

 “The Government needs to go further through this review process and consider the  appropriateness of its mandatory detention policy as a whole. What impact is it  having on the health and wellbeing of asylum seekers, particularly children? Unless 

 the Government asks these questions and acts on the advice received, tensions  within immigration detention centres will only continue to rise.”
