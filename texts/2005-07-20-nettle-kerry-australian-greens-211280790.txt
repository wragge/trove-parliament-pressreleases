 Greens call on Macquarie University Vice Chancellor  to examine record of racist academic: Urge Minister  to support multicultural community 

 20th Jul 2005 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today wrote to the vice chancellor of Macquarie  University Di Yerbury requesting an urgent review of the teaching and  assessment history of Associate Professor Andrew Fraser who has made  public his deeply racist views regarding Asians and Africans in Australia. 

 

 Mr Fraser's racist views featured both on national television and in  metropolitan newspapers this week.   

 "The views of Professor Fraser are as abhorrent as they are ridiculous. The  university has an obligation to ensure that these views are not affecting his  teaching or assessment of students," Senator Nettle said.   

 "Today I have spoken to the Horn or Africa Relief and Development Agency  that assists immigrants from the Horn of Africa in Australia and they have  expressed concern for the welfare of African and Asian students in Associate  Professor Fraser's classes.   

 "It's important that when dangerous racist views are aired publicly the  government is quick to repudiate them. To this end I have contacted  Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone's office this morning and urged her  to publicly condemn Mr Fraser's comments.   

 "It's particularly upsetting that refugees who have come to Australia fleeing  racial and religious persecution should have to put up with racism in their  new home.   

 "The Greens celebrate the multicultural nature of Australia and welcome the  cultural wealth it brings.   

 "The Greens are confident that the overwhelming majority of Australians  support our proud multicultural tradition and join us in condemning racism in  all its forms."
