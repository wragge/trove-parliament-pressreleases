 KEVIN RUDD M.P.   

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and  International Security   

 DOORSTOP  INTERVIEW - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA   

 30 MARCH 2006   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 

 Subjects:   Terms of reference of the Cole Inquiry; Indonesian cartoon   

 

 RUDD:    John Howard has been caught out with a Cole Inquiry which  he designed as little more than a cover-up: a cover-up with rorted terms of  reference. What is John Howard’s motive in this? It is very simple. He wants to  protect the political bacon of Alexander Downer. Alexander Downer’s credibility  has already been cut to shreds through the evidence that has been produced so  far.   

 So John Howard’s political motive is: how to protect Alexander Downer, how to  protect Mark Vaile, neither of whom have covered themselves in glory in this  $300 million dollar wheat for weapons scandal in recent months.   

 John Howard said on television last night that he would like to know how this  scandal came about. Well if the Prime Minister really wants to know how this  scandal came about, why doesn’t he ask Commissioner Cole that very question?  If the Prime Minister wants to find out whether his Ministers performed their job  or not, why doesn’t he ask Commissioner Cole that very question? And of course  that is where our fearless Prime Minister’s courage collapses in a heap because  he doesn’t want to ask Commissioner Cole that question because he is frightened  about what the answer will be.   

 John Howard’s simple challenge is this to give Commissioner Cole proper  powers to make conclusions and findings about whether or not his Ministers  have done their job under Australian law. That is the challenge and John  Howard is running away from it a million miles an hour.   

 To conclude on this, John Howard, by rorting the terms of reference, is turning  the Cole Inquiry into a stitch up and a cover up.   

 REPORTER:  Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister says from the February  statement from Commissioner Cole that he will look into what the  Commonwealth knew, what the Government knew, including Ministers and he  says that it will be obvious when the findings are handed down whether or not  Ministers have been in breach of their international obligations or in breach of  Australian regulations? Isn’t that a fair point?   

 RUDD:  John Howard is playing word games with that. He knows  that there are two huge holes in that argument. He knows that Commissioner  Cole can only make findings about facts concerning the Commonwealth insofar  as it relates to the Commissioner’s powers to conclude whether or not the AWB  has breached criminal law or not. That is the first big hole in it. And the second  big hole is this: Commissioner Cole was given no powers whatsoever to draw  together those findings of fact into a conclusion about whether or not Ministers  have done their job. It is very simple to see what the Prime Minister is up to here.  If you ask a simple question, which is why not give Commissioner Cole the  power to reach conclusions about whether his Ministers have done their job or  not in enforcing UN sanctions as required under Australian law, any reasonable  person would say yes. But not John Howard, whose entire strategy for  government is one of spin doctoring and cover-up.    

 REPORTER:  But if Commissioner Cole finds that Government Ministers  knew what was going on, doesn’t it stand to reason then that they weren’t doing  their job?   

 RUDD:  John Howard knows full well that the findings of fact which  the Commissioner will make will not be drawn together in a conclusion about  whether or not Ministers did their job under the law?   

 REPORER:   You will do that though won’t you?   

 RUDD:  John Howard’s perfect outcome here is to have a series of  facts delivered in the Cole Inquiry which John Howard can interpret as John  Howard wishes. John Howard doesn’t want to have that interpretation done by  Commissioner Cole. That is the core point here. That is the absolute core point.    

 John Howard wants a series of factual findings concerning what his Ministers  may or may not have done. He doesn’t want any conclusions reached by  Commissioner Cole because John Howard wants to do the interpreting and reach  conclusions himself, because then it becomes a matter of subjective political 

 debate. What John Howard fears most of all is an objective conclusion by  Commissioner Cole, because once that objective conclusion is made, Alexander  Downer would have nowhere to go but out the back door.  

 

 REPORTER:  But John Howard would have a pretty hard time explaining  away though if Commissioner Cole found that his Ministers knew what was  going on?   

 RUDD:   John Howard is capable of explaining himself out of any  situation at any time by deploying the word games that he has learned in politics  over the last 10 years of being Prime Minister. You know that as well as I do. He  has done that with Children Overboard, he has done it with pre-war intelligence  on Iraq when he didn’t tell the truth to the Australian people, he has done it with  the Cornelia Rau affair and he will try and do it again.   

 John Howard’s perfect outcome is to have a series of findings of fact which do  not add up to or haven’t been drawn together into a conclusion by the  Commissioner. That is what John Howard wants as an outcome. That is why this  has been rorted from the outset as a stitch up and a cover up because John  Howard wants to preserve the political bacon of Alexander Downer.   

 REPORTER:  Mr Rudd, an Indonesian newspaper has published a cartoon  of John Howard and Alexander Downer as dingoes in a compromising position.  How do you view this? Do you think that it is a new low in the Papuan asylum  situation? 

 

 RUDD:   I have seen that report this morning. If that report is true,  well then that depiction I think is disgusting and disgraceful.   

 Ends. 30 March 2006
