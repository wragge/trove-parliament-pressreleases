 AMEP teaching materials show a flair for  excellence 

 Tuesday, 24 July 2008 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services, Laurie Ferguson, has welcomed the shortlist of an  innovative and interactive Get Wise module in this year’s  Australian Awards for Excellence in Educational Publishing. 

 ‘The shortlisting is for Your Money, a module from the Get Wise  series published by the National Centre for English Language  Teaching and Research [NCELTR],’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 ‘The Department of Immigration and Citizenship [DIAC], through  the Adult Migrant English Program [AMEP] Research Centre, has  worked with NCELTR on a range of projects in the past, and is  very pleased to congratulate them on this notable shortlisting.’ 

 Get Wise was launched by the parliamentary secretary in April  2008 and includes six modules specifically designed to help young  AMEP students (aged 16-25) build English skills while learning  practical lessons about looking after themselves in Australia. 

 ‘Each Get Wise module includes a workbook, DVD and audio  CDs. The Your Money module is interactive, with a snakes-and-ladders style board game that rewards strong financial decisions,’  Mr Ferguson said.  

 Your Money, authored by Maureen Hague and Clare Harris, has  been shortlisted for the vocational education teaching and learning  section of the awards.   

 The entries are judged on clarity of writing, pedagogical  implications, illustrations, special features and characteristics,  quality of subject matter, innovation and flair. Winners will be  announced in Sydney on August 7. These awards were  established in 1994 and are prestigious in their field. 

 Mr Ferguson initially introduced the Get Wise materials in April,  amid media coverage drawing attention to the problems  associated with lending to new refugees who have little  understanding of Australia’s financial system.  

 ‘It is hoped that the Get Wise module, Your Money, may address  some of these issues by providing a valuable first step to sound  financial knowledge,’ the parliamentary secretary said. 

 Mr Ferguson said he was impressed by the enthusiasm of the  authors and the AMEP practitioners at the April launch.  ‘The  shortlisting is an exciting bonus that substantiates the  department’s efforts to meet clients’ needs in an appropriate and  useful manner,’ he said.
