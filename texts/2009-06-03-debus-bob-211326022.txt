 BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES FOCUS OF INDONESIAN VISIT 

 The Minister for Home Affairs Bob Debus will outline the Australian Government’s  strengthened border protection measures announced in the 2009-10 Budget when he leads a  senior Australian Government delegation to Indonesia today. 

 Members of the high-level delegation, which includes the National Security Adviser Duncan  Lewis and People Smuggling Ambassador Michael Potts, will meet the Minister for Law and  Human Rights Andi Mattalatta and other Indonesian Government ministers during the June  3-4 visit. 

 Mr Debus said the focus of the visit was to inform the Indonesian Government how an  additional $654 million in Budget funding will be used to combat people smuggling and  stabilise displaced populations in the region. 

 “Our strengthened border security measures will enable us to identify people smugglers,  intercept people smuggling ventures and prosecute people smugglers. 

 At the same time, we will work to stabilise displaced populations and reduce incentives for  people to engage criminals who prey on their vulnerabilities.” 

 Mr Debus said the strong relationship between Australia and Indonesia was crucial for the  effective management of irregular migration in the region and again thanked Indonesia for its  cooperation in the recent extradition of alleged people smuggler Hadi Ahmadi. 

 “Recent boat arrivals to Australia and other countries in our region demonstrate that we are  not immune from the conflicts and insecurity that is driving this global spike. 

 People smugglers remain active and willing to exploit the displaced and vulnerable.” 

 “The Indonesian Government’s ongoing assistance in the Ahmadi matter shows we are both  committed to the fight against people smugglers. 

 This bilateral cooperation demonstrates the strength of the Lombok Treaty and the broader  cooperation of the Bali Process.”
