 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE 

 DATE:   23 October 2007 

 TITLE:   Doorstop  -  Visit  to  Page,  refugees,  Garuda  Airlines  Crash  Investigation,  David   Hicks, climate change. 

 

 MR DOWNER: I’m delighted to be in Page, in Lismore, with Chris Gulaptis, the  National Party candidate. I think he’ll make a great representative for the district and he, I  think, will be an excellent member of the Coalition team in Canberra.  Although I’m from the  Liberal Party of course, I’m very happy to support our cousins in the National Party on this  occasion and I certainly wish Chris well.   

 I had a very interesting discussion this morning with a number of refugees who have been  settling here in Lismore. It was a fascinating discussion we had and they were able to bring  their issues to me and I think they’ve certainly highlighted some concerns they have about,  particularly this whole question of capacity to integrate, about how well the education system  is geared to meet their concerns, the problems they have with getting driving licenses, the  difficult challenges they are facing with getting employment of course, which is a very  important component of integration. So it has been very interesting to talk to them. There are  certainly some challenging issues for them and I’ll take them away with me and we’ll see  what we can do about some of them.   

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) challenging issues a bit harder in regional areas to  overcome?   

 MR DOWNER: There’s a bit of a mixed answer to that. I mean I think they made the  point to me that community support in a city like Lismore is going to be a bit more  forthcoming. But in terms of services, for example English language, education opportunities,  particularly bearing in mind, some of them might be say 15 years of age and just put into Year  10 at school, having come from Sudan, that’s a very, very big challenge and there aren’t really  as many facilities in regional areas to help with bringing young people up to speed with the  education system as you might get in the city. So it is a bit of a mixture. But I think the  community, I hear that the community support here is very good.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree with your Immigration Minister’s recent comments?   

 MR DOWNER: Well I agree with all of the Ministers. What I’ve been interested in here  is the issues of integration and the challenges that they face. I think the first observation I’d 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 2

 make is they’ve been welcomed by the local community and I’m pleased about that. But  secondly they do have big challenges - big, big challenges - in terms of learning the  language, developing skills in order to get jobs. It’s not easy and people shouldn’t just brush  these issues aside. It’s good, by the way, to take refugees but it’s not just a question of taking  them. People who come to Australia need to be able to integrate into our society and that  obviously is a big issue for us. I mean, you know, English language skills are fundamental to  integrating into Australian society. I think we all agree on that.   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible) choosing one group of refugees over another because they  are not integrating?   

 MR DOWNER: There are 25 million or so who are refugees, officially designated  refugees, around the world and there are many more than that who have not been officially  designated refugees who are displaced. We can’t obviously take them all so we take 13,000 a  year and they’re going to vary year by year where we take them from. I think inevitably at the  moment, there should in Australia, be a real focus on taking people from Burma. It’s in our  neighbourhood, terrible things have happened in Burma in recent times so there should be a  focus on that. In terms of the broader question of integration, yes it’s very important that  when people settle into Australia as refugees and as migrants but as refugees that they are able  to settle in and integrate with our society. They are not going to do it instantly but as soon as  is practical.   

 JOURNALIST: So how do you come up with the magic number of 13,000?   

 MR DOWNER: You know, it is like the immigration program has a particular size - a  certain component of it is family reunion, a certain component is skilled, a certain component  is refugees. I think, don’t hold me to this, but I think when we came to Government the  refugee numbers were about 11,000 and it has been increased a little to around 13,000. It has  been 13,000 for a few years though, I think - maybe just two or three years or so. The focus  of our immigration program is on skilled migrants but we take, as a proportion of our 

 population, a very large number of refugees by the standards of the international community.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Downer, just on another topic, there was the findings yesterday for  the Garuda airline, the pilot was given 15 warnings. What was your reaction to that?   

 MR DOWNER: Well I had been briefed on this some time ago and what the report was  likely to find. So the first thing I’d say is that I regard this as a credible report. I think it has  been very professionally done and people who are concerned about this air crash and you can  imagine I am enormously focused on it - since some of those killed and injured were  travelling with me to Yogyakarta - my view is that this is a report to be taken very seriously.  I’ve instructed my Department to take this up now with the Indonesians and say that we  would now like to see the Indonesians consider prosecutions. This of course is a report, an  investigation - there will now have to be a police investigation into the conclusions of the  report and I hope that this will lead to prosecutions because I want to see people who have  negligently allowed Australians, as well as of course a number of other people - there were 21  people killed - but whose negligence has allowed Australians to be killed, I want to see those  people brought to justice.

 JOURNALIST: David Hicks…   

 MR DOWNER: David Hicks, must be The Greens running this one, I heard.   

 JOURNALIST: The United States Military Office has said its officers were present  when Dick Cheney intervened to get Hicks the plea bargain deal as part of the deal cut with  John Howard. In light of that, do you maintain that there was no political interference in that  case?   

 MR DOWNER: No, I’ve never said there was no political interference. There was  political interference to hasten the whole legal process. I have to say to you, The Greens can’t  have it both ways. They can’t say that we haven’t done enough to hasten the legal case against  David Hicks and on the other hand, it is outrageous that we intervened. Of course we  intervened. I spoke to Defence Secretary Gates in February in Munich and I made it very clear  to him that this had been going on for far too long. David Hicks’ trial still hadn’t been brought  forward and we wanted his trial to take place as soon as possible. The Prime Minster made  that point to Dick Cheney. He made that point in a couple of telephone conversations to  President Bush. I made that point on a number of occasions to Secretary Rice. Absolutely, the  Americans - my view of the David Hicks case is that the Americans - took way too long to  proceed with the trial but when it did happen, David Hicks confessed his guilt and did a plea  bargain and that has been a good outcome, in the sense that he is now back here in Australia,  in Yatala prison, and he will be released at the end of the year.   

 JOURNALIST: The guilty plea was part of that deal though.   

 MR DOWNER: Well whether he was guilty or not, that was a matter between the  prosecution and the defence, being David Hicks. The plea bargain wasn’t negotiated by - the  fact of a plea bargain was something we certainly promoted - but the plea bargain itself was a  matter between the prosecution and the defence. If Mr Brown, Senator Brown, thinks that  politicians negotiate the details of a plea bargain, he needs to go to law school and find out  how the system of plea bargaining works. This was a plea bargain done between the  prosecution and the defence, the defence accepted the plea bargain, the prosecution accepted  the plea bargain and David Hicks went to gaol in Australia as a result.   

 JOURNALIST: Looking back, I mean (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: None of his people - well I’m an expert on this topic - none of his  people were, although nobody has asked me about it for quite some months. Look, David  Hicks admitted his guilt. He admitted that he had been involved in terrorist organisations. He  was involved…   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: Well, well, excuse me if I draw your attention to the fact that he  admitted, he admitted that he was guilty of the charges brought against him of - well I don’t  have the details of the charges with me - but association of a terrorist organisation 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 4

 (inaudible), he was involved with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban and he is now a serving a gaol  sentence in Adelaide. I think, by the way, that is entirely appropriate. A plea bargain was  negotiated, he accepted his guilt and a bargain was done in terms of his sentence and I think it  has been a very appropriate conclusion to the end of the affair.   

 JOURNALIST: It’s five years down the track, it seems a bit of a farce if the British and  other European countries can get their detainees out of there quick smart. Why was it allowed  to drag on?   

 MR DOWNER: To be honest with you, I’m not a defendant of somebody who is  involved with Al-Qaeda. Make no mistake about it.   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: No, you were asking me a question…   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: Well our foreign policy is totally opposed to terrorism and if an  Australian citizen is stupid enough to become involved in a terrorist organisation then I’d  have to say to you that it is inevitable what the consequences will be. In the case of the  British, they hadn’t been charged, they were released on the grounds that charges were not to  be brought against them.   

 JOURNALIST: When Hicks is charges (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: Oh well, Habib was released as well, as a result of representations we  made because he wasn’t charged. Hicks was charged. There was a delay in bringing those  charges to the Military Commission. When those charges finally were heard, a plea bargain  was done. He’s back in Australia and he accepted his guilt.   

 JOURNALIST: And he’ll get out after the election.   

 MR DOWNER: Well I don’t think…   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: No he won’t. He’s free after the 31st December. Well the election is on  the 24th November.   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER: We all have our issues, mate and I’ll just make it perfectly clear to you  that you will never find me as an apologist for anybody who gets involved in terrorist  organisations. Never.   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible).

 MR DOWNER: That’s not politics, that’s your politics. We’re just doing a media  interview.   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible) SCU (inaudible) about climate change. Has anything come  of that or…   

 MR DOWNER: I haven’t been yet.   

 JOURNALIST: You haven’t been yet, ok.   

 MR DOWNER: I’m very happy to go to Southern Cross University and talk about  climate change. They have a climate change institute. This a very, very big issue and I’m  delighted that the local university has got a real focus on climate change. We need to know  more about the impact of climate change on our local environments. We need to continue to  make sure there are appropriate international policies to address the problem of greenhouse  gas emissions so it is a big issue.   

 JOURNALIST: Do regional universities play a part in forming that international policy  then?   

 MR DOWNER: Yes, absolutely. They are welcome to have direct input into the work  we’re doing. We have a conference in Bali in December and obviously Australia will be  arguing in that conference for a new agreement which will involve all of the countries of the  world, all of the members of the United Nations, in making a contribution to reducing  greenhouse gases. I think the diplomacy of this is on the one hand difficult but on the other, in  the last few months I think we’ve made real progress. I think the Sydney Declaration was a  true breakthrough in getting major emitters from developing countries like China to agree that  they themselves will have to take action to stabilise and eventually reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. I think that’s been terrific. So we’re happy for any input from local universities  into our process.
