 MEDIA RELEASE^  ... —D

 THB TRUE STORY - PART 2

 Mr Willis's release of today is a political sham.

 First, lie invents an expenditure commitment then he alleges that it creates a  "funding hole".

 His new allegation of today is total invention. He says the Coalition has a secret  plan to pay an additional $3 billion to the States over three years.

 Earlier in the week Labor was alleging a heartless plan by the Coalition to cut  government services. Apparently now it has, in fact^ .a secret plan to boost them  with expenditure increases to the States!

 The Coalition's position on Commonwealth-State Relations is quite clear. The  Premiers have requested a fixed percentage of revenue to facilitate better planning  and give certainty. We will negotiate this through the Council of Australian  Governments. The formula would have to be an averaged one. The formula to be  adopted is one that will guarantee current services and be revenue-neutral. We will 

 not adopt a formula that will haVe the effect of increased outlays for the  Commonwealth over the life of the next Parliament

 No-one could misinterpret this. It is wilful deceit to claim otherwise.

 The rest of the release is a repeat of the Beazley allegations of 16 February, already  replied to in my release of 16 February.

 However, there has been some concession by the Government and these will be  replied to overnight

 1 note again for the record, Labor has not responded to the $1.2 billion hole in the  funding of its health policy - not offset by any savings. Further, Labor persists in  relying on the 100 people owing $8 million for funding its promises (on its own  costings) in 1997-8, that is before it factors in further promises to date (Cape York  $40 million, Arts $38 million, Queensland Universities $20 million) and further 

 promises it still intends to make.

 Extension Of Migrant Waiting Period From 6 Months To 2 Years

 You have asked Access Economics to assess the plausibility of the Coalition's  claimed savings arising from the extension of the minimum period for which most  migrants m ust wait before becoming eligible for social security benefits.

 The proposed policy change is to extend the waiting period from 6 months to 2  years for most m igrants to Australia. The savings claimed by the Coalition (in  current dollars, not constant prices) are as follows ($ million):

 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 Total

 84 252 280 616

 Basis for Assessment

 (i) No Change In Behaviour

 In the absence of a detailed breakdown of current and likely average DSS  payments per eligible m igrant, our first cut at this exercise is based on the  following assumptions:

 (i) Start date: Migrants arriving in Australia from 1 April 1996.

 (ii) The average value of benefits otherwise payable to migrants who have been in  Australia between 6 months and 2 years has been adjusted, relative to 1993­ 92 levels, for actual and forecast CPI changes between 1991-92 and 1998-99.  Access Economics’ CPI forecasts from its latest Five Year Business Outlook 

 have been used as necessary.

 (iii) Immigration rates have been assumed to be those actually recorded up to and  including the September quarter 1995, and beyond th a t we have assumed  that the rate recorded for the September quarter 1995 is maintained.

 (iv) The average social security benefit per migrant who has been in Australia for  between 6 months and two years has been based on the 1990-91 estimate of  $399 million provided in the 1991 D epartm ent of Finance briefing paper  adjusted for (a) inflation in 1991-92, (b) changes in eligible m igrant numbers  between 1990-91 and 1991-92, and (c) an adjustm ent to the $399 million in an 

 attem pt to net off th a t part payable to hum anitarian/refugee m igrants who  had been in Australia for less than six months. The ratio of the Department  of Finance full-year estim ate of $250 million (1991-92 dollars) in savings  contained in its 1991 briefing paper to the "adjusted" $399 million is assumed 

 to represent the non-hum anitarian proportion of total social security  payments paid to migrants who have been in Australia between 6 months and  2 years. It is this proportion that is assumed to be affected by this proposal.

 In other words, we have effectively assumed th a t the earlier D epartm ent of  Finance costing of this proposal was correct, and have adjusted th a t costing for (i)  the start date, (ii) the effect of inflation on benefit payments over time, and (iii) the

 u ^ v y i i ; j i n u : ? j

 somewhat lower immigration rate currently applying relative to the rate in the  early 1990s.

 Before allowing for changes in behaviour (and on this see Sections (ii) and (iii)  below), these assumptions generate the following stream  of expenditure savings  (current dollar terms) relative to the current policy ($ million):

 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 Total

 59.2 212.9 250.3 522.4

 (ii) Allowing For Changes In Behaviour

 In our opinion, the abovemontioned estimates understate the likely savings from  this measure because it is likely that migrants will react to it. For any given rate  of immigration, we assume that a smaller proportion will be on social security  benefits in response to the proposed m easure w ithin the 6 months to 2 years  period after their arrival, and this reaction will reduce numbers beyond th at time  as well. (We assume th at total migrant numbers will not change as a result of the  proposed policy - given th at entry is rationed anyway - unless there is an explicit  decision to lower or raise total migrant numbers.)

 Table 1 shows the effect on expenditure savings if, over and above the assumptions  made in section (i) above, it is assumed th at the numbers receiving social security  payments between 6 months and 2 years decline as people move into employment,  or otherwise move off social security payments under the proposed policy and on  the assumption that there is no such attrition under current policy.

 In the case of a 10% attrition rate each quarter, for example, (the middle set of  figures in Table 1) the cost savings increase to the following ($ million):

 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 Total

 59.2 218.2 326.7 604.1

 Note that there is no benefit from attrition in the first financial year because the  incremental savings only accrue after the two-year waiting period is past, and arise  because, after that time, fewer people are receiving social security benefits.

 (iii) Allowing For Attrition Under The Current Policy

 If we go further, and assume that there is also some natural attrition under  current policy as well, and th at the rates of attrition discussed in Section (ii) are  over and above that, then savings become somewhat larger, at least in the first  year or two, after which they become somewhat smaller.

 Table 2 presents a matrix of possible effects, with the first column replicating the  results shown in Table 1.

 For example, if we assume a "baseline" attrition rate of 10% per quarter, plus an  incremental attrition rate of 10% per quarter, the estimated savings are as follows  ($ million):
