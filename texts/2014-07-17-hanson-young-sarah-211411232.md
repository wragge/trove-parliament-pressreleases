 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 17 July 2014   

 Children denied liberty on secret prison ship   

 The revelation that Sri Lankan children and families are being held in disturbing  conditions on board an Australian Customs vessel shows how out of control the Abbott  Government’s obsession with cruelty has become, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Tony Abbott has reached a new low, playing a dangerous game of Battelships on the  high seas, and it’s vulnerable children who are suffering” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It’s outrageous that the Abbott Government is holding children behind locked doors on a  secret prison ship in the middle of the Indian Ocean.   

 “These families have no communication with the outside world, no freedom of  movement, no privacy and no access to proper legal advice.   

 “Our country’s international reputation is being dragged through the mud by this  spectacle. Australia is better than this, but the Liberal Party’s obsession with the cheap  politics of fear is having disastrous consequences.   

 “We should be working with the UN to address the refugee crisis in our region. We could  be leading a genuine solution that cares for people in need while saving lives at sea but  instead we are watching this spectacle unfold on the high seas.”
