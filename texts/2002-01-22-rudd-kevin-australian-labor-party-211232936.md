 KEVIN RUDD M.P. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 MEDIA RELEASE

 AFGHANISTAN MINE CLEARANCE ASSISTANCE INADEQUATE

 The  Shadow  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Kevin  Rudd,  today  renewed  Labor’s  call  for the  Australian  Government  to  make  a  substantial  additional  contribution  to  the  urgent task of clearing anti-personnel landmines in Afghanistan.

 “While  yesterday’s  announcement  of  additional  Australia  aid  for  humanitarian  relief and  reconstruction  in  Afghanistan  is  welcome,  it  is  deeply  disappointing  that  the Howard Government has only allocated a mere A$500,000 for mine clearance work”, Mr Rudd said.

 “This is a very inadequate sum which in no way reflects the enormous scale of the mine clearance  task,  nor  the  vital  importance  of  this  program  to  facilitate  the  safe  return  of millions of Afghanis to their homeland.”

 “Afghanistan is one of the three most mined countries in the world.  According to the United Nations, up to 300 civilian casualties a month are still occurring through landmine accidents --  that  is,  ten  every  day,  including  children.   The  landmine  clearance  problem  is  now compounded  by  the  massive  amounts  of  unexploded  ordinance  arising  from  the  current conflict - including unexploded, yellow-coloured cluster bombs.”

 “Mine clearance is an  urgent priority.  It is vital to reduce civilian casualties and remove a major  impediment  to  the  distribution  of  emergency  food  aid  and  the  repatriation  of  3.1 million  refugees  back  to  Afghanistan  and  the  return  of  more  than  1.5  million  internally displaced persons within the country.”

 “During  my  recent  visit  to  the  Afghanistan/Pakistan  border,  UN  officials  repeatedly emphasised  that  mine  clearance  is  absolutely  critical  to  efforts  to  deal  with  the  Afghan refugee crisis.  If roads, fields and villages are mined, people are not going to go return to their homes.”

 “Australia  has  been  a  modest  contributor  to  the  United  Nations  Mine  Action  Program  in Afghanistan for some years, although this contribution was reduced to zero in 1999.  In 2000, Australia contributed US$298,000.  In comparison, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom contributed US$2.7 million each to mine clearance activities in Afghanistan.”

 “Yesterday’s  announcement  of  an  additional  Australian  contribution  of  A$500,000  is  quite inadequate.  If the Government is at all serious about dealing with the Afghan refugee crisis at  its  source,  they  will  make  a  further  substantial  contribution  to  lift  Australia’s  present contribution  by  US$2  million  as  I  recommended  in  my  recent  report  on  the  Afghanistan refugee crisis.”

 “Further assessment of the adequacy of the Government’s assistance to Afghanistan will be made in the light of the outcome of the present Tokyo international donors conference.”
