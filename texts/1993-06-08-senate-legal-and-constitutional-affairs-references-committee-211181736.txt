 SENATE LEGAL & CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENCES COMMITTEE   

 

 MEDIA RELEASE  8 June 2004   

 

 REPORT ON LEGAL AID AND ACCESS TO  JUSTICE   

 

 A major report on legal aid and access to justice was tabled in the Senate today. The  report, titled ‘Legal Aid and Access to Justice’, is the result of a year-long inquiry by the  Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The Committee held five public  hearings around the country and received over 115 submissions from Commonwealth and 

 State Governments, legal aid commissions, community groups and key stakeholders.   

 Committee Chair Senator the Hon Nick Bolkus explained: "This inquiry allowed the  Committee to examine the impact of legal aid funding arrangements introduced by the  Commonwealth Government in 1997. The Committee heard evidence from legal aid  commissions that were highly critical of those arrangements, with criticisms relating to  the administration costs, as well as highlighting errors and anomalies in the funding  model currently used by the Commonwealth to distribute funding between the states and 

 territories."    

 The Report recommends a return to the co-operative model of funding that was in place  prior to those arrangements, as well as suggesting reforms that could improve the way  funding is distributed.     

 The Report identifies several groups that are particularly restricted in gaining access to  justice, including Indigenous Australians, people in rural and remote areas, and migrants  and refugees. An area of particular concern identified in the report is the availability of  legal services for Indigenous women, who remain chronically disadvantaged. The  Committee also heard strong concern over the Government's recent decision to put  Indigenous legal services out to tender. The Report voices opposition to this, and  recommends that the exposure draft of the request to tender that is currently being  circulated should be withdrawn.   

 The Committee heard significant evidence of concerns amongst community legal centres  of the increased demands for their services, and that many centres are facing a funding  crisis. The Committee heard that the condition of some premises was so inadequate that 

 competitions have been held for the worst office, and some lawyers routinely interview  clients in their cars. The Report recommends that adequate funding be provided to  support community legal centres as an important resource in providing access to justice.   

 … Continued over ……  The report contains 63 recommendations, key recommendations of the report include: 

 â¢ That the current purchaser/provider funding arrangement of legal aid be  abolished, and that Commonwealth funding be provided in the same 'co-operative'  manner as existed prior to 1997; 

 â¢ That the Commonwealth Government fund a national survey of demand and  unmet need for legal services;  â¢ That the Commonwealth adopt appropriate guidelines and procedures in relation  to grants of legal aid for women whose circumstances are not suitable for 

 participation in primary dispute resolution;  â¢ That the Commonwealth Government provide legal funding to enable  representation to be available to all parties in family law disputes where there are  allegations of domestic violence or child abuse;  â¢ That the Commonwealth Government's 'Exposure Draft of a Request for Tender 

 for the Purchase of Legal Services for Indigenous Australians' should be  withdrawn and its underlying policy reconsidered;  â¢ That the Commonwealth and state/territory governments, in conjunction with  state and territory law societies and the Law Council of Australia, fully 

 investigate the viability of providing a subsidy and a coordinated national  approach aimed at attracting and retaining lawyers to live and work in rural,  regional and remote areas of Australia;  â¢ That the Commonwealth and state/territories jointly fund a program for a 'one-

 stop-shop' interpreter service for community legal centres and legal aid services;  â¢ That the Commonwealth Attorney-General issue binding directions to federal  government agencies to ensure that legal service providers are not disadvantaged  in procurement or purchasing of legal services due to the fact that they have acted 

 against a department in a pro-bono matter; and  â¢ That the Commonwealth Government and state/territory governments should  provide additional funding to enable community legal centres to overcome  existing operational difficulties.   

 Government Senators dissent from some recommendations but support others.   

 Senator Bolkus emphasised the need to reform the current funding of legal aid: "Current  funding models are failing the community. They are not meeting the high levels of need  across the country and there needs to be a radical overhauling of the Commonwealth  funding of legal aid".
