 SPEECH  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER

 Population Change in Asia and the Pacific:  Implications for Development Policy

 Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

 I am pleased to address this important symposium on the implications for development policy  of population change in the Asia Pacific region. 

 Today you will hear from a range of eminent speakers, including world renowned  demographers, economists and social scientists, about global population trends and their  implications for the region.

 It is important that this issue is examined. 

 That is why the Australian Government, through AusAID, is co-sponsoring today’s conference  along with the National Institute of Social Sciences and Law.

 I don’t propose to steal the thunder of the experts, but in my remarks today, I do want to  discuss some the implications of population change in our region.

 I will argue that the most effective response to these implications is the promotion of economic  growth and poverty reduction.

 I will then outline how the Government is seeking to promote growth and poverty reduction  level through its trade and aid policies.

 And then more specifically, I will touch upon some of the programs we are supporting which  are directly addressing health and family planning issues - all important factors in  demographic change.

 Population change in the Asia-Pacific region

 Over the past 50 years, the Asia-Pacific region has experienced unparalleled social and  demographic change.

 In less than two generations, the Asia-Pacific region has witnessed: 

 â     A 2.2 billion population increase from 1.4 billion in 1950, representing 60 percent of 

 the total increase in world population

 â     a reduction in infant mortality rates by almost two thirds and a decline in maternal 

 mortality by half

 â     an increase in life expectancy of about 25 years

 â     a decline in the total fertility rate by more than half

 â     a sixfold increase in urban population .

 Looking to the future, a 2001 report co-funded by Australia and the Asian Development Bank  predicted that over the next 25 years, the population in Asia alone will increase by 50 percent  from 3 billion to 4.5 billion.

 These population statistics make fascinating reading; but they do not tell the whole story.

 The demographic changes I have just described have also been accompanied by significant  gains in disposable incomes - between 1970 and 1995, per capita incomes of Asian developing  countries nearly trebled.

 Economic transformation and dramatic improvements in education, healthcare and family  planning have been fundamental forces driving demographic change.

 Demographic change, in turn, has provided favourable conditions for social and economic  development.

 Despite a rapidly growing world population, the number of people living in absolute poverty  has begun to fall - a reduction of 200 million since 1980.

 However, these positive developments have not been uniform across the region.

 Even though income levels have risen in many countries, there are still over 800 million people  in the region living on an income of less than US$1 per day.

 Although mortality and fertility rates have declined in many parts of Asia and the Pacific, they  remain worryingly high in others. 

 The Melanesia states of PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, for example, are all facing a  doubling of their populations in the next 25-27 years, placing a considerable strain on their  resources and their ability to tackle poverty.

 There are many causes of such disparity.

 One factor is conflict. 

 High mortality and high fertility, amongst other things, still persist in countries that have been  ravaged by internal conflict and war.

 Afghanistan, for example, has a 4.5% population growth rate while enduring the lowest life  expectancy in the world at 46 years - about the same as life expectancy in the middle ages in 

 Europe. 

 It is not just war though that has the potential to reverse decades of development.

 There are now some 7.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS in our region, many of whom  are of working age.

 HIV/AIDS and other pandemic diseases have the capacity to undermine economic  development, hamper the formation of sound political and economic institutions and lead to  conflict over resources.

 Without adequate management, issues of rapid urbanisation, internal and international  migration, aging populations, environmental degradation, lack of arable land and clean water,  can also erode development gains. 

 These need to be tackled head-on in our development policies for the region. 

 I will come back to these issues later in my speech.

 Economic growth - a positive factor in demographic change

 Economic growth is unquestionably a leading factor in demographic change.

 Economic growth has enabled many Asian countries to make the transformation from  essentially agrarian societies to prosperous industrialised economies in less than a generation. 

 And with prosperity and a commitment by governments to invest in human capital, has come  improved access to education, and health for millions of people - in turn encouraging lower  fertility rates.

 The record also shows that open economies are the fastest and most sustainable means of  achieving improved living standards.

 When trade grows, income follows.

 In East Asia, for example, absolute poverty has halved over the last 20 years.

 That’s a persuasive, and still enduring, case for the benefits of globalisation.

 The simple fact is that no single measure will do more to promote development in poor  countries than economic growth generated by freer trade and increased investment. 

 UK-based NGO Oxfam International calculated that a one percent increase in world export  share for each developing country region could reduce poverty by 12 per cent. 

 The Role of Trade and Australia's Policy

 Some of you may find it odd that I place such emphasis in this speech on trade issues.

 While it is a pet topic of mine, I cannot stress enough the importance I place on Australia's  trade policies, as well as our aid policies, in reducing poverty and indirectly helping to address 

 

 demographic change in our region. 

 The Doha round of World Trade Organisation negotiations presents a major opportunity for  developing countries to secure better trading conditions, and fairer trade rules, that will help  underpin development.

 This is especially the case for agriculture - many of the 100 WTO developing country  members are agricultural producers.

 Protectionism in developed countries hurts poor countries, who depend on agriculture for their  livelihoods, the hardest.

 Australia has been at the forefront of trade liberalisation by reducing protection and subsidies. 

 We continue to take an ambitious but pragmatic approach in international forums to champion  the interests of free trade - and developing countries - in agricultural products.

 We will be spending $31 million in 2003-04 to help developing countries participate in the  Round.

 And we will be providing tariff and quota free access for all goods produced in the world’s 49  Least Developed Countries and in East Timor from 1 July this year.

 We are leading by example because we believe that a fairer global trading regime is the biggest  contribution we can make to developing countries and the two billion people estimated to be  living in poverty. 

 The Role of Australia’s Aid Program 

 Trade is only one part of the story. 

 To maximise the benefits of trade liberalisation and growth in reducing poverty, developing  countries need to strengthen domestic governance and improve access to basic services.

 Our aid program plays a critical role in helping countries in our region address these  challenges.

 Poverty is often accompanied by unemployment, malnutrition, illiteracy, low status of women,  refugee flows and limited access to social and health services, including family planning. 

 All these factors contribute to high levels of fertility, morbidity and mortality, as well as to low  economic productivity. 

 Our aid program tackles these issues head-on.

 It places a high priority on development in the Asia Pacific, where the majority of the world’s  poor live.

 And it puts Australia in a position to respond to the often wrenching changes in a dynamic  region.

 We focus on enabling the poor to increase their productivity, through access to credit, markets, 

 property rights, technology, education and health, including reproductive health. 

 We strengthen systems of governance to improve accountability and provide better access to  services, resources and decision-making by the poor. 

 And we address the vulnerability of the poor to illness, conflict, natural disaster and economic  crisis.

 Our aid program specifically takes into account the demographics of poverty and population.

 While recognising the increasingly demanding issues of urbanisation, we know that the  majority of poor people still live in rural areas. 

 Agricultural and rural development are therefore essential building blocks for our region’s  future.

 That is why we will be investing some $255 million in 2003-04 in rural development, mostly  in the Asia-Pacific region. 

 And that is why in countries such as Cambodia, Laos, East Timor and Papua New Guinea, we  aim our development programs squarely at rural populations. 

 We also recognise that as population increases, the needs of industry, agriculture and food  production are placing increasing pressures on natural resources. 

 It is estimated that by 2025, 4 billion people worldwide will be suffering from lack of access to  clean water. 

 In March this year, on the eve of World Water Day, I launched our new policy on water:  Making Every Drop Count. 

 We are committing $94 million to water-related programs next financial year and have  established an Australian Water Research Facility to help apply Australian expertise to  regional water challenges.

 While progress in agricultural technology has given the world the tools to produce sufficient  food for everyone, over 800 million people around the world remain chronically under-nourished today - many of them in South Asia and East Asia. 

 The challenge now facing us is to find sustainable ways to increase yields without causing  further damage to our fragile environment. 

 Developments in biotechnology and genetically modified crops could deliver a second Green  Revolution, and these new technologies must be put to use in the battle against world hunger.

 Australia has pledged $1 billion over five years to programs and initiatives that enhance food  security.

 The pledge covers not only immediate food aid needs, but also aims to boost agricultural  production, research and development. 

 Population and health programs

 I now want to touch on some of our Government's programs to help countries in our region  with their population policies, including reproductive health and family planning. 

 Our commitment to health and population programs in the region goes beyond humanitarian  concerns.

 High fertility and poor health directly affect the ability of families to accumulate capital, and to  feed and educate children, thus eroding economic development.

 Moreover the inability of governments to provide adequate essential services to rapidly  increasing populations contributes to political instability.

 In this context, in 2003-04, Australia will provide some $75 million for family planning,  population policy, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS prevention and care.

 Improving maternal health is vital in efforts to reduce poverty. 

 Australia’s assistance for reproductive health programs includes women’s health services, such  as safe childbirth, pre- and post-natal care, immunisation and safe, voluntary and affordable  family planning.

 In the Pacific region, for instance, we are running a particularly successful reproductive health  and family planning training project, aimed at developing local expertise among teachers,  nurses and educators.

 Education for women and girls also has a strong correlation with fertility rates and maternal  and child health. 

 In 2003-04, Australia will provide an estimated $370 million in education assistance - 37% of  this will be directed at basic education with a strong emphasis on equity for women and girls in  rural communities. 

 Australia has also played a leadership role in combating the spread of HIV/AIDS in the region,  having facilitated regional conferences on HIV/AIDs.

 At the ASEAN meeting last August, I launched the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum on  HIV/AIDS and Development. 

 This initiative complements our ongoing work with UNAIDS and puts HIV/AIDS on top of  the region’s political agenda.

 Australia is also helping developing countries counter the advance of HIV/AIDS through a six-year, $200 million initiative. 

 In the last two years, we have spent well over $50 million on activities directly aimed at  reducing HIV infections - and we are continuing to build on this work with new projects. 

 Of course there is much more to do.

 We will continue to work with regional governments, NGOs, and local communities to offer  lifesaving treatment for mothers and their babies, prevent unwanted pregnancies through 

 family planning, and help slow the spread of AIDS in the region.

 Conclusion

 Ladies and gentlemen

 Australia is very conscious of the need to come to grips with the complex issues of population  and development in its own neighbourhood. 

 We are tackling these issues at a number of levels, both directly and indirectly. 

 But I cannot emphasise too much that promoting economic growth and reducing poverty lie at  the very heart of the issue.

 Only through such action can we truly give developing country populations a fair chance to  break the vicious cycle of poverty and high fertility and mortality rates.

 A symposium such as this provides new impetus for this important debate, and thereby  advances the population and development agenda for our region.

 In that spirit, please accept my best wishes for the success of your deliberations.
