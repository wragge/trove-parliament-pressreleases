 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 MORRISON’S REGIONAL CO-OPERATION CONSISTS OF A PARTY OF ONE   

 

 Labor is deeply concerned about Scott Morrison’s glaring lack of engagement with  Indonesia over his announcement to no longer take refugees from Indonesia after 1 July  this year.   

 It is clear from the comments Scott Morrison has made in the last 24 hours that he has  not had any dialogue with his Indonesian counterpart over Australia’s decision.   

 We must work co-operatively with our regional neighbours to have a long-term and  sustainable solution to deal with displaced people in South-East Asia and tackle people  smuggling.   

 Comments from Indonesia's Justice and Human Rights Minister, Yasonna Laoly today  that this decision will place a greater burden on Indonesia expose a shift in Australia’s  regional engagement.   

 Under Labor, Australia’s humanitarian intake was set at 20,000 places - that number  has been slashed by the Abbott Government to 13,750 - against the advice of the  Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers.
