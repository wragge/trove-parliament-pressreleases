 Budget 2008-09 - Australia increases commitment to  refugees 

 Tuesday, 13 May 2008 

 The Rudd Government will increase Australia’s refugee and humanitarian  intake as part of its commitment to offer a new life to those most in need, the  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today. 

 The Humanitarian Program is increasing to 13 500 in 2008-09. This includes  6500 offshore refugee places, with a one-off increase of 500 places in the  coming financial year to assist people affected by the conflict in Iraq. 

 From 2009-10 onwards, there will be an increase of 750 places in the Special  Humanitarian Program to 7750 places. 

 ‘The offshore component of the 2008-09 Humanitarian Program will focus on  refugees from Africa, Asia and the Middle East,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘We are committed to helping people in vulnerable situations from around the  world, in particular Iraqi nationals and refugees in Africa who are unable to  return to their homes. 

 ‘The target for the Woman at Risk category will remain at 10.5 per cent of the  offshore refugee allocation. 

 ‘The size and composition of the program was decided after taking into  consideration the views expressed across the Australian community, non-government organisations and the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees.’ 

 Senator Evans said the Budget also allocates $10 million in 2008-09 to assist  with stabilising populations in Iraq through the Displaced Persons and  Refugee Fund. 

 Another $42 million is provided over four years to enable the permanent  resettlement in Australia of Iraqi employees, who provided support to  Australian troops in Iraq, and their families. 

 The new visa policy, announced last month, will assist up to 600 people,  comprising locally engaged employees and their families, at risk in Iraq  because of their engagement with the Australian Government. 

 ‘Due to the personal security situation these people will face as Australia  withdraws its combat forces from southern Iraq, this policy will give them the  opportunity to start a new life in Australia,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘The funding will cover the costs of visa processing, transport to Australia,  settlement, health, education, employment assistance and income support.’ 

 Senator Evans said the Rudd Government intended to place more of a focus  on delivering effective ways to assist humanitarian entrants into employment  as quickly as possible. 

 ‘This will include examining the expansion of the regional resettlement  program, particularly in areas where there are critical labour shortages,’  Senator Evans said. 

 Any expansion of the program will require a coordinated approach involving  local employers, industry groups and training organisations, and state and  territory governments.
