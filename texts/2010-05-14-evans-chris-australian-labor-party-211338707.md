 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Baseless claims further undermine Scott  Morrison's credibility  Friday, 14 May 2010 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today refuted  accusations made by Opposition immigration spokesperson, Scott Morrison, in  relation to the appointment of John Gibson to the selection advisory committee for  the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). 

 Mr Gibson, President of the Refugee Council of Australia, was appointed to the  selection advisory committee as a community representative. 

 ‘Mr Gibson is a highly respected lawyer within the community sector, whose  independence and integrity were recognised by former immigration ministers Philip  Ruddock and Amanda Vanstone, who briefed him to represent them in migration  matters in the Federal Court,’ Senator Evans said. 

 For both the July 2009 member recruitment round and the current recruitment round,  the selection advisory committees consisted of representatives from the Department  of Immigration and Citizenship, the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC),  the MRT/RRT and a community representative. 

 The selection process for the MRT/RRT is a totally apolitical and merit-based  process, in accordance with the APSC guidelines for the appointment of statutory  office holders. 

 The presence of the APSC Merit Protection Commissioner on the selection advisory  committee was a clear indication of the Rudd Government's commitment to a  transparent and merit-based process without any political influence. 

 ‘It is disappointing that not only has Mr Morrison made baseless claims but he has  attacked the reputation of Mr Gibson, as well as the independence of the tribunals,’  Senator Evans said.
