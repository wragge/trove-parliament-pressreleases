 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC  AFFAIRS AND MINISTER ASSISTING THE PRIME  MINISTER FOR MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

 Senator Nick Bolkus B65/94 â€” ------------------Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 (06) 277 7860

 LABOR REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURALISM

 The Australian Labor Party today strengthened its commitment to  immigration and multiculturism with resounding endorsement of a  revised platform on immigration, ethnic affairs and population.

 Addressing delegates to the ALP National Conference in Hobart,  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick  Bolkus, said the new ALP policy:

 .  restates support for a non-discriminatory,  global 

 immigration program;

 .  recognises our successful humanitarian program which sees  Australia accepting more such cases per capita than any  other country;

 .  supports an important, world-leading program in the "Woman  at Risk" component of the refugee program;

 .  recognises the advantages business and focused temporary  migration bring to Australia;

 . reinforces the ALP's commitment as a party to social justice  and access and equity programs;

 . supports the Government's intention to further review the  Citizenship Act to strengthen "Citizenship" as a unifying  factor in our society;

 . recognises the enormous trade,  business and employment 

 potential of Australia's diverse human cultural and language  resources.

 "After 12 years of Government, one of Labor's most fundamental  achievements is the development of a unique and overwhelmingly  successful multicultural society," Senator Bolkus said. "The rest  of the world is increasingly looking at our experience for 

 answers to their problems."

 He said legislation and education programs combatting 

 discrimination had combined with the delivery of a comprehensive  social justice agenda to underpin a truly 'inclusive' society.

 "We should not be shy about the fact that only Labor can deliver  the sort of social infrastructure which makes multicultural  Australia a success," he said. "Programs delivering health,  education and welfare services together with the protection of  wage and industrial standards,  as well as our access and equity 

 agenda,  are fundamental to our society's future."
