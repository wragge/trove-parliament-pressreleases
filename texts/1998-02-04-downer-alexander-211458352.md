I am pleased to announce a contribution from the Australian Government of
$13.5 million to support the work of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR). This contribution will support the work of UNHCR in
providing protection to refugees and displaced persons around the
globe.

 It is a sad fact that as we approach the end of the 20th
Century, substantial numbers of displaced people make the work of UNHCR as
vital now as it was at the time of the organisation's inception in
1949.

 Today there are some 22 million people who are cared for
by UNHCR. The vast majority of these are from developing countries. The
Australian Government accepts its responsibility as a member of the
international community to contribute to efforts to provide adequate care
for these people until a durable solution to their plight can be
found.

 UNHCR has a well-earned reputation as an effective and
efficient United Nations organisation. Under the capable leadership of Mrs
Ogata, who I met today, the organisation has grown to meet the challenges of
mass displacement thrown up by the post cold war era.

 In
addition, I am pleased to announce that Australia is providing $2.7 million
to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to provide essential
education, health, relief and social services to Palestinian refugees in the
Middle East, as part of Australia's continuing efforts to support the
restoration of peace in the region.

 As well, $700,000 will be
provided by the Australian Government through AusAID to the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to support the work it has been doing for
over 130 years in providing protection and assistance to victims of armed
conflict and in promoting conflict prevention.
