 Australia Welcomes Refugee Families

 VPS 038/2005

 More than 350 refugees - including over 200 children - will arrive in Australia in the next two weeks, Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced today. 

 ‘On behalf of all Australians, I welcome them to their new home and future,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘More than 160 of the children are under 12 years old and many of them have spent their entire lives in refugee camps.’

 Senator Vanstone said the 354 refugees had been living in refugee camps in Tanzania after fleeing persecution in countries including Burundi, the  Republic of Congo and other central African countries. Australia has been asked by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to resettle  these refugees.

 ‘They have been living in desperate situations in these camps, which do not have running water or electricity,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘On average they have spent eight years in camps.’

 The refugees, who will arrive in stages in the next fortnight, will settle in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western  Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

 The first group arrives in Sydney on Tuesday. 

 ‘The experiences they have had to endure means they need the support of the Australian Government and all Australians to ensure their transition  to their new lives is a success,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘As Australians we can be proud of our generous spirit and the many programs we have in place to help these refugees to become self-sufficient  and participate in the community as quickly as possible.

 ‘Our Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy includes links to essential services such as Centrelink, Medicare and banking, as well as  accommodation support, help to establish a household, and health and psychological services.’

 These refugees are among the 13,000 people who will be resettled in Australia in 2004-05 under the Humanitarian Program.
