 Minister for Foreign Affairs   The Hon Julie Bishop MP 

 Doorstop interview, Parliament House,  Canberra  Transcript, E&OE 

 8 February 2016 

 JULIE BISHOP          This ballistic missile launch is further provocative, destabilising and dangerous behaviour 

 from North Korea. This latest ballistic missile test comes on from a fourth nuclear test carried out by North 

 Korea in recent times and this is aggravating an already tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. Australia 

 supports the UN Security Council statement and all previous resolutions and I know the Security Council is 

 considering further significant measures. I call on the North Korean regime to focus on the plight of the long- suffering people of North Korea - and not engage in provocative and dangerous testing of nuclear weapons and 

 ballistic missiles - but support the people of North Korea who in some cases are literally starving. The World 

 Food Program has made an extensive effort because of the plight of the North Korean people and that’s where 

 the regime’s focus should be. 

 JOURNALIST            What are the dangers of these being tested? 

 JULIE BISHOP          Clearly it increases tensions with South Korea and Japan. Clearly if North Korea were to 

 gain a nuclear arsenal of ballistic missiles and weapons that would be a threat to regional and to global 

 security. 

 JOURNALIST            You have spoken to Jocelyn Elliott following her release; how is she doing and what is 

 being done to ensure her husband is also released? 

 JULIE BISHOP          We have been working on this matter for some weeks now, ever since the Elliotts 

 disappeared. Thankfully Mrs Elliott has been released and we continue to work with the governments in the 

 region, particularly the government of Burkina Faso and the government of Niger, to facilitate his release. I 

 remain concerned for Kenneth Elliott’s safety and well-being and will continue to work towards ensuring his 

 release. 

 JOURNALIST            What do you make of the Premiers calling on the Government to keep the asylum 

 seekers in Australia as opposed to their deportation to Nauru? 

 JULIE BISHOP          Our Government will discuss these matters with the State Premiers but of course we 

 remain resolute in our policies. We are determined to ensure that the people smuggling trade does not flourish. 

 When Labor weakened our border protection laws the people smuggling trade flourished and twelve hundred 

 men women and children drowned at sea. So we must maintain the policies that work, that have dismantled the 

 people smuggling trade, and have ensured that people will no longer die at sea. Those policies will remain in 

 place. In the meantime we look for regional solutions and I am attending the Bali process meetings to ensure 

 that our region can do what it can to prevent people smuggling from flourishing. 

 JOURNALIST            Is it frustrating to see other leaders not support the Government’s stance on people 

 smugglers? 

 JULIE BISHOP          There were 2000 children in detention under the previous Government. We’ve now got 

 that number down to around 100 and we’re working very hard to ensure children are not in detention. 

 JOURNALIST            Minister, is the prospect of an increased GST on the table or off the table? 

 JULIE BISHOP          These are matters for the Cabinet to discuss. We’ve been having a wide-ranging 

 discussion with the Australian people, with business, with industry, with small business owners, with Members 

 of Parliament about the best tax system for Australia. We are determined to ensure that our tax system is fair, 

 that taxes are lower, that taxes are simpler, that we’re internationally competitive, and that we provide 

 incentives for people to work, save and invest. So that’s what we’re seeking to achieve, and when the Prime 

 Minister and Treasurer have an announcement to make, fine. 

 JOURNALIST            Do you think Members within your own Party, particularly those with quite small margins, 

 have a right to be concerned that there could be significant backlash to any rise in the GST? 

 JULIE BISHOP          Let’s deal with facts rather than speculation. When the Cabinet has made its decision in 

 regard to the tax package, in relation to economic reform, we’ll announce it. 

 JOURNALIST            Will that sort of speculation play any role, particularly if those backbenchers are coming 

 to the Prime Minister and Treasurer saying they don’t want to lose their seat, will that play any role in the 

 decision? 

 JULIE BISHOP          That’s why I’m not commenting on speculation, because it’s speculation. We are looking 

 at an evidence-based range of options, and we need to ensure that our tax system has lower, fairer, simpler 

 taxes, that it is internationally competitive and that it provides incentives for Australians to work, save and 

 invest. That’s what we’re seeking to do. We’ve been having a mature discussion on this, a sophisticated 

 discussion. Meanwhile Mr Shorten has been lingering around grocery aisles and declaring lettuce wars, 

 claiming the Government is raising GST. The Government never said that. We’ve said that we’re looking at all 

 the options available and when we’ve got an announcement to make, we’ll do that prior to the election.
