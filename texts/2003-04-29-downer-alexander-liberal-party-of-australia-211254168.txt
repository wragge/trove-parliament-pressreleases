 29 April 2003

 Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer

 Transcript: Doorstop interview - Regional Ministerial Conference on People  Smuggling - Bali

 Downer: Let me just make a couple of points. We obviously got the meeting  underway this morning and we are delighted with the turnout at the meeting.  There are something like 28 Ministerial Delegations from 32 countries and we  have the Head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the High  Commissioner himself Mr Lubbers, and some other international organisations. It  is a very good turnout. For us, as Australians, there is no doubt that this co-hosting of this second conference with the Indonesians illustrates the strength of  the relationship now between Australia and Indonesia. This is a relationship  which has grown stronger over the last 18 months. Remember, we came out of a  difficult time over East Timor and since then we have really started to address  regional issues together. Putting together these Bali People Smuggling  Conferences has been a great achievement and the conference is going well. The  working groups have provided their reports, constructive reports, and progress  has been made. These things all take time though, but we are heading in the  right direction which is good.

 Journalist: Indonesia's Foreign Minister has said that unilateralism of the  parties, referring to the Iraq War, was unfortunate and was threatening  multilateral platforms….

 Downer: I said to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, both last night and this  morning, that we understood that Indonesia had its own perspective on the issue  of the war in Iraq, but the Prime Minister and I very much appreciate the way  that domestically Indonesia has managed to keep the population under control.  There have been demonstrations; I think the largest of which the Foreign  Minister tells me was in Surabaya. The demonstrations didn't get out of control  and there was no significant violence and I think the Indonesian Government  deserves a good deal of credit for its careful management of this difficult issue.  We went out of our way when several of us were here a few weeks ago, by here  I mean actually in Jakarta, to say to the Indonesians that if there was to be a  war in Iraq this wouldn't be a war against Islam. I also made that point to the  Heads of NU and Muhammadiyah and the Indonesian Government, even though  of course, they unequivocally disagreed with the Coalition's decision to remove  by force the regime of Saddam Hussein, they nevertheless went out of their way  to ensure that the people of Indonesia understood that this wasn't some sort of  'Holy War' or a 'War against Islam'. I think they have done a very good job  keeping the community under control and, of course, allowing people to protest.  I think they have managed the issue extremely well and it is a point that I have  gone out of way to make to Hassan Wirajuda while I have been here.

 Journalist: You don't think that the bilateral relationship has been affected at all  by Australia's participation in the coalition of the willing?

 Downer: No, not only did Hassan Wirajuda make that point a few weeks ago  during the war, but he repeated that point to me during my visit here. It is not  an issue that has impinged on our bilateral relationship. I think that in the end  they obviously disagree with the war and the Foreign Minister has repeated that  today. There is no question about that, they have never made any secret of  disagreeing with the war and they have said that all along. They have managed  their domestic constituencies and their bilateral relationships quite well in spite of  that, which is a great achievement. Journalist: Is this the forum to bring that up again, as you say they have  mentioned this in the past… Downer: They have got to manage these issues in their own way; we don't offer  any advice on how to do that. We don't agree, but that is not a problem for us.

 Journalist: What's the message that a unilateral approach on an issue like Iraq  can damage this kind of multilateral platform. Are you suggesting that damage to  the United Nations might damage this sort of multilateral visit?

 Downer: We have the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here. You  know, the United Nations have done many good things over the years and it will  do many good things in the future. You have to look around pragmatically for  forums that we will be able to achieve successful outcomes. We have put  together here, in this part of the world, the Bali process which has been a  multilateral but regionally oriented process which has achieved good outcomes  and is continuing to achieve good outcomes. In the case of Iraq, we supported  every effort through the United Nations Security Council and have achieved good  outcomes. That is, disarmament of the regime of Saddam Hussein without  military action - that wasn't possible. We look to outcomes and sometimes the  United Nations is good at achieving outcomes, sometimes it is not. It did not  achieve a very good outcome in Rwanda where 700,000 people were killed; it  achieved a good outcome in East Timor; it varies. Journalist: The Foreign Minister has also said, regarding boat people who are  transiting through Indonesian waters, they won't be detained. The policy is not to  assist them on their way to Australia, a kind of a neutral policy, is that what you  expect?

 Downer: Those people won't be arriving in Australia. I am entirely confident of  that. I don't think there is any risk of those people coming to Australia.

 Journalist: Why do you say that?

 Downer: Well, I have spoken with the Indonesians about it and they will  manage these issues in their own way. These are sensitive questions in  Indonesia, but I am very confident these people won't come to Australia and we  appreciate the approach that Indonesia takes on dealing with these issues.

 Journalist: Have you been giving an undertaking that the Indonesian national  policy will be to intervene in these transiting voyages, rather than to resupply 

 them and put them back to sea?

 Downer: I have been given an undertaking that Indonesia will handle these  issues in their own way, but these are sensitive issues which need to be handled  sensitively and that achieves better outcomes for us than playing "diplomatic bull  in a china shop" which is not the approach I can promise you no matter how hard  the ABC or others may goad me. Journalist: When you say they won't reach Australia, who is going to stop them?  The Australian Navy? Or will they get beyond Indonesian waters?

 Downer: No, I don't think they will get beyond Indonesian waters.

 Journalist: I understand that Colin Powell is talking to America's allies in  relation to North Korea offering to scale back or ditch its nuclear arms program  for concessions from the US. Are you aware of that?

 Downer: We have had frequent contact with the Americans, including Colin  Powell, I was with him very recently in Washington. We spent quite a long  together late at night in his house in Virginia and we talked, obviously, about  Iraq and post war reconstruction and those issues. We talking at very great  length about North Korea and I also spoke with the President himself the  following day and the Vice President about North Korea, so we are in constant  contact with the Americans on the issue of North Korea. As you know the  Americans have just had a round of talks chaired by the Chinese and a group of  North Koreans and we have been in full contact with the Americans since those  talks. Our take out of those talks that it was a good start. There has been a lot of  speculation in the media about how those talks went, but the Americans  themselves haven't done very much briefing of the media, so a lot of the media  commentary is speculation because of that. I think we will leave any briefing  though to the Americans, not do that ourselves. But our takeout of those talks is  that they were a useful beginning, but remember this is just a beginning of a  process that, I believe, will take quite a lot of time and we will be continuing to  urge the maintenance of a diplomatic solution to this problem, we hope that this  can be achieved and we are optimistic that it will be achieved.

 Journalist: Do you think that North Korea has just been constructing the best  possible negotiating position, its most dangerous and threatening position, so  that it can get the best deal climbing down?

 Downer: I think that some of the language they have used is to maximise their  negotiating position, for example claiming at one stage that they are  reprocessing or they have finished reprocessing uranium and fuel rods and that  they have many, many nuclear weapons. This sort of language just doesn't  reflect our assessment of the reality or America's assessment of the reality. I  don't think they have been doing the reprocessing at Yongbyon that they claim  and if they have nuclear warheads we think they may have somewhere between  one and three. They don't have dozens and dozens of them, nor do they have  yet long range intercontinental ballistic missiles that they could fire over 15,000  kilometres. But there is no question about it; they are working on all these  things. I think some of their rhetoric is deliberately exaggerated, but that is the  nature of these sorts of regimes, they are into that kind of rhetoric and not  subject to the scrutiny that a country like ours is subject to, by people like you.
