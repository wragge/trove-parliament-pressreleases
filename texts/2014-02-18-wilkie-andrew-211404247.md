 MEDIA ALERT: MANUS ISLAND BLOODSHED 

 

 The Independent Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, will discuss the crisis engulfing  Australia’s irregular immigration policy.  WHEN: 12:45pm TODAY 18 February  WHERE: Parliament House Lawns Hobart  “The Abbott Government’s response to asylum seekers is madness,” Mr Wilkie said.  “Refusing  to  take  in  people  claiming  to  flee  other  countries  for  their  lives  is  cruel  and   entirely  at  odds  with  Australia’s  legal  obligation  as  a  signatory  to  the  Refugee   Convention.  “Towing  boats  back  to  Indonesia,  and  even  supplying  new  boats  for  the  journey,  is  an   especially gross abuse of our obligations as a rich and civilised country.  “Moreover breaching Indonesian sovereignty is  just  the sort  of recklessness  that  causes   accidents and even armed conflict.  “And now we have the news that the situation on Manus Island in PNG has degenerated  into widespread violence, mass casualties and at least one death.  “The  Abbott  Government  wants  to  keep  all  this  secret,  but  the  secret’s  out  and  the   Government should be ashamed of itself for doing this in our name.”  For more information: Alex Moores 0417 382 542
