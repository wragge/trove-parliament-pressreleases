 “MAJOR PARTIES IGNORING OUR HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS” -MP “The  Howard  Government  and  Beazley  Opposition  have  ignored  our international  humanitarian  obligations  and  undermined  Australia’s  reputation by  supporting  the incoherent and  xenophobic migration  laws  before the Senate today,” Independent MP for Calwell, Dr Andrew Theophanous, said today.

 “Government  rhetoric  has  focussed  on  the  need  to  bring  Australia  in  line  with  the processes  of  the  United  Nations.  Yet,  an  UNHCR  representative  has  said  that  they have some major reservations with this legislation.

 “The  package  of  Bills  are  dangerous  and  have  racist  undertones  which  will  only support the actions of a vocal minority who have vented their prejudice against people from Muslim backgrounds over the past two weeks.

 “I  was  the  only  Member  of  the  House  of  Representatives  to  vote  against  these Bills.  There  are  many  MP’s  from  both  sides  of  the  House  that  have  privately complimented  me  on  the  stance  I  have  taken,  and  expressing  frustration  that they  were  tied  by  party  discipline  from  expressing  their  true  feelings  in Parliament.

 “The  incoherence  of  the  policies  is  shown  by  the  fact  that  the  hideously  expensive actions of the Government (estimated at $100 million) in shifting 500 asylum-seekers to Nauru and New Zealand will have been a gross abuse of taxpayers’ money, since it will  not  succeed.  This  is  supported  by the  fact  that  the  UNHCR  has  said  today that even those Afghani asylum-seekers who do not receive refugee status cannot be sent home due to the imminent US-led war on their country. If the Government ignores the UNHCR,  and  chooses  to  send  those  families  back  to  their  likely deaths,  Australia’s humanitarian record will be irreparably damaged.

 “As I pointed out in a question to the Prime Minister last week, it is also incoherent for  Australia  to  be  attacking  Afghani  asylum-seekers  who  have  escaped  from  the Taliban  regime,  while  at  the  same  time  actively  supporting  the  United  States  in  its campaign against the vicious Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Australia has taken less than  0.01%  of  the  total  number  of  Afghani  refugees  worldwide.  Surely  we  need  to show some compassion for those that have escaped this terrorist regime.

 “The bi-partisan support received shows that, as far as both parties are concerned, playing politics is far more important than the humane treatment of people in need. The politicising of this issue, and the Government’s actions in turning the refugees into  a  political  football  (the  more  of  them  you  kick,  the  more  votes  you  get)  is  a disgusting distortion of representative democracy in this country.

 “The  Government  and  Opposition  have  acted  under  the  guise  of  representing Australian sentiment. If the Australian people had been in receipt of all the facts regarding  refugees,  rather  than  biased  and  perverted  information,  they  would not be so supportive of this type of legislation. This issue is a perfect example of where  Australia  requires  leadership  by  both  our  parties,  to  lead  the  way  and restore Australia’s proud humanitarian record.

 “I believe there are some major flaws in the arguments in favour of the legislation. I have illustrated these in basic point form below:

 â¢ The  institution  of  mandatory  sentencing  for  the  first  time  in  Australia’s legislative history; â¢ The fact that the Bill is dated retrospectively so as to justify unlawful actions committed by the Government over the past few weeks; â¢ The  effective  abandonment  of  our  humanitarian  obligations,  in  sharing

 the burden of religious persecution in other countries. On this point it must be  remembered  that  54%  of  unauthorised  boat  arrivals  in  2000/2001  were from  Afghanistan.  Of  these,  between  85-93%  are  eventually  accepted  as genuine  refugees.  However,  the  amount  of  Afghani  refugees  Australia receives  is  less  than  0.01%  of  the  total  number  of  Afghani  refugees  world-wide, estimated at more than four million; â¢ The outrageous precedent set by excising certain Australian territories from

 Australian migration laws. This has now laid a foundation for any future laws to only apply to certain areas of Australia, and not others; â¢ The  complete  lack  of  recognition  that  a  lack  of  any  Australian  consular representation in Afghanistan and Iraq means these people are left with no

 alternative but to arrive here by unauthorised means (no “queues” to “jump”); â¢ By legislating to give the Australian Defence Forces the power to take boats of asylum-seekers  to  a  third  destination  effectively  causes  the  Australian Government  to  enter  the  “people  trafficking”  business,  with  the  only

 difference being that the taxpayer is footing the bill. â¢ The  failure  to  recognise  that  a  recent  UCLA  study  has  shown  that unauthorised immigration boosts the US economy by $800 billion per year; â¢ The failure to acknowledge that Australia currently hosts one refugee for

 every 1583 Australian person. In comparison, Tanzania hosts one refugee for  every  76  Tanzanian  people,  and  Britain  hosts  one  for  every  530 Britons.  These  facts  are  completely  at  odds  with  the  Government’s repeated claim of Australia’s “generosity”; â¢ The failure to recognise that 78% of unauthorised boat arrivals are fleeing the

 Taliban  regime  in  Afghanistan,  and  Saddam  Hussein’s  Iraq  -  the  very dictatorships that Australia appears about to go to war with; â¢ The failure to recognise that in the past week Iran has taken more unauthorised arrivals than Australia has over the past five years.

 I have prepared very detailed notes on all of these above issues, which I am happy to distribute to any interested parties.
