 Liberal MP’s are revolting  24th May 2006 

 

 Some Liberal MPs have a welcome homecoming gift for the PM-   a vote against his new   Immigration law changes . 

 The debate resumes this week in the House of Representatives and Victorian  backbencher Russell Broadbent is one of several angry MPs planning to defy John  Howard and cross the floor. Petro Georgiou, Bruce Baird and Judi Moylan could well follw  suit. 

 The Immigration Law amendments were rushed into into Parliament following  Indoensia's fury over refugee visas granted to 42 Papuans.  The changes expand the  Howard Government's "Pacific Solution" to allow asylum seekers to be processed on  Nauru or Manus Island. The amendments are a breach fo the undertakings the PM made  his party room, to treat asylum seekers with greater compassion, and Petro Gerogiou's  threat to introduce a private member's bill to amend the mandatory detention system  could again gain momentum. 

 Labor wil not support the legislation and we are encouraging unhappy Liberal MPs and  Senators to join us in defiance of the Prime Minister's position
