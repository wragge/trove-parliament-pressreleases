 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday, 14 October 2014    

 Abbott government in court on back of grave  injustices    

 A High Court case being heard today regarding the 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers, who were  detained on the high seas for a month, is a result of the government’s arrogance and its obsession  with cruelty, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “The government has gotten itself into a legal mess,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “It’s being dragged before the courts, over and over again, because of its obsession with cruelty.    

 “The government is expecting to lose this case and, in a cowardly move, has already introduced a bill  to pre-empt that outcome. They are trying to give themselves a license to breach international law  and the standards of common decency.    

 “This is a government that shoots first and asks questions later.”    

 In a second case being argued today, the government is defending its bizarre claim that babies born  in Australia came by boat.    

 “These babies deserve protection,” Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “Saying that babies who were born in Australian hospitals came by boat is farcical. Through this  ridiculous and cruel argument, the government is trying to make a generation of children stateless.    

 “Australia should be processing people’s claims and offering protection to those who deserve it, not  getting caught up in costly legal battles because of its cruel practices.”
