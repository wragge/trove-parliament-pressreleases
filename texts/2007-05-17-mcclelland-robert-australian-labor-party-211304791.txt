 GLOBAL WARNING: AUSTRALIA AND THE INTERNATIONAL 

 RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE 

 

 Ignoring the warnings at our peril   

 Last week Rupert Murdoch signed up one of Australia’s leading companies to  join the non-profit, emissions reducing Climate Group. Instructively this was  another example of business being way ahead of the Howard Government's  inaction on climate change. In signing up News Limited Mr Murdoch said:   

 "Climate change poses clear, catastrophic threats… we may not agree  on the extent, but we certainly can't afford the risk of inaction."    

 Mr Murdoch is absolutely right. The threat to our environment and security  posed by climate change is one of those seminal issues that has both woken  and motivated the Australian electorate. And so it should.    

 As Labor Spokesman on Foreign Affairs I want to initially focus on the  international security issues arising from climate change.  Some of those  consequences are most profound in our own region.  

 

 I will conclude by emphasising the constructive role that Australia can and  should be playing when it comes to finding a solution to climate change.   

 The national security effects   

 Aside from the economic and environmental impact, many respected  international experts have identified climate change as a major threat to  national, regional and international security.    

 Last month the British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett regarded the  matter as so significant that she brought it before the UN Security Council. In  doing so she reported:   

  1

 “Climate change is a security issue: but it is not a matter of narrow  national security- it has a new dimension. This is about our collective  security in a fragile and increasingly interdependent world.”1  

 Also in April eleven retired US Generals and Admirals published a report titled  National Security and the Threat of Climate Change. 2  The report put climate  change front and centre of the national security debate.  

 

 These distinguished military officers were not “tree huggers” or unshaven  student activists looking for a cause - they are all hardened warriors. Their  report warned that violent weather events along coastlines, mass migration of 

 people, conflict over resources and changing national borders would create  major drivers for global instability.  

 Admiral Joseph Prueher, former Commander-in Chief of US Pacific  Command, said the signs are particularly relevant to the Asia Pacific region.3   He warned that extreme weather conditions may force governments in Asia to  become more authoritarian. He also stated that the structures of regional  governance may break down in the face of climate change pressure, writing: 

 “You see mass destruction in countries where the government is not  robust. When people can’t cope, governing structures break down.” 

 For an Australian Government that has already proven itself unable to deal  with the long term implications of unstable and collapsed governments in our  region, this is a dire warning. 

 

 It is arguable that the effects of climate change are already producing conflict.   In a speech delivered on the 10 May British Foreign Secretary Beckett argued  that climate driven conflicts were already occurring. She referred in particular  to an underlying struggle between nomadic and pastoral communities in  Darfur for ever diminishing feed and water. She also referred to an emerging  conflict in Ghana as Fulani herdsmen confront established farmers in order to  access disappearing water and productive land. These resources are  diminishing at a rapid rate as the Sahara desert expands.4   

 Even without producing direct conflict climate change may aggravate violence  of another kind. Instability and despair can be the breeding ground of  extremism. In that context Admiral Joseph Lopez, the former top NATO  commander in Bosnia, views climate change as a potential factor in  perpetuating global terrorism. He has stated: 

 

 “Climate change will provide the conditions that will extend the war on  terror…You have very real changes in natural systems that are most  likely to happen in regions of the world that are already fertile ground  for extremism…In the long term, we want to address the underlying  conditions that terrorists seek to exploit... But climate change prolongs  those conditions. It makes them worse.”5   

 Climate change is not just a problem for the Third World 

  2

 

 Even developed nations will have difficulty coping with more frequent and  more intense storms. The terrible experience of Hurricane Katrina in the  United States is an example of what we and future generations may have to  confront.  

 

 Hurricane Katrina, which hit Louisiana and Mississippi in late August 2005,  was the third-strongest hurricane on record to make the US mainland.  At  least 1,836 people lost their lives in the immediate aftermath and in the  subsequent floods, making it the deadliest US hurricane in almost 80 years.   

 

 Shortly after the hurricane many residents of New Orleans who remained in  the city began looting shops in search of food and water that were not  available elsewhere.   

 Reports of carjacking, murders, thefts, and rapes in New Orleans increased  dramatically. Thousands of National Guard and fully armed federal troops  were mobilized and sent to Louisiana along with numbers of local law  enforcement personnel from across the US who were temporarily deployed to  the state.    

 The repair bill alone totalled some $105 billion making it the costliest natural  disaster in US history.   

 In addition to the massive repair bill, Hurricane Katrina interrupted the supply  of oil and seriously damaged export revenue by crippling transport of the  region’s primary commodities.   

 

 According to the United States Coast Guard approximately twenty offshore oil  platforms went missing, sunk, or had gone adrift.  The local electric utility filed  for bankruptcy protection a month after the Hurricane hit and they cited lower  revenue and storm restoration costs as the primary cause.   

 Prior to the hurricane, this region of the US was responsible for an estimated  one million non-agricultural sector jobs - these were lost almost overnight.  Hundreds of thousands of residents of southern Louisiana and Mississippi,  including nearly everyone who lived in New Orleans, were left unemployed.   No paychecks were being cashed and no money was being spent, and  therefore no taxes were being collected by local governments. The lack of  revenue will limit the resources of the affected communities and states for  years to come.   

 The overall economic impact to Louisiana and Mississippi is estimated to  exceed a total of $150 billion.   

 The Katrina diaster prompted many to ask whether climate change had  played a role.  Headlines in The Los Angles Times read: “Storm turns focus to  global warming” and the New York Times ran similar pieces.  Both cited a  report, published in the respected journal Nature which challenged the  orthodox view that Katrina fitted into long term weather patterns.6

 The alarm bells are now ringing in Australia    

 For these reasons the former US Generals are by no means the only group  calling for climate change to be dealt with as a priority security issue. As well  as the British Foreign Secretary, respected Australian advisors are trying to  shake our Government out of its decade long slumber. 

 

 Doctors Alan Dupont and Graeme Pearman published a report for the  Australian Lowy Institute released in June 2006 which came to many of the  same conclusions as the US Generals.7  Dupont and Pearman warned:   

 "climate change will contribute to destabilising, unregulated population  movements in Asia and the Pacific. Most of these flows are likely to be  internal, but the ripple effects will be felt beyond the borders of the  states most affected, requiring cooperative regional solutions." and;   

 "Where climate change coincides with other transnational challenges to  security, such as terrorism or pandemic diseases, or adds to pre-existing ethnic and social tensions, then the impact will be magnified.”8  

 Ignore such warnings and we risk the security and stability of our region.   

 The particular threat of climate change to the Asia-Pacific   

 As mentioned, there are many reasons for the nations of the Asia-Pacific to  be particularly concerned with climate change. A recent CSIRO report has  also confirmed that the region’s unique characteristics make it highly  susceptible to the projected weather changes. The report gives further  support to the conclusions of the American military officers to which I have  referred.   

 The CSIRO report warns that land will be swallowed up by rising sea levels,  otherwise known as inundation. CSIRO modelling suggests that by the latter  half of the 21st century, a 30-50cm sea-level rise will occur in the Asia-Pacific. 

 This would affect 100,000km of coastline, causing millions or even billions of  dollars in damage and tens of millions of displaced people. The CSIRO have  calculated that a rise in sea levels of half a metre by 2070-2100 would cost  Southeast Asia alone $300 billion in today’s dollar value.9  

 This potential damage is maximised by the geography and population  distribution in many Asia-Pacific countries. For example, approximately  30,000km2 of land is less than 1 metre above sea-level in Bangladesh alone.  This is where most of the country’s population and agriculture is located. The  area makes up 23 percent of GDP of Bangladesh. While Bangladesh is a  dramatic example, it is far from unique.     

 Even if the sea were to rise less than the predicted 14-32cm in the Pacific by  2050, there would still be devastating results for Pacific islands. The worst  case scenario is total inundation. That is a real prospect faced by Tuvalu 

  4

 along with a significant portion of a number of islands in Vanuatu, Kiribati, the  Marshall Islands, Micronesia and PNG.10    

 Prime Minister Howard - who once prided himself on being able to determine  who comes to our country and the circumstances in which they come - has  some significant questions to answer about climate caused refugees.    

 Dr Jane McAdam Director of Law at the UNSW says the time is rapidly  approaching for the international community to deal with this issue. Dr  McAdam noted that on Christmas Eve of last year the island of Lohachara in  the Bay of Bengal disappeared. She predicted a likely source of refugees from  the Carteret Islands in Papua New Guinea which she forecast are likely to  disappear within a decade.11  

 New Zealand already has a yearly quota of immigrants it accepts from Pacific  Islands at risk of global warming12.  It's difficult to imagine any Government  sending SAS troops out to confront people seeking land lost as a result of  unrestrained industrialisation.   

 Health risks constitute another looming disaster for the Asia-Pacific. Without  action increased temperatures will extend the tropical zones, and with them  tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue. A wider area means a greater  number of potential victims. Heat-related mortality is also capable of claiming  lives. We have seen the ominous example of 300 people dying per day in  Shanghai during a heat surge in the 1980s.13  

 

 The most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has  also identified clean water supply as an endangered resource in the region.  Melting glaciers in the Himalayas are projected to cause flooding, avalanches,  and seriously change the patterns of water supply in Central, South, East and  Southeast Asia.14  This is likely to combine with the increasing lack of fresh  water caused by rising seas in Pacific islands to cause major transformations  to agriculture and population sustainability.   

 Economic damage and loss of opportunity   

 Our region is developing into the economic engine room of the 21st century. It  contains 60 percent of the world’s population, produces around 25 percent of  the global domestic product and contains some of the world’s fastest growing  economies such as China and India. Many of these countries are undergoing  rapid development, population growth and economic expansion which  produces great opportunities and risks for Australia.15

 

 The opportunities are clear. The Asia-Pacific represents 61.3 percent of  Australia’s global trade, amounting to $201.5 billion.16 As regional economies  are given a chance to grow, Australia’s economy can only grow with them.   

 However, all of these growing economies are at risk of eventual downturn if  the threats posed by climate change are not addressed. For example, India 

  5

 and China alone rely on agriculture for 22.7 percent and 15.4 percent of their  GDP respectively.    

 The sustainability of agriculture in both countries is dependent on the wet  seasons or monsoons. Increasing changes to monsoon patterns, and the  problems with water that I have already outlined will require strategic planning  and mitigation strategies to meet the challenge. A failure of crops would not  only result in an inability to feed the rapidly growing population but could also  have negative consequences for economic growth.    

 Increased greenhouse gas emissions are another risk tied up with the rapid  economic development that our regional neighbours are experiencing. The  World Bank predicts that China alone will triple its emissions from 1990 levels  to 2045 tonnes by 2020, making it the world’s largest emitter.17 Carbon  emissions are a driving force behind the changed weather patterns and other  effects that I described earlier.    

 A decade of denial - the Howard Government’s reaction   

 In the face of repeated warnings from those who know far more about the  science and maths of climate change than we politicians, Prime Minister  Howard and his Ministers have staunchly held the line of climate change  scepticism.      

 On the ABC’s Four Corners program on 28 August 2006 the Prime Minister  said:   

 “I accept that climate change is a challenge. I accept the broad theory  about global warming. I am sceptical about a lot of the more gloomy  predictions.”    

 On 20 August 2006 Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane candidly admitted:   

 “I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate  change.”   

 On 22 August 2005 the same Industry Minister told the Four Corners  program:   

 “There is still a degree of uncertainty in the connection between global  warming, which we accept that it appears as though the globe is  warming but only slightly, and whether or not that is entirely or largely  due to human activity. The jury's still out on that.”   

 Malcolm Turnbull, the Minister for the Environment, on 3 February this year  lamented to the ABC’s AM program about what he called “exaggerated  claims” and perhaps raised rather than calmed anxiety when he said:   

  6

 “…because of the geology or the typography of the east coast, you  know, much of that is adequately elevated to deal with a one-metre sea  rise.”   

 Unfortunately this scepticism is producing a lack of motivation from our  Government. That lack of motivation is reflected in the Prime Minster's recent  ‘Rising Australia’ speech of 23 April where he argued that:  

 

 “to say that climate change is the overwhelming moral challenge for  this generation of Australians is misguided at best and misleading at  worse”.     

 All the evidence points to a Government with an incredibly defeatist attitude in  addressing the challenge of climate change to our region and our country.    

 Government decade of inaction despite the world around us   

 The Howard Government’s response to climate change over the last 11 years  has been totally inadequate. At Kyoto the Government obtained concessions  from the international community striving to have as many countries sign up to  the protocol as possible. Under those concessions Australia could actually 

 increase emissions targets of 108 percent of 1990 levels by 2012.    

 Nevertheless, having obtained the concession the Government signed but  refused to ratify the Protocol. With only the US by its side, our Government  has turned its back on all the good work of the international community.    

 Thankfully, the rest of the world has moved on.    

 Since 2000 the European Union has launched over 30 major initiatives to  counter climate change - including laws aimed at improving energy efficiency  in buildings, as well as tax incentives for ‘clean’ transport.18 Across the EU  there is now the world’s largest and most comprehensive carbon emissions  trading scheme. The scheme came into operation in January 2005.19 A 

 second phase commenced at the end of 2005 and will be extended during the  course of this year.   

 In fact, the results of Kyoto can be seen in our region with European Union  initiatives like the Asian Carbon Group - which is applying the financial  mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, in particular the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), to fund power plants across  Asia, both large and small utilizing Renewable Energy Technologies  (RETs).20  

 In 2004, Japan Carbon Finance - the first Green House Gas Reduction Fund  in Asia, was set up in Japan.21  

 The World Bank has estimated that Carbon markets traded US$30 billion  worth of greenhouse gas emission reductions around the world in 2006, an  almost three-fold increase on the previous year’s US$11 billion.22

 The Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger - again, no shrinking  violet or bleeding heart lefty has realised the significance of Climate Change.  California - the 12th largest greenhouse emitter globally - now boasts of  legislation that requires a 25 percent reduction in emission by industries and  residents to cut emissions by 2020.23    

 The Howard Government has watched from afar as our renewable energy  industry moves offshore, and our skills and jobs reduce. A recent prominent  example is that of AGL Energy in March joining the world's first voluntary and  legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction, registry and trading  program.24 This is just another example of business being ahead of  Government on this vitally important issue.   

 Government’s belated and inadequate response   

 In the last 12 months the Government attempted to play catch-up, announcing  Australia’s involvement in the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development  and Climate (AP6) - a delayed and limited response reflecting the  Governments domestic approach to the challenges of climate change.     

 The AP6 initiative has the potential to play an important part in mitigating  climate change - by assisting in the development and deployment of low  emissions technologies - but as stated by the AP6 itself, it is complementary  to the Kyoto Protocol.25  As a standalone measure it falls well short of 

 comprehensive action.    

 The recent IPCC Fourth Assessment Report on Climate Change notes the  achievement of Kyoto and that it has established “new institutional  mechanisms that may provide foundation for future mitigation efforts.”26 A feat  that the Foreign Minister continues to say is ‘fantasy’27. One can only question  how sincere the current Governments belated engagement in finding a  multilateral solution to green house emissions really is.     

 There is now more than ever a heavy economic as well as environmental  argument to get more involved in the international business of climate change.  It is clear that there are excellent initiatives already underway in the region,  and excellent opportunities for Australian business and industry to get  involved.    

 Australia can and should take the lead in enhancing these existing initiatives,  and promoting and developing new ones.   

 However, our diplomatic leverage in this area is being eroded by the  Government’s Kyoto hypocrisy - undermining our capacity and reputation for  proactive climate-change initiatives.   

 It is hypocritical for the Government to declare that climate change requires  global action, Kyoto is flawed and not worth ratifying whilst at the same time  boasting that we are on track to meet our Kyoto targets anyway. 

  8

 

 If that is the case why not just sign Kyoto for the sake of Australia’s  international reputation, regain a seat at the negotiating table and help take a  lead on new international agreements to mitigate global warming?   

 Failure to Ratify Kyoto has Damaged our Reputation and Capacity   

 The Howard Government’s Kyoto recalcitrance has negatively affected our  international reputation.   

 In December 1997 the Irish Times described Australia’s role at the Kyoto  conference as being “something of a pariah”.   Fast forward 10 years and the  news is no better.  

 Sir Nicholas Stern, one of the world's leading authorities on the economics  of climate change says Australia is "seriously damaging" international  efforts to fight global warming.  In March this year Sir Nicholas said:  "People take Australia not signing as a strong statement. It is very often  quoted at me".28  

 Stavros Dimas, the European Environment Commissioner, recently said that  we have “a negative attitude on international negotiations” and stated: “I can  really not understand why Australia has not ratified Kyoto.”29

 

 Former US Vice President Al Gore has dubbed the US and Australia “the  Bonnie and Clyde of the climate debate” and said in September:    

 “I do think that joining the Kyoto process is the key, because that’s  what the rest of the world is doing, and only Australia and the  United States are outside the treaty”.30  

 Internationally renowned environmentalist Dr David Suzuki has described  Australia as “an international outlaw” for failing to ratify Kyoto.31  

 Richard Worthington, South Africa Climate Action Network, said in December  last year:   

 “Of course we would like our government to publicly distance itself from  the Australian rejection of (Kyoto) at every opportunity.”32  

 French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin last year threatened to add an  import tax on Australian goods in protest at Australia’s refusal to sign off on  the Kyoto agreement. 

 

 Even King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden have expressed their  concerns about Australia’s position.33     

 Britain’s Chief Scientist Sir David King; former Japanese Prime Minister  Junichiro Koizumi; his Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi: the Leaders of the  Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Marshall Islands and Tuvalu; and the 

  9

 Kenyan Nobel peace prize winner Wangari Maathai - all have publicly  expressed their concern or given an outright rebuke to our Government.   

 Environmental scientist and 2007 Australian of the Year Tim Flannery warned:   

 "I see the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as being supremely  important, because what's happening at the moment is the Chinese are  citing our recalcitrance as an excuse for them not to do anything."34  

 The Howard Government’s obstructionism is catching   

 Australia’s example to the rest of the world is one of obstruction. It gives cover  to those who are yet to cut emissions but must do so if we are to genuinely  address climate change.   

 The Paris-based International Energy Agency recently said that China’s  economic growth had been so rapid over the past 12 months that it may soon  overtake the US at the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gases.  Previous  predictions were that China would take this dubious honour in 2009 or 2010  but the IEA have suggested it might happen by November this year.   

 Last month Dr Faith Birol, the chief economist at the IEA, predicted that at  current rates within 25 years:   

 “CO2 emissions which come from China alone will be double the CO2  emissions which will come from all the OECD countries put together -  the whole US, plus Canada, plus all the European countries, Japan,  Australia and New Zealand.”35  

 The bad news doesn’t end there.   

 China recently released its first official report on climate change and it flatly  rejected international pressure for Beijing to put emission caps on its factories  and coal power plants.  The Chinese report concluded:   

 “If we prematurely assume responsibilities for mandatory greenhouse-gas emissions reductions, the direct consequence will be to constrain  China’s current energy and manufacturing industries.  Developing the  economy and improving people’s lives remains the country’s primary  task.”36  

 This sounds a lot like John Howard’s prioritisation of the economy over  addressing the world’s number one environmental threat.  The thing is of  course that the economy and the quality of people’s lives - both here and in  China - will be significantly damaged if we fail to take action.     

 The bottom line is that the Government’s climate change scepticism and  obstruction is getting in the way of us helping the world take the next step.  Instead of acting as a Good International Citizen the Howard Government’s 

  10

 refusal to ratify Kyoto is running interference on efforts by the international  community to develop climate change solutions.   

 Howard Government has surrendered but Australia can contribute   

 In the Prime Ministers most recent speech Australia Rising, he stated that:   

 “Australia  emits  fewer  greenhouse  gases  in  a  year  than  the  United   States and China emit in a month.”37  

 This  statement  is  his  justification  for  inaction.  It  is  as  if  he  has  already   surrendered.    

 If anything, those figures warrant a more vigorous determination by all to seek  a global solution. Especially since the Prime Minister neglects to mention that  Australia  is  the  highest  emitter  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  per  capita   amongst OECD countries. 38  

 The  Prime  Minister  is  correct  in  noting  the  importance  of  both  the  United   States and China, and how critical they are to a climate change solution, but  his  legitimisation  of  inaction  essentially  forgets  Australia’s  great  capacity  for   middle-power diplomacy and initiative.   

 Australia is uniquely placed in the region. We have excellent relationships with  both China and the United States.  We have been leaders many regional and  global institutions and initiatives, and we should strive to regain that status. 

 

 Middle power diplomacy and the Montreal legacy   

 In relation to climate change Australia has many past diplomatic initiatives to  be  proud  of  -  none  more  so  than  the  Montreal  Protocol  on  Substances  that   Deplete the Ozone Layer. It remains one of the most effective and successful 

 environmental  protection  agreements.  It  also  established  the  world’s  first   financial  mechanism  to  be  created  under  an  international  treaty  -  the   Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol.39  

 The Hawke Labor Government was a leading supporter of international efforts  to  protect  the  Ozone  layer  in  the  1980’s.  As  such,  Australia  was  closely   involved  with  the  implementation  and  scientific  assessment  aspects  of  the   Montreal  Framework.40  The  2006  UN  Environment  Program/World   Meteorological  Organization  Scientific  Assessment  of  Ozone  Depletion  has   recently reported that as a result of the Montreal Protocol, the total abundance  of ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere has begun to decrease in recent  years.41  

 This  year,  the  International  Polar  Year  and  the  recent  Antarctic  Treaty   Consultative Meeting in Delhi also reminds us of what tools for climate change  we  have  available  to  us  in  our  Antarctic  Territories.  The  Madrid  Protocol,  

 spawned  from  the  Hawke  Labor  Government  has  secured  Australia  a   valuable key to understanding climate change.  

  11

 

 The  Prime  Minister’s  view  that  Australian  action  would  produce  negligible   results is disconnected from our proactive drive and history as a nation, and  our capacity to promote positive diplomatic initiatives. 

 

 All Australians want to be part of solutions, not simply parts of problems. And  given our great tradition of effective and creative middle power diplomacy in   the past, it can be achieved again. 

 

 There is no alternative to immediate action.    

 The CSIRO recently completed a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis,  contrasting the costs of mitigation by 2050 with the benefits of avoided  damages by 2100. Even without considering non-monetary benefits, they 

 concluded that at the very least the costs and benefits would balance out. As  non-monetary factors are taken into account, the balance increasingly shifts  towards taking early action.42  This is supported by other studies which  conclude that abatement measures in the present can yield positive economic  benefits in the long term. This is irrespective of their environment benefits.43    

 Dupont and Pearman have recommended the Howard Government establish  an interdepartmental taskforce to examine the relationships between climate  change and national security. They also advocate mainstreaming the study of  climate change in the Australian Intelligence Community, and taking the lead  in working with like-minded Asia-Pacific governments to examine the  implications of climate change for regional security and stability.44

 

  All of these are valuable suggestions and worthy of consideration as part of a  concerted climate change policy.   

 Engaging business    

 We should be recognising climate change as a major business opportunity for  Australia, instead of seeing it purely in terms of its potential costs.  The global  response to climate change is creating new markets and new industries that  will in time be worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year.   

 As Rod Eddington, former CEO of British Airways and Chair of Labor’s  Council of Business Advisors, said at the Future Summit in Melbourne only  this week:   

 “Business can provide the solution but government must set the  standards.”45  

 The question is whether Australia is positioned to take advantage of these  opportunities.  We need a Government that engages with business and asks  the question: what can we do to sell the move to a low carbon economy as a  massive business opportunity?    

  12

 Why are we not already sending the message to the global community that  Australia aims to be a world leader in climate change knowledge exchange?   There is much to build on.   

 The Australian Business Round Table which includes major Australian  companies like Westpac, BP, Origin Energy, Visy and insurance company  IAG recently have put together a Business Case For Early Action.  They  concluded that not acting on climate change would put at risk:   

 â¢ the $32 billion dollar tourism industry through effects like coral reef  bleaching;  â¢ the $17 billion dollar livestock export industry; and  â¢ the economic future of the entire Murray-Darling Basin - Australia’s 

 food bowl.   

 The Round Table have stated that their commissioned research from the  Allen Consulting Group found that: “it is possible to deliver significant  emission reductions at an affordable cost”.46   

 

 Their CSIRO commissioned studies concluded that:    

 “The economic impacts are significant and widespread, affecting in  particular Australia’s leading export earners, agriculture and tourism.  This will have flow-on effects for the whole economy.”47  

 But most importantly these leading Australian businesses have emphasised  that “the longer we delay action, the more expensive it becomes for business  and for the wider Australian economy”.   

 The choice is clear: we either act on climate change now and mitigate the  economic cost or we delay and the bill gets bigger.    

 Both the financial and security consequences will become more complex and  threatening and the quality of life of our children and grandchildren will be  detrimentally affected.   

 Labor intends to promote a paradigm shift in the way we view climate change.     

 We are aware of the negative consequences of no action, but we should also  be aware that climate change represents a huge positive opportunity for  Australia to lead the global community, that knowledge and technology export  (particularly to China) can reap large profits.   

 A Labor Government can position Australia to be ahead of the rest of the  world and ready to seize this change as an opportunity not as an impediment.   

 But to do this we must ratify Kyoto and regain our international credibility.   

 Regional leadership   

  13

 By adopting measures such as those discussed Australia should be taking a  lead role in our region. We should be setting an example of compliance and  innovation. Instead our example is one of obstruction and criticism of sincere  global effort.   

 Australia  should  foster  and  develop  our  own  carbon  emissions  trading   scheme to facilitate the growth of such technology and industry. We should be  developing  and  distributing  those  technologies  throughout  the  region.  We   need to be ready for the future development of a regional trading system that  has  already  been  discussed  at  various  international  fora  from  APEC  to   ASEAN.   

 Working within the Kyoto framework and assisting the further development of  systems  like  the  Asian  Carbon  Exchange  and  other  Clean  Development   Mechanisms is another step towards a global solution.   

 Australia  should  expand  and  develop  its  scientific  research  into  climate   change utilising the vast wealth of knowledge held deep in the Antarctic ice.  Our  access  and  skills  proximity  are  invaluable  and  vital  to  a  greater  

 understanding of climate change.   

 Dealing with enormous Chinese emission levels that the Prime Minister points  to  and  determining  what  happens  when  it  comes  to  the  post-2012  climate   change regime are vitally important issues for Australia and our region. They  should  be  met  front  and  centre  by  an  Australia  that  moves  forwards  on  the  

 climate change agenda at one with the international community.   

 The Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol will meet from 3 to 14  December in Bali, Indonesia.  This will be the next big chance for the world to  flesh out post-2012 emissions targets.  It will be the international climate 

 change negotiating room right on Australia's doorstep.     

 The key to this room is ratifying the original Kyoto agreement - that's how you  get a seat at the negotiating table.  And given that by December the Federal  Election will have come and passed, the only way for the Australian people to 

 get their hands on that key to the negotiating room is to elect a Labor  Government.     

 So the question to the Australian electorate is now clear: come December this  year do you want to see John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull locked outside  while the world attempts to reach a new climate change consensus?     

 Or do you want to see Kevin Rudd and Peter Garrett in the room, getting on  with the job, looking after our future in cooperation with our international  neighbours and friends?   

 For the world the long-term policy decisions are complex and varied.  But for  Australians the immediate political decision to make is really that simple.
