 The Hon. Scott Morrison MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 

 Operation Sovereign Border, 500 Syrian refugees  to be resettled in Australia, locally engaged  Afghans, Australian Navy celebrations  Friday, 04 October 2013 

 Press Conference, Sydney 

 Joint Press Conference with Scott Morrison - Minister for Immigration and  Border Protection and Air Marshal Mark Binskin - Vice-Chief of the Defence  Force. 

 Scott Morrison: It is our intention to wherever possible hold these weekly, and that  these briefing be held on a Friday or a Monday and obviously subject to the  circumstances and the availability of key personnel. 

 I wish to stress again that at these briefings we will not be going into matters that  may impact upon or otherwise compromise future operations, and so simply outline  that up front again, that if we get into those issues you can anticipate the response  and you may wish to direct your questions to matters where we will be able to  address what you've raised. 

 We're not running a taxi service here or a reception centre. We are running a  military-led border security operation, and as a result the rules and mode of  operations have changed, and this was flagged by the Coalition before the last  election. And today I'm once again joined by the acting Commander of the Operation  Sovereign Borders Joint Agency Task Force, Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Air  Marshal Mark Binskin, and he will provide again a report on the key indicators for this  reporting period and an update of some operational matters. 

 Before then, though, I wish to make a few introductory remarks. Firstly, I wish to  stress that the full arsenal of measures represented in the Coalition's policies to stop  the boats remain available to be deployed by the government. As the Prime Minister  himself said, everything remains on the table. Despite the wishful thinking and  projection by some that I saw in some media reports, there is no change to the  government's policy on border protection. Our resolve, our policies, our commitments  to the task remain as strong and are indeed stronger than ever before. 

 The misrepresentation of Coalition policy positions in the past, and importantly the  correction of those misrepresentations, in particular by the Prime Minister in the past  week, has been a very useful development and it has paved the way for more  measured discussion of these policies with our partners, in particular Indonesia. We 

 have always respected Indonesia's sovereignty in the policy positions we have  taken, and our policies have always been about protecting Australia's sovereignty.  Nothing has changed in that respect. This past reporting period has been dominated  by the extremely successful leaders' meeting between our Prime Minister and the  Indonesian President, where this respect for our sovereignty of both countries was  the key theme. 

 At this meeting the candid, collegial and constructive dialogue that took place has  provided an outstanding platform for Australia and Indonesia to work more closely  together to stop the boats. In Opposition, and in government, the Coalition has  always expressed confidence about our ability to work together with Indonesia on  these issues. The Prime Minister's visit and the generous and proactive response of  President Yudhoyono is early proof of the basis for that confidence. The new  government has acted to remove the sugar from the table, and we welcome the  proactive cooperation from Indonesia and their initiative for more effective liaison. 

 This liaison is underway as we speak, and has been since the government came into  power. The leaders have delegated to myself and Air Chief Marshal Djoko Suyanto  in his capacity of Coordinating Minister for Legal, Security and Political Affairs to now  work through the operational processes that will convert the goodwill and intent of  our leaders into further constructive and collegiate action. 

 My commitment is to work together to establish a broad spectrum of operational  understandings based on no surprises, a deep respect for each nation's sovereignty,  and recognition of our respective obligations and to assist each other through our  partnerships and our joint actions to fulfil these obligations. 

 Our countries have a long history of cooperation on these issues, particularly under a  Coalition Government here in Australia. It was under the Howard Government that  the Bali Process was established with Indonesia. It is under the Abbott Government  that a new Bali-plus model for bilateral cooperation has now been initiated with  President Yudhoyono. There is much work to be done to identify and establish these  operational understandings, but our leaders have made an excellent start and I look  forward to meeting Air Chief Marshal Suyanto, whom I have met before on a  previous visit to Jakarta, in coming weeks. 

 Following the leaders' meeting and conferring with the Prime Minister, the Acting  Commander and I have sent our first team of officials to meet with their counterparts  in Indonesia and that first team is in Jakarta today. They will be followed next week  by a high level delegation led by Acting Commander Binskin including Commissioner  Negus from the AFP and the Prime Minister's special envoy on Operation Sovereign  Borders, Major General Retired Jim Molan, who was formally appointed this week by  the Prime Minister on his return from Jakarta. 

 It will not be our practice to brief on matters discussed at these meetings or the  participants, necessarily, in those meetings. Our dialogue, like our operations, will be  undertaken with Indonesia with total discretion to ensure the success of that  dialogue. They will not - that dialogue, I mean, by undertaken through the media.  Where there are statements agreed for public release, then those statements will be  issued at the appropriate time. What matters here is stopping the boats, not running 

 an operational commentary in the media. So, I'm looking forward to the work ahead  with Air Chief Marshal Suyanto, and there is much work to be done for a very  important purpose. 

 In other matters, I can confirm that I will be visiting Nauru for the first time as Minister  next week, following five previous visits whilst in opposition over the past three  years. It is a place with which I am very familiar. This visit will be similar to my visit to  Papua New Guinea last week. It provides an opportunity to further progress some  operational arrangements with the Government of Nauru, as well as visiting some of  the new facilities and expansion sites and delivering the same blunt message to  those who have been transferred there and that message is quite straightforward -  they will not be getting what they came for, they will not be coming to Australia. 

 To this end, I have also had constructive meetings with the International  Organisation for Migration this week at a regional level about increasing the  participation of the IOM to assist with voluntary returns on both Manus Island and on  Nauru, where there is just one IOM representative [NB: revised to two] at each  location presently. These discussions have also been held at a more senior officials  level at a recent international meeting overseas in New York. We are seeking to  increase the presence of the IOM in both locations as soon as possible. Given the  IOM's clear willingness to assist with voluntary removals, and the importance of their  participation in that process, it is disappointing that the previous government was  unable to facilitate a higher level of participation. Getting people to go home  voluntarily is a critical component of offshore processing, which the previous  government doesn't appear to have built in strongly into their offshore processing  model as a key operational priority. 

 Another key issue being progressed by the JATF is to review internal security at our  facilities as a standard measure to ensure that sufficient resources, processes,  infrastructure and assets are in place and to our satisfaction. Finally, Operation  Sovereign Borders is not just about maritime operations and detention centres. 

 It is about the deterrence and disruption activity undertaken onshore and to break up  the networks of support here in Australia. This activity is led by the Australian  Federal Police under the JATF and I have asked the Acting Commander to provide a  quick and brief report today on some of those issues. 

 I also confirm, based on the report I gave on Monday, the government has now  announced that we will be providing 500 of the 2000 places requested by the  UNHCR to support resettlement of urgent cases in relation to the conflict in Syria.  These places will be drawn from the 13 750 provided under the government's  refugee and humanitarian program. I note that the previous government's policy,  where they had an expanded program of 20 000, only provided 13 000 places for  people other than those who had come to Australia illegally by boat. So of the 20  000, 7000 permanent visas were to be provided this year out of that program for  those who had arrived by boat. 

 I will now hand over to the Acting Commander to provide his report. 

 Mark Binksin: Thank you Minister, and welcome again to the Operation Sovereign  Borders weekly briefing for the period nine o'clock Monday, 30 September, until 0900  this morning. 

 First, I will provide an update on the arrivals transferred to the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection. During the current reporting period, one  suspected illegal entry vessel arrived. On September - on Monday, September 30,  79 PIIs were transferred to the Australian immigration authorities at Christmas  Island. This is the boat that fell outside of the last reporting period, but the one that I  mentioned at last Monday's brief. This vessel did seek assistance from the Australian  authorities on Sunday, and the Royal Australian Navy did go to its aid. And in  addition, during the period, three crew members from that vessel were also  transferred to immigration authorities. 

 With regard to detention and transfer, for the reporting period, a total of 171 people  were transferred to offshore processing centres, 139 to Manus, and 32 to Nauru.  Since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders on 18 September, until  0900 today, a total of 334 arrivals on or after 8 September have been transferred to  offshore processing centres. That tally is up to 115 transferred to Nauru and 219  transferred to Manus. A further 47 people who arrived before 8 September have also  been transferred to offshore processing centres between 18 September and nine  o'clock today. 

 As at nine o'clock today, there are 953 people at Manus and 801 people at Nauru,  with an additional 43 in transit to Nauru. And there were 2263 people at Christmas  Island facilities. Now, all arrivals remain eligible for transfer to offshore processing  centres within the 48 hours rapid transfer system that we have in place. Further  transfers to Manus and Nauru are expected this week, as recent unauthorised  arrivals complete rapid transfer processing and we have sufficient offshore  processing capacity to meet transfer requirements. 

 I will now provide an update on other operational activities during the reporting  period. I'm aware that the Indonesian National Police are vigorously pursuing those  responsible for the tragedy that occurred in West Java last week, which resulted in  the loss of so many lives in that tragedy. The Australian Federal Police are  supporting their Indonesian counterparts, and AFP officers stationed in Indonesia  have travelled to the area to assist. The AFP and Indonesian National Police, or  POLRI, are also cooperating with international partners in Lebanon. The AFP are  also making urgent inquiries in Australia to identify any links to this tragedy. 

 I'm also aware of very successful disruption operations that have occurred in  Indonesia, mainly by the Indonesian authorities. This clearly demonstrates - actually,  all by Indonesian authorities. This clearly demonstrates the close cooperation and  mutual commitment between our two countries to address this issue, and to avoid  tragedies such as the one which occurred in West Java last week. 

 In other activities, the Operation Sovereign Borders joint agency taskforce  headquarters facilities are now complete. The headquarters are based in the  Customs and Border Protection area in Canberra. The majority of the headquarters  staff commenced work there on Tuesday this week. The taskforce has received staff 

 from a wide range of agencies that are contributing to Operational Sovereign  Borders [sic], and we also retain the capability to draw on more resources as  required if we need to do that for operational reasons. And the development of the  strategic plan for border security operations, and the associated regional deterrence  framework, is well underway. 

 So I conclude today's weekly briefing by stating again that what we are involved in  here is a very complex situation and the taskforce is committed to stopping people  smuggling, and the criminals that organise that, and ultimately to saving people's  lives. Thank you. 

 Journalist: Minister, given that the now Prime Minister made a number of comments  before the election saying he was going to start turning boats around within the first  week of coming to office, in what way has the media misrepresented this? 

 Scott Morrison: The Coalition has never had a policy of towing boats back to  Indonesia. That has never been the policy, and that has been the misrepresentation  over a long period of time, despite the myriad corrections that were provided by the  Coalition both in Opposition and in government. So we have had the opportunity,  again, with the Prime Minister's visit, to be very clear about what the Coalition's  policies are about, but, more importantly, to share the common objective of stopping  these boats. 

 And the full plethora of measures that we have available to us are able and ready to  be deployed, but the key issue here is building these operational understandings and  that's what I'll be working constructively with Air Chief Marshall Suyanto to achieve. 

 Journalist: Minister, have there been any suicide or self-harm attempts since the  Coalition came to power? 

 Scott Morrison: Those matters are within the typical reporting arrangements that  come up to us through my own department, and we'll be reviewing those statistics  and we'll come back to you on those arrangements. 

 Journalist: So you don't know if the answer is yes or no? 

 Scott Morrison: No, I said I'll be coming back to you on the release of that  information. 

 Journalist: Minister, have any Syrians been transferred to off shore processing  [indistinct] on Manus or Nauru since you assumed office? 

 Scott Morrison: We don't get into the briefings on the nationalities of those  transferred, or those who arrived. I note also, that even under the government's  previous policy they made no reference to the nationality of those when they  announced arrivals. 

 Journalist: Minister, given these briefings only happen once a week, shouldn't you  know whether self-harm attempts have occurred? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, the presumption of your question is wrong. 

 Journalist: How? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, you are presuming I don't. Next? 

 Journalist: Minister, the previous Minister for Immigration, Tony Burke, says that he  received advice from the Independent Health Committee just before he left office  saying that 48-hour turnaround time, which is your target, for taking them to  processing offshore, would result in inadequate medical assessment. Can you  update us on whether you have received any advice [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: I am totally satisfied about the arrangements we have in place. 

 Journalist: Can you go into detail on the advice that you have been given? 

 Scott Morrison: No. What I will do is tell you that I'm totally satisfied about the  arrangements that we have in place, and all the necessary measures have been put  in place to achieve that. I can also confirm that all the same checks that were being  done under the previous government are being done under this government in  relation to those transfers. I can't speak for the former Minister in terms of what  advice he may or may not receive. You will know it is the convention for incoming  governments - do not have access to briefings provided to previous governments.  What I know is the information that I have, and the decisions that we have made. 

 Journalist: The 500 [indistinct] Syrians, the Labor Government committed to a  thousand. Are you still open to moving toward that number? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, we are in a different part of the operation now, in terms of the  resettlement. The previous government had indicated that for the past year. That  was last financial year. That was my understanding and that was actually supported  by the Opposition when we were in Opposition. On this occasion, the UNHCR has  sought 2000 places from the entire global community, and we have provided 500 of  those. 

 Journalist: Minister, you said this morning that Australia will take 800 Afghan  interpreters and their families. Is it true the Immigration Department had been  planning to take 1000? 

 Scott Morrison: We provided sufficient places to deal with the applications and the  expected number of visas required, and if more are required, then you can expect  the government to meet that requirement. But that is our understanding of the  requirement at present. 

 Journalist: Minister, one of the details that was included when you announced  Operation Sovereign Borders was to set up transit centres in the Indonesian  mainland… 

 Scott Morrison: Well, that's not true. We'd never said we were setting up transit  centres in the Indonesian mainland. That was more misreporting. 

 Journalist: So, just a follow-up on that question, 800 you said were being taken in.  There isn't a requirement for more? 

 Scott Morrison: That is my advice at the moment, yes. We have been going  through a fairly meticulous process and this involves not only the interpreters but  also their families. And based on the applications and working with the Defence  Force, we have been able to get to a current position in terms of the number of  applications that have been received. It's our commitment to make sure that all of  those are resolved by end of the year, by the time we withdraw, and when we are in  that position to provide those visas, then our - we will be bringing them here along  with their families. But it is also our commitment and intention not to leave people  behind as well. But it is our understanding at the moment that 800 will more than  meet the need. 

 Journalist: Will those 800 form part of the annual refugee intake? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes. 

 Journalist: Your last trip to Nauru, conducted while you were shadow minister, you  were accompanied by a journalist from the Australian. Are you planning to take a  journalist with you this time? 

 Scott Morrison: No. 

 Journalist: Any particular reason? 

 Scott Morrison: No. 

 Journalist: Don't you think journalists should be able to come and show the  Australian public what it's like there? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, there are commercial flights available. 

 Journalist: Minister, [indistinct] West Papua asylum seekers that were deported to  PNG after transiting there for 48 hours, what legal grounds were they deported there  on? 

 Scott Morrison: They were taken to Papua New Guinea under a memorandum of  understanding between the two governments, which is of some long standing and a  concession agreed between the PNG Government and Australia. 

 Journalist: Is that the 2003 one? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes. 

 Journalist: Because my understanding is that it's got be seven days before it  qualifies. 

 Scott Morrison: There was a concession agreed between the two governments. 

 Journalist: You said there was in this case? 

 Scott Morrison: Mmm- 

 Journalist: Minister, you say there are commercial flights available. The journalists  can't just walk in and have a look around, as we know from media reports in the past. 

 Scott Morrison: I thought you were referring to whether you'd be able to interview  those of us who are going to - if we were to hold a press conference. But the  previous government had a policy of not permitting media to enter these facilities. I  mentioned this morning on commercial radio that I am not of a mind to change that  policy. I'm currently, and have, consulted with people involved in the operations of  these facilities on Manus Island. I'll be doing something similar on Nauru. But there  has been nothing presented to me to date that should suggest that a change of  policy would be in the interests of those people who are held in those centres. 

 Journalist: Minister, does your discussions with the Indonesians include protocols  on turning boats around? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, I'm not going to go into, as I said, what will and will not include  - what I have said is we will be seeking to put together a series of operational  understandings about a whole range of matters. 

 Journalist: Does that include that? 

 Scott Morrison: It includes operational understandings on a whole range of matters. 

 Journalist: Does that mean that they are refusing to negotiate on [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: No, it means that we'll be seeking to come to a set of operational  understandings on a whole range of matters. 

 Journalist: Minister, are you open to reviewing that policy of letting media in, if  evidence is presented to you to the contrary? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, I think I indicated that to date I have seen nothing that would  suggest that that policy being changed would be in the interests of those who are in  those centres. And that is a top priority for me in weighing up these issues. 

 I said this morning that we have no issues with those who have responsibilities and  recognised skills in assessing the conditions in these places. One of the first  meetings I actually had was with Paris Aristotle who had actually been on Nauru,  and I was seeking an early feedback from Paris on what his initial impressions were,  and that's something that I would continue to value. Paris Aristotle is an  extraordinary individual who I have got to know over many years, and he remains on  the advisory group that is around the Nauru Centre, and obviously his views are  taken into account in any decisions we make. 

 Journalist: Does that [indistinct] transfer of family groups to Manus, or is [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: The Coalition's position has always been that Nauru is the principle  place for transfers of families. 

 Journalist: Minister, when the boat that sank off Java last week, were any of the  survivors taken aboard Australian vessels or aircraft in any way? 

 Scott Morrison: I will let the acting commander respond. 

 Mark Binksin: No. 

 Journalist: Minister, with the Afghan interpreters that are going to be accepted, are  they going to be offered a special visa category? 

 Scott Morrison: They'll be coming under the Refugee and Humanitarian Program. 

 Journalist: Can I ask the Commander, you mentioned successful disruption  occurred this week. Does that include buying boats? 

 Mark Binksin: No. What I'm talking about is a broad level of disruptions, not just in  this week, by the way, it's the ongoing cooperation between us and the Indonesian  authorities, and their particular organisations, or their mirror organisations. And I  have to say that the cooperation has been very, very good across the board. And it's  allowing us to tackle what is a serious criminal activity. 

 Journalist: Does that include the reports about the Indonesian military actually  facilitating some of these smuggling efforts? 

 Mark Binksin: I can't comment on what may be an Indonesian issue there, sorry. 

 Journalist: Can you tell us a bit more about the disruptions, what are they…? 

 Mark Binksin: No, I won't go into the operational aspects except to say that the  cooperation and support that we are providing in this case, the Indonesian National  Police, I think is quite good - in fact is very good cooperation between the two  organisations. 

 Journalist: Does it include arrests? 

 Mark Binksin: The Indonesian authorities do arrest people from the cooperative  activities that we have. 

 Journalist: Have they done so in the last time period? 

 Mark Binksin: I won't go into the actual operations right now, but they have led to  arrests. 

 Scott Morrison: Those sort of details have also been reported previously, and  perhaps at a future briefing, when we may be joined by other members of the JATF,  there may be more opportunity to go into some of those issues. Remembering we  have three task groups, one led by the AFP, one led by my department and another 

 led by Border Protection Command, so there are a range of matters across all of  those. 

 Journalist: Minister, going back to the transit centres as we discussed earlier, can  you just reiterate for me, are you categorically saying there were absolutely no plans  to set up transit centres on the Indonesian mainland [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: Well - what you put to me is that it was our policy to put one in  Indonesia and that's what we'd said. Now, we had never said that. What I have said  in that policy is that we would seek to have transit centres, the locations of those we  were never specific about. And it remains our policy to have such centres. What I  said at the start of the briefing is that all of the measures, all of the measures, that  form part of our policy remain part of the arsenal of measures that the government is  prepared and willing to deploy. And that goes across the full spectrum, and in terms  of the question that was asked here previously, matters involving cooperation with  Indonesia on working with local villages and things of that nature, that was always  put forward as a joint operation. 

 Now, by definition, a joint operation requires joint activity and - to the measures that  are undertaken. There was never any suggestion that measures along those lines  would be conducted unilaterally - none whatsoever. But I think that was the  implication of much of the reporting that was put about and how it was  misrepresented. 

 Journalist: Minister, have any boats been turned around since the Coalition was in  office? 

 Scott Morrison: I addressed that at the start of my briefing I address it at every  briefing. We are not commenting on matters that go to prejudicing current or future  operations. 

 Journalist: I don't know which one of you I should ask, [indistinct] Java, but where  are the survivors now? 

 Scott Morrison: From West Java? Look, we are happy to come back to you on that.  Again, that's a matter handled by Imigrasi and the Indonesian authorities. At present,  I mean, their immediate focus was obviously on providing support and assistance to  those who survived that terrible and tragic incident. 

 But we would have to confirm again with the Indonesian officials about where some  of them may have been accommodated, post that tragic incident. It's a matter that  can also equally be raised with the Indonesian authorities because frankly it's a  matter for the Indonesian authorities. The Australian Government has no direct role  in that. 

 Journalist: Can you say whether the Indonesian Government or officials, whether  any party there was offered financial assistance to take those survivors? 

 Scott Morrison: I don't understand. You'll have to be more specific. 

 Journalist: From this end, was there any offer financially towards the Indonesian  Government to take the survivors and to handle the operation and take them back? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, it was in Indonesian waters. It was a complete Indonesian  operation at the end of the day, because it was occurring within their own territory.  So the question is moot. Okay. Last one. 

 Journalist: When asylum seekers are rescued and handed back to Indonesia, do  you classify that as the same thing as turning back the boats? 

 Scott Morrison: What I - again, without going into any specific instances, if people  end up back in Indonesia, they end up back in Indonesia. 

 Journalist: Don't Australians deserve to know when a boat is turned around? 

 Scott Morrison: Australians deserve, and I believe are keen to know, when the  Australian Government delivers on its promise to stop the boats. That's the outcome  that we committed to the Australian people on. That's the outcome we are reporting  to here, at every briefing, and we will continue to do that until they stop. Thanks for  your time. 

 Before I do that, can I wish the Defence Forces, particularly the Navy, all the best for  what should be a tremendous weekend of events for the Navy and this celebration.  I'm sure Sydneysiders and those that have come from all around the country are  looking forward to what will be a great occasion and I wish you and particularly all of  those serving in our Navy all the best for those celebrations. 

 Mark Binksin: Thank you, Minister, and remember there will be a lot of Australian  Navy personnel and international Navy personnel here in Sydney over the weekend  enjoying Sydney. But while we are doing that, there are a lot of men and women who  are out there combating this criminal activity of people smuggling that's going on. So,  we remember them while we are here celebrating what is 100 years. It's a great  anniversary for the Navy. Thank you very much.

 Operation Sovereign Border, 500 Syrian refugees  to be resettled in Australia, locally engaged  Afghans, Australian Navy celebrations  Friday, 04 October 2013 

 Press Conference, Sydney 

 Joint Press Conference with Scott Morrison - Minister for Immigration and  Border Protection and Air Marshal Mark Binskin - Vice-Chief of the Defence  Force. 

 Scott Morrison: It is our intention to wherever possible hold these weekly, and that  these briefing be held on a Friday or a Monday and obviously subject to the  circumstances and the availability of key personnel. 

 I wish to stress again that at these briefings we will not be going into matters that  may impact upon or otherwise compromise future operations, and so simply outline  that up front again, that if we get into those issues you can anticipate the response  and you may wish to direct your questions to matters where we will be able to  address what you've raised. 

 We're not running a taxi service here or a reception centre. We are running a  military-led border security operation, and as a result the rules and mode of  operations have changed, and this was flagged by the Coalition before the last  election. And today I'm once again joined by the acting Commander of the Operation  Sovereign Borders Joint Agency Task Force, Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Air  Marshal Mark Binskin, and he will provide again a report on the key indicators for this  reporting period and an update of some operational matters. 

 Before then, though, I wish to make a few introductory remarks. Firstly, I wish to  stress that the full arsenal of measures represented in the Coalition's policies to stop  the boats remain available to be deployed by the government. As the Prime Minister  himself said, everything remains on the table. Despite the wishful thinking and  projection by some that I saw in some media reports, there is no change to the  government's policy on border protection. Our resolve, our policies, our commitments  to the task remain as strong and are indeed stronger than ever before. 

 The misrepresentation of Coalition policy positions in the past, and importantly the  correction of those misrepresentations, in particular by the Prime Minister in the past  week, has been a very useful development and it has paved the way for more  measured discussion of these policies with our partners, in particular Indonesia. We  have always respected Indonesia's sovereignty in the policy positions we have  taken, and our policies have always been about protecting Australia's sovereignty.  Nothing has changed in that respect. This past reporting period has been dominated  by the extremely successful leaders' meeting between our Prime Minister and the  Indonesian President, where this respect for our sovereignty of both countries was  the key theme. 

 At this meeting the candid, collegial and constructive dialogue that took place has  provided an outstanding platform for Australia and Indonesia to work more closely  together to stop the boats. In Opposition, and in government, the Coalition has  always expressed confidence about our ability to work together with Indonesia on  these issues. The Prime Minister's visit and the generous and proactive response of  President Yudhoyono is early proof of the basis for that confidence. The new  government has acted to remove the sugar from the table, and we welcome the  proactive cooperation from Indonesia and their initiative for more effective liaison. 

 This liaison is underway as we speak, and has been since the government came into  power. The leaders have delegated to myself and Air Chief Marshal Djoko Suyanto  in his capacity of Coordinating Minister for Legal, Security and Political Affairs to now  work through the operational processes that will convert the goodwill and intent of  our leaders into further constructive and collegiate action. 

 My commitment is to work together to establish a broad spectrum of operational  understandings based on no surprises, a deep respect for each nation's sovereignty,  and recognition of our respective obligations and to assist each other through our  partnerships and our joint actions to fulfil these obligations. 

 Our countries have a long history of cooperation on these issues, particularly under a  Coalition Government here in Australia. It was under the Howard Government that  the Bali Process was established with Indonesia. It is under the Abbott Government  that a new Bali-plus model for bilateral cooperation has now been initiated with  President Yudhoyono. There is much work to be done to identify and establish these  operational understandings, but our leaders have made an excellent start and I look  forward to meeting Air Chief Marshal Suyanto, whom I have met before on a  previous visit to Jakarta, in coming weeks. 

 Following the leaders' meeting and conferring with the Prime Minister, the Acting  Commander and I have sent our first team of officials to meet with their counterparts  in Indonesia and that first team is in Jakarta today. They will be followed next week  by a high level delegation led by Acting Commander Binskin including Commissioner  Negus from the AFP and the Prime Minister's special envoy on Operation Sovereign  Borders, Major General Retired Jim Molan, who was formally appointed this week by  the Prime Minister on his return from Jakarta. 

 It will not be our practice to brief on matters discussed at these meetings or the  participants, necessarily, in those meetings. Our dialogue, like our operations, will be  undertaken with Indonesia with total discretion to ensure the success of that  dialogue. They will not - that dialogue, I mean, by undertaken through the media.  Where there are statements agreed for public release, then those statements will be  issued at the appropriate time. What matters here is stopping the boats, not running  an operational commentary in the media. So, I'm looking forward to the work ahead  with Air Chief Marshal Suyanto, and there is much work to be done for a very  important purpose. 

 In other matters, I can confirm that I will be visiting Nauru for the first time as Minister  next week, following five previous visits whilst in opposition over the past three  years. It is a place with which I am very familiar. This visit will be similar to my visit to  Papua New Guinea last week. It provides an opportunity to further progress some  operational arrangements with the Government of Nauru, as well as visiting some of  the new facilities and expansion sites and delivering the same blunt message to  those who have been transferred there and that message is quite straightforward -  they will not be getting what they came for, they will not be coming to Australia. 

 To this end, I have also had constructive meetings with the International  Organisation for Migration this week at a regional level about increasing the  participation of the IOM to assist with voluntary returns on both Manus Island and on 

 Nauru, where there is just one IOM representative [NB: revised to two] at each  location presently. These discussions have also been held at a more senior officials  level at a recent international meeting overseas in New York. We are seeking to  increase the presence of the IOM in both locations as soon as possible. Given the  IOM's clear willingness to assist with voluntary removals, and the importance of their  participation in that process, it is disappointing that the previous government was  unable to facilitate a higher level of participation. Getting people to go home  voluntarily is a critical component of offshore processing, which the previous  government doesn't appear to have built in strongly into their offshore processing  model as a key operational priority. 

 Another key issue being progressed by the JATF is to review internal security at our  facilities as a standard measure to ensure that sufficient resources, processes,  infrastructure and assets are in place and to our satisfaction. Finally, Operation  Sovereign Borders is not just about maritime operations and detention centres. 

 It is about the deterrence and disruption activity undertaken onshore and to break up  the networks of support here in Australia. This activity is led by the Australian  Federal Police under the JATF and I have asked the Acting Commander to provide a  quick and brief report today on some of those issues. 

 I also confirm, based on the report I gave on Monday, the government has now  announced that we will be providing 500 of the 2000 places requested by the  UNHCR to support resettlement of urgent cases in relation to the conflict in Syria.  These places will be drawn from the 13 750 provided under the government's  refugee and humanitarian program. I note that the previous government's policy,  where they had an expanded program of 20 000, only provided 13 000 places for  people other than those who had come to Australia illegally by boat. So of the 20  000, 7000 permanent visas were to be provided this year out of that program for  those who had arrived by boat. 

 I will now hand over to the Acting Commander to provide his report. 

 Mark Binksin: Thank you Minister, and welcome again to the Operation Sovereign  Borders weekly briefing for the period nine o'clock Monday, 30 September, until 0900  this morning. 

 First, I will provide an update on the arrivals transferred to the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection. During the current reporting period, one  suspected illegal entry vessel arrived. On September - on Monday, September 30,  79 PIIs were transferred to the Australian immigration authorities at Christmas  Island. This is the boat that fell outside of the last reporting period, but the one that I  mentioned at last Monday's brief. This vessel did seek assistance from the Australian  authorities on Sunday, and the Royal Australian Navy did go to its aid. And in  addition, during the period, three crew members from that vessel were also  transferred to immigration authorities. 

 With regard to detention and transfer, for the reporting period, a total of 171 people  were transferred to offshore processing centres, 139 to Manus, and 32 to Nauru.  Since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders on 18 September, until 

 0900 today, a total of 334 arrivals on or after 8 September have been transferred to  offshore processing centres. That tally is up to 115 transferred to Nauru and 219  transferred to Manus. A further 47 people who arrived before 8 September have also  been transferred to offshore processing centres between 18 September and nine  o'clock today. 

 As at nine o'clock today, there are 953 people at Manus and 801 people at Nauru,  with an additional 43 in transit to Nauru. And there were 2263 people at Christmas  Island facilities. Now, all arrivals remain eligible for transfer to offshore processing  centres within the 48 hours rapid transfer system that we have in place. Further  transfers to Manus and Nauru are expected this week, as recent unauthorised  arrivals complete rapid transfer processing and we have sufficient offshore  processing capacity to meet transfer requirements. 

 I will now provide an update on other operational activities during the reporting  period. I'm aware that the Indonesian National Police are vigorously pursuing those  responsible for the tragedy that occurred in West Java last week, which resulted in  the loss of so many lives in that tragedy. The Australian Federal Police are  supporting their Indonesian counterparts, and AFP officers stationed in Indonesia  have travelled to the area to assist. The AFP and Indonesian National Police, or  POLRI, are also cooperating with international partners in Lebanon. The AFP are  also making urgent inquiries in Australia to identify any links to this tragedy. 

 I'm also aware of very successful disruption operations that have occurred in  Indonesia, mainly by the Indonesian authorities. This clearly demonstrates - actually,  all by Indonesian authorities. This clearly demonstrates the close cooperation and  mutual commitment between our two countries to address this issue, and to avoid  tragedies such as the one which occurred in West Java last week. 

 In other activities, the Operation Sovereign Borders joint agency taskforce  headquarters facilities are now complete. The headquarters are based in the  Customs and Border Protection area in Canberra. The majority of the headquarters  staff commenced work there on Tuesday this week. The taskforce has received staff  from a wide range of agencies that are contributing to Operational Sovereign  Borders [sic], and we also retain the capability to draw on more resources as  required if we need to do that for operational reasons. And the development of the  strategic plan for border security operations, and the associated regional deterrence  framework, is well underway. 

 So I conclude today's weekly briefing by stating again that what we are involved in  here is a very complex situation and the taskforce is committed to stopping people  smuggling, and the criminals that organise that, and ultimately to saving people's  lives. Thank you. 

 Journalist: Minister, given that the now Prime Minister made a number of comments  before the election saying he was going to start turning boats around within the first  week of coming to office, in what way has the media misrepresented this? 

 Scott Morrison: The Coalition has never had a policy of towing boats back to  Indonesia. That has never been the policy, and that has been the misrepresentation 

 over a long period of time, despite the myriad corrections that were provided by the  Coalition both in Opposition and in government. So we have had the opportunity,  again, with the Prime Minister's visit, to be very clear about what the Coalition's  policies are about, but, more importantly, to share the common objective of stopping  these boats. 

 And the full plethora of measures that we have available to us are able and ready to  be deployed, but the key issue here is building these operational understandings and  that's what I'll be working constructively with Air Chief Marshall Suyanto to achieve. 

 Journalist: Minister, have there been any suicide or self-harm attempts since the  Coalition came to power? 

 Scott Morrison: Those matters are within the typical reporting arrangements that  come up to us through my own department, and we'll be reviewing those statistics  and we'll come back to you on those arrangements. 

 Journalist: So you don't know if the answer is yes or no? 

 Scott Morrison: No, I said I'll be coming back to you on the release of that  information. 

 Journalist: Minister, have any Syrians been transferred to off shore processing  [indistinct] on Manus or Nauru since you assumed office? 

 Scott Morrison: We don't get into the briefings on the nationalities of those  transferred, or those who arrived. I note also, that even under the government's  previous policy they made no reference to the nationality of those when they  announced arrivals. 

 Journalist: Minister, given these briefings only happen once a week, shouldn't you  know whether self-harm attempts have occurred? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, the presumption of your question is wrong. 

 Journalist: How? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, you are presuming I don't. Next? 

 Journalist: Minister, the previous Minister for Immigration, Tony Burke, says that he  received advice from the Independent Health Committee just before he left office  saying that 48-hour turnaround time, which is your target, for taking them to  processing offshore, would result in inadequate medical assessment. Can you  update us on whether you have received any advice [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: I am totally satisfied about the arrangements we have in place. 

 Journalist: Can you go into detail on the advice that you have been given? 

 Scott Morrison: No. What I will do is tell you that I'm totally satisfied about the  arrangements that we have in place, and all the necessary measures have been put  in place to achieve that. I can also confirm that all the same checks that were being  done under the previous government are being done under this government in  relation to those transfers. I can't speak for the former Minister in terms of what  advice he may or may not receive. You will know it is the convention for incoming  governments - do not have access to briefings provided to previous governments.  What I know is the information that I have, and the decisions that we have made. 

 Journalist: The 500 [indistinct] Syrians, the Labor Government committed to a  thousand. Are you still open to moving toward that number? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, we are in a different part of the operation now, in terms of the  resettlement. The previous government had indicated that for the past year. That  was last financial year. That was my understanding and that was actually supported  by the Opposition when we were in Opposition. On this occasion, the UNHCR has  sought 2000 places from the entire global community, and we have provided 500 of  those. 

 Journalist: Minister, you said this morning that Australia will take 800 Afghan  interpreters and their families. Is it true the Immigration Department had been  planning to take 1000? 

 Scott Morrison: We provided sufficient places to deal with the applications and the  expected number of visas required, and if more are required, then you can expect  the government to meet that requirement. But that is our understanding of the  requirement at present. 

 Journalist: Minister, one of the details that was included when you announced  Operation Sovereign Borders was to set up transit centres in the Indonesian  mainland… 

 Scott Morrison: Well, that's not true. We'd never said we were setting up transit  centres in the Indonesian mainland. That was more misreporting. 

 Journalist: So, just a follow-up on that question, 800 you said were being taken in.  There isn't a requirement for more? 

 Scott Morrison: That is my advice at the moment, yes. We have been going  through a fairly meticulous process and this involves not only the interpreters but  also their families. And based on the applications and working with the Defence  Force, we have been able to get to a current position in terms of the number of  applications that have been received. It's our commitment to make sure that all of  those are resolved by end of the year, by the time we withdraw, and when we are in  that position to provide those visas, then our - we will be bringing them here along  with their families. But it is also our commitment and intention not to leave people  behind as well. But it is our understanding at the moment that 800 will more than  meet the need. 

 Journalist: Will those 800 form part of the annual refugee intake? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes. 

 Journalist: Your last trip to Nauru, conducted while you were shadow minister, you  were accompanied by a journalist from the Australian. Are you planning to take a  journalist with you this time? 

 Scott Morrison: No. 

 Journalist: Any particular reason? 

 Scott Morrison: No. 

 Journalist: Don't you think journalists should be able to come and show the  Australian public what it's like there? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, there are commercial flights available. 

 Journalist: Minister, [indistinct] West Papua asylum seekers that were deported to  PNG after transiting there for 48 hours, what legal grounds were they deported there  on? 

 Scott Morrison: They were taken to Papua New Guinea under a memorandum of  understanding between the two governments, which is of some long standing and a  concession agreed between the PNG Government and Australia. 

 Journalist: Is that the 2003 one? 

 Scott Morrison: Yes. 

 Journalist: Because my understanding is that it's got be seven days before it  qualifies. 

 Scott Morrison: There was a concession agreed between the two governments. 

 Journalist: You said there was in this case? 

 Scott Morrison: Mmm- 

 Journalist: Minister, you say there are commercial flights available. The journalists  can't just walk in and have a look around, as we know from media reports in the past. 

 Scott Morrison: I thought you were referring to whether you'd be able to interview  those of us who are going to - if we were to hold a press conference. But the  previous government had a policy of not permitting media to enter these facilities. I  mentioned this morning on commercial radio that I am not of a mind to change that  policy. I'm currently, and have, consulted with people involved in the operations of  these facilities on Manus Island. I'll be doing something similar on Nauru. But there  has been nothing presented to me to date that should suggest that a change of  policy would be in the interests of those people who are held in those centres. 

 Journalist: Minister, does your discussions with the Indonesians include protocols  on turning boats around? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, I'm not going to go into, as I said, what will and will not include  - what I have said is we will be seeking to put together a series of operational  understandings about a whole range of matters. 

 Journalist: Does that include that? 

 Scott Morrison: It includes operational understandings on a whole range of matters. 

 Journalist: Does that mean that they are refusing to negotiate on [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: No, it means that we'll be seeking to come to a set of operational  understandings on a whole range of matters. 

 Journalist: Minister, are you open to reviewing that policy of letting media in, if  evidence is presented to you to the contrary? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, I think I indicated that to date I have seen nothing that would  suggest that that policy being changed would be in the interests of those who are in  those centres. And that is a top priority for me in weighing up these issues. 

 I said this morning that we have no issues with those who have responsibilities and  recognised skills in assessing the conditions in these places. One of the first  meetings I actually had was with Paris Aristotle who had actually been on Nauru,  and I was seeking an early feedback from Paris on what his initial impressions were,  and that's something that I would continue to value. Paris Aristotle is an  extraordinary individual who I have got to know over many years, and he remains on  the advisory group that is around the Nauru Centre, and obviously his views are  taken into account in any decisions we make. 

 Journalist: Does that [indistinct] transfer of family groups to Manus, or is [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: The Coalition's position has always been that Nauru is the principle  place for transfers of families. 

 Journalist: Minister, when the boat that sank off Java last week, were any of the  survivors taken aboard Australian vessels or aircraft in any way? 

 Scott Morrison: I will let the acting commander respond. 

 Mark Binksin: No. 

 Journalist: Minister, with the Afghan interpreters that are going to be accepted, are  they going to be offered a special visa category? 

 Scott Morrison: They'll be coming under the Refugee and Humanitarian Program. 

 Journalist: Can I ask the Commander, you mentioned successful disruption  occurred this week. Does that include buying boats? 

 Mark Binksin: No. What I'm talking about is a broad level of disruptions, not just in  this week, by the way, it's the ongoing cooperation between us and the Indonesian  authorities, and their particular organisations, or their mirror organisations. And I  have to say that the cooperation has been very, very good across the board. And it's  allowing us to tackle what is a serious criminal activity. 

 Journalist: Does that include the reports about the Indonesian military actually  facilitating some of these smuggling efforts? 

 Mark Binksin: I can't comment on what may be an Indonesian issue there, sorry. 

 Journalist: Can you tell us a bit more about the disruptions, what are they…? 

 Mark Binksin: No, I won't go into the operational aspects except to say that the  cooperation and support that we are providing in this case, the Indonesian National  Police, I think is quite good - in fact is very good cooperation between the two  organisations. 

 Journalist: Does it include arrests? 

 Mark Binksin: The Indonesian authorities do arrest people from the cooperative  activities that we have. 

 Journalist: Have they done so in the last time period? 

 Mark Binksin: I won't go into the actual operations right now, but they have led to  arrests. 

 Scott Morrison: Those sort of details have also been reported previously, and  perhaps at a future briefing, when we may be joined by other members of the JATF,  there may be more opportunity to go into some of those issues. Remembering we  have three task groups, one led by the AFP, one led by my department and another  led by Border Protection Command, so there are a range of matters across all of  those. 

 Journalist: Minister, going back to the transit centres as we discussed earlier, can  you just reiterate for me, are you categorically saying there were absolutely no plans  to set up transit centres on the Indonesian mainland [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: Well - what you put to me is that it was our policy to put one in  Indonesia and that's what we'd said. Now, we had never said that. What I have said  in that policy is that we would seek to have transit centres, the locations of those we  were never specific about. And it remains our policy to have such centres. What I  said at the start of the briefing is that all of the measures, all of the measures, that  form part of our policy remain part of the arsenal of measures that the government is  prepared and willing to deploy. And that goes across the full spectrum, and in terms  of the question that was asked here previously, matters involving cooperation with 

 Indonesia on working with local villages and things of that nature, that was always  put forward as a joint operation. 

 Now, by definition, a joint operation requires joint activity and - to the measures that  are undertaken. There was never any suggestion that measures along those lines  would be conducted unilaterally - none whatsoever. But I think that was the  implication of much of the reporting that was put about and how it was  misrepresented. 

 Journalist: Minister, have any boats been turned around since the Coalition was in  office? 

 Scott Morrison: I addressed that at the start of my briefing I address it at every  briefing. We are not commenting on matters that go to prejudicing current or future  operations. 

 Journalist: I don't know which one of you I should ask, [indistinct] Java, but where  are the survivors now? 

 Scott Morrison: From West Java? Look, we are happy to come back to you on that.  Again, that's a matter handled by Imigrasi and the Indonesian authorities. At present,  I mean, their immediate focus was obviously on providing support and assistance to  those who survived that terrible and tragic incident. 

 But we would have to confirm again with the Indonesian officials about where some  of them may have been accommodated, post that tragic incident. It's a matter that  can also equally be raised with the Indonesian authorities because frankly it's a  matter for the Indonesian authorities. The Australian Government has no direct role  in that. 

 Journalist: Can you say whether the Indonesian Government or officials, whether  any party there was offered financial assistance to take those survivors? 

 Scott Morrison: I don't understand. You'll have to be more specific. 

 Journalist: From this end, was there any offer financially towards the Indonesian  Government to take the survivors and to handle the operation and take them back? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, it was in Indonesian waters. It was a complete Indonesian  operation at the end of the day, because it was occurring within their own territory.  So the question is moot. Okay. Last one. 

 Journalist: When asylum seekers are rescued and handed back to Indonesia, do  you classify that as the same thing as turning back the boats? 

 Scott Morrison: What I - again, without going into any specific instances, if people  end up back in Indonesia, they end up back in Indonesia. 

 Journalist: Don't Australians deserve to know when a boat is turned around? 

 Scott Morrison: Australians deserve, and I believe are keen to know, when the  Australian Government delivers on its promise to stop the boats. That's the outcome  that we committed to the Australian people on. That's the outcome we are reporting  to here, at every briefing, and we will continue to do that until they stop. Thanks for  your time. 

 Before I do that, can I wish the Defence Forces, particularly the Navy, all the best for  what should be a tremendous weekend of events for the Navy and this celebration.  I'm sure Sydneysiders and those that have come from all around the country are  looking forward to what will be a great occasion and I wish you and particularly all of  those serving in our Navy all the best for those celebrations. 

 Mark Binksin: Thank you, Minister, and remember there will be a lot of Australian  Navy personnel and international Navy personnel here in Sydney over the weekend  enjoying Sydney. But while we are doing that, there are a lot of men and women who  are out there combating this criminal activity of people smuggling that's going on. So,  we remember them while we are here celebrating what is 100 years. It's a great  anniversary for the Navy. Thank you very much.
