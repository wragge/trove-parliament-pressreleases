 Emergency food aid for Malawi and Mozambique

 Australia will send almost $6.5 million worth of food aid to refugees in Malawi and  Mozambique, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael  Duffy, announced today.

 The Government's decision to provide food aid packages comes at a time when the  current emergency in Mozambique, which is affecting about six million people,  shows little improvement. Malawi has received about 700,000 Mozambican  refugees and the numbers are increasing.

 "Three quarters of the food will be provided to Mozambican people displaced or  affected by the emergency. The remainder will be provided for Mozambican  refugees in Malawi", Mr Duffy said.

 The aid will take the form of 20,000 tonnes of white maize which is the staple and  preferred grain of the region.

 "While Malawi has been a cooperative and willing host to the refugees, it cannot be  expected to support the present refugee burden without significant external  assistance," Mr Duffy said

 Australia's support for refugees in Malawi and Mozambique forms part of the  Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian International  Development
