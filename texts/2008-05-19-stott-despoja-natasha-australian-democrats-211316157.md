 Australia scores a 'C minus' from UN Committee Against Torture   

 Australia scores a 'C minus' from UN Committee Against Torture   

 The Australian Democrats say the Rudd Government has scored a 'C minus' in its most recent  United Nations report card, based on the concluding observations of the Committee Against  Torture released over the weekend.   

 "The Rudd Government has put a positive gloss on the Committee's concluding observations, but  has failed to address some of the Committee's core concerns," Democrats Attorney-General's  spokesperson Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said.   

 "While the Committee praised the Government's apology to the Stolen Generations and the  dismantling of the Pacific Solution, it was far more critical of the appalling rates of Indigenous  incarceration and deaths in custody, and the Government's maintenance of mandatory detention  and processing of asylum seekers in excised 'offshore' processing centres such as Christmas  Island.   

 "The Committee was also heavily critical of Australia's anti-terrorism laws and practices.    

 "This highlights the need for Australia to urgently review its anti-terror laws so that the laws can be  examined as to their adequacy, fairness, respect for human rights and adherence to Australia's  international treaty obligations.    

 "The Democrats have been calling for such an inquiry for almost a year - one off inquiries such as  the Clarke inquiry into the Haneef affair will not be a panacea to the problems inherent in  Australia's counter-terror regime.  "While the Rudd Government should be praised for making an effort to re-engage with the United  Nations, the Committee Against Torture's report shows that the Government has a long way to go  before Australia's reputation as a good international citizen is restored," Senator Stott Despoja  said.
