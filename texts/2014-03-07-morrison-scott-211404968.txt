 78 Days Without A Successful People Smuggling Venture - Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection 

 07-03-2014 -

 The latest weekly update for Operation Sovereign Borders continues to demonstrate the  Government’s full suite of strong border protection policies is stopping illegal boats, with 78  days having now passed since the last successful people smuggling venture to Australia,  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison said today. 

 78 days, or more than 11 weeks, since the last successful people smuggling venture, is  approaching half the entire time the Coalition Government has now been in office - since the  election six months ago. 

 The government’s strong border protection policies, most significantly our maritime  operations to intercept and remove vessels seeking to illegally enter our waters, are proving  to be the most effective deterrent to people smugglers. 

 The previous government not only refused to implement the maritime measures we are  deploying to stop the boats, but they said - like many other commentators - they would never  work. 

 Offshore processing continues to be an important measure to manage those who have  previously illegally arrived by boat, however it no longer represents the front line of our  deterrence operations. Challenges remain in our offshore processing centres, particularly in  relation to advancing decisions and arranging resettlement. The Government is continuing to  work with our partners in PNG and Nauru to achieve greater progress in these areas. 

 On land disruption, through our regional deterrence framework, is also continuing to deliver  results, with recent disruptions and arrests in Sri Lanka and Malaysia being the latest  examples of our partners’ contribution to deterring people smugglers within our region. 

 This cooperation once again demonstrates that strong borders in our region, deliver stronger  borders for Australia. 

 While the government continues the fight against criminal people smugglers it is also  meeting a commitment to restore fairness to our refugee and humanitarian programme, by  offering 11,000 resettlement places to offshore applicants, including an addition 4,000 extra  places in the special humanitarian programme this year. 

 These offshore applicants, including family members of Australian citizens, are often in  desperate situations, facing real persecution. The guaranteed 11,000 places include at least  1,000 places for women at risk. 

 Just as the government is restoring sovereignty and control to our borders, to save lives at sea,   it is also restoring integrity and control to our refugee and humanitarian programme, by  ending the injustice under Labor where more than 15,000 offshore applicants had their  permanent protection visas handed to those who arrived illegally on boats.
