 More Illegal Boat People Sent Back to China MPS 022/2000

 The Government has achieved outstanding results in returning boat people who have arrived illegally from China, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

 "The removal of another 40 boat people this weekend demonstrates the Government's commitment to removing people who have no lawful right to remain in Australia," Mr Ruddock said.

 "In the past four years, 1,452 boat people have arrived illegally from China and 1,447 of those have been returned home.

 "These returns underscore the strong relationship and cooperation that exists between the Australian and Chinese governments and shows the futility of undertaking such a perilous journey.

 "It also shows a joint commitment in the crackdown on the people smuggling trade," Mr Ruddock said.

 All but one of the people being returned to China arrived on Christmas Island in November of last year with the other arriving on an earlier boat.

 "Illegal boat people who have no reason to stay in Australia will be returned as quickly as possible," Mr Ruddock said.

 "These returns should send a clear message that if people believe the lies peddled by the people smugglers they will pay the price when they are sent home to a possible lifetime of debt."

 Mr Ruddock said that people smugglers now faced up to 20-years in jail and fines of up to $220,000. In addition, unauthorised arrivals who are found to be refugees will now only be granted a three-year temporary protection visa instead of gaining permanent residence. This means many people will have to wait up to five years before they can bring other family members to Australia.

 Immigration and Customs officers also now had the power to board and detain boats in international waters suspected of being involved in people smuggling.

 "Australia does not welcome illegal arrivals. Our refugee and humanitarian programs will not be dictated to by people smugglers," Mr Ruddock said.
