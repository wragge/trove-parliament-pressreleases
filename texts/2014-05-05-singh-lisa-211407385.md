 THE HON MARK DREYFUS QC MP  SHADOW ATTORNEY-GENERAL  SHADOW MINISTER FOR THE ARTS  MEMBER FOR ISAACS 

 

 SENATOR THE HON LISA SINGH  SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE  SHADOW ATTORNEY-GENERAL  SENATOR FOR TASMANIA 

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 BRANDIS SHOULD BACK PRIVACY ALERTS    

 Labor has called on the Government to support Senator Lisa Singh’s Private  Senator’s Bill if they are serious about preventing identity crime.    

 Today the Attorney-General released an Australian Institute of Criminology report  into identity crime, showing that one in ten people surveyed had experienced misuse  of their personal information in the past 12 months.    

 In his speech to the CeBIT Conference in Sydney Senator Brandis said:    

 “These findings should be a call to action for us all - and not just to redouble our  efforts to combat identity crime.”    

 “If Senator Brandis was genuine in his efforts to prevent identity crime he would  support Labor’s Private Senator’s Bill Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014,”  Mr Dreyfus said.    

 “Our bill would make it compulsory for corporations and government to notify  Australians if their privacy is breached and their personal details are released without  authorisation.   

 “Alerting Australians when their privacy is breached means consumers have the  opportunity to change their passwords, improve security setting, or cancel credit  cards.”   

 “In opposition, the Coalition supported the Privacy Amendment (Alerts Bill) 2013  which required businesses and government agencies to tell people when their  privacy has been breached,” Senator Singh said.    

 “Unfortunately when given the opportunity the Government failed to support the Bill,  and subsequently it has not passed through the Senate.   

 “In recent times we have seen the great damage that can be done when large  organisations fail to properly protect private information.   

 “While the Department of Immigration released sensitive details on thousands of  asylum seekers, more recently the ACCC has breached the privacy of subscribers to  its product safety and consumer protection alerts.” 

 “If the Government were serious about protecting Australians from online fraud they  would come out in support of our Privacy Alerts Bill and prioritise its passage  through Parliament.”
