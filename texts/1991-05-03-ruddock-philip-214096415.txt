 SPECIAL ASSISTANCE CATEGORY NEEDS CLARIFICATION

 immigration Minister Hand should immediately clarify who  the Government intends to assist under the new Special Assistance  category contained in the 1991/92 Program.

 In his Program Statement of last Wednesday it was made  clear that the new Special Assistance stream would cater for  certain people who did not meet refugee or special humanitarian  criteria.

 In fact the new category has reduced, by 5,300, the planned  places for those having a well-founded fear of persecution or  personalised victimisation. Whilst the new 6,300 Special  Assistance stream is for those considered by the Government to 

 be in special need, what is not clear is who the Government sees  falling into this category.

 If it is intended for Soviet Jewry that should be made  clear. The Opposition would not object to a reasonable program  to assist Jewish people victimised and discriminated against in  the Soviet Union. Such programs have been in place before and  were eliminated by the Labor Party in its new rigid Regulatory 

 regime.

 Speaking on behalf of the Opposition at the recent B'nai  B'rith District 21 Installation, Mr Ruddock saidi-"On behalf of the Opposition I confirm that we would,  in Government, be keen to ensure that the long­

 standing commitment to assist Soviet Jewry, undertaken  by Australia in the past, be resumed without  unnecessary and unhelpful impediments."

 The Government might have in mind that the Program could  assist Kurdish refugees, particularly as the Minister is now  planning to visit Iran and Iraq.

 It may be that he has in mind the Khmer on the border of 

 Thailand, who have been denied resettlement by being categorised  as displaced people.

 From the Minister's statement, it is impossible to know who  will be eligible and on what' basis.

 It is certainly proper to extend eligibility to those who  are unfairly denied entry as refugees or on humanitarian criteria  because of mere technical difficulties in satisfying particular  requirements.  However, the question still needs to be asked, if  these new arrangements are fair and appropriate, why has the 

 total number of refugee and special humanitarian places been  reduced by more than one half?

 The Government will need to be able to demonstate that  those given special assistance have needs that are as compelling  and demanding for resettlements as those who normally satisfy  refugee and special humanitarian criteria.
