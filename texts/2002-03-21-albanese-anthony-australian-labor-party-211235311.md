  THROWN OVERBOARD FOR TELLING THE TRUTH

  The Member for Grayndler and Shadow Minister for Ageing and Seniors, Mr Anthony Albanese, was today suspended from the House of Representatives for 24 hours for refusing to withdraw:

  “Whether  it  is  the  issue  of  Senator  Heffernan’s  disgraceful abuse  of  parliamentary  privilege  and  his  denigration  of Australian  institutions  with  the  assistance  and  support  of  the Prime  Minister,  whether  it  is  the  lies  that  were  told  about children being thrown overboard.”

  (House Hansard, 20 March 2002, p 1534)

  Mr Albanese told Parliament today that, “to retract a statement that one knows to be true is to tell a lie.  I was not prepared to do that.”

  “If the community is to have confidence in our Parliamentary institutions then the truth must be paramount.  Every Australian knows that children were NOT thrown overboard.  Captain Norman Banks of the HMAS Adelaide, Air Marshall Houston and even Admiral Barrie have all confirmed that children were not thrown overboard from SIEV 4.”

  “This is a Government that is without morals or dignity.  Not only were they prepared to vilify and dehumanise asylum seekers; they have encouraged a despicable homophobic attack on a High Court judge.

  “In my own portfolio area of aged care, the Government during last year’s election campaign did not think twice before releasing fictitious aged care bed figures in a conscious effort to deceive older Australians.

  “This is a Government that is prepared to trample over any of our democratic institutions if they become an impediment to their grasp on power.

  “My electorate will be very angry that while I am unable to sit in House of Representatives today, the disgraced Senator Bill Heffernan is allowed to remain in the Senate.

  “This is a Government prepared to defend the dishonourable while silencing those telling the truth,” Mr Albanese concluded.
