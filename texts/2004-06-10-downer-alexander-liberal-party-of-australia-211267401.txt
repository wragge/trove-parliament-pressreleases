 MEDIA RELEASE  

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER  

 

 AA 04 040  10 June 2004 

 More Aid for Refugees and Displaced  People in Sri Lanka  

 Australia is supporting peace-building and post-conflict  rehabilitation efforts in Sri Lanka by providing an additional $10  million to help refugees and displaced people in Sri Lanka.  

 For more than 20 years, civil war ravaged Sri Lanka, claiming over  64,000 lives and leaving up to 1 million people displaced.  

 Following the signing of an indefinite cease-fire agreement between  the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil  Eelam on 22 February 2002, more than 200,000 people returned  home.  

 The humanitarian funding announced today will help returnees re-integrate into Sri Lankan communities and is being channelled  through international organisations, including the United Nations 

 The International Organisation for Migration will receive $3 million  to assist with the return and resettlement of Sri Lankan refugees  from India. This includes providing carpentry, masonry and tailoring  kits to establish livelihoods and credit and training for micro-businesses to generate rural employment. 

 The United Nations Development Program will receive $1 million to  help fund activities under its Transitional Program for Conflict  Affected Areas. Australia's contribution will support the economic  livelihoods of fishing communities in three districts through  improved access to micro-credit and infrastructure development.  

 The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will receive $6 million  for a range of projects that promote the rights of children,  encourage conflict prevention and resolution and provide education  about the dangers of landmines and unexploded ordnance. 

 The funding provided to UNICEF will also assist with the  rehabilitation of schools in conflict-affected areas of the north and  north-east, and provide children with school kits and catch-up  classes for students who have missed out on education because of 

 the fighting. Other UNICEF activities funded by Australia include  back to school campaigns to encourage children to attend school  and support for maternal and child health programs.  

 Today's announcement reflects Australia's commitment to helping  the world's most vulnerable people, including those affected by  disaster and conflict and brings total development assistance to Sri  Lanka in 2003-04 to $24 million.
