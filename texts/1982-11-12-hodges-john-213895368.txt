 DEVELOPMENT OF IMMIGRATION POLICY  

 AND THE LAW

 'i m migr atio n  p o l i c i e s  a n d t h e law - A u s t r a l i a  a n d NORTH AMERICA"

 NEW SOUTH WALES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

 FRIDAY, 12 NOVEMBER, 1982

 TODAY I WILL BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE BASIS OF AUSTRALIA'S 

 IMMIGRATION POLICY.

 FI RST, Î .  IFP ROPGSE TO EXAMINE HOW THAT POLICY ADJUSTS TO 

 CHANGING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

 WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE LABOUR MARKET.

 SECOND, I WILL DISCUSS THE LEGAL IMPLICATION OF POLICY S CHANGES".

 THIRD, I WILL REFER TO THE SCOPE OF MINISTERIAL DISCRETION, 

 OUTLINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW  MECHANISMS AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT.

 AUSTRALIA IS A MIGRANT-RECEIVING COUNTRY, OUR IMMIGRATION  PROGRAM IS BASED ON SOCIAL, HUMANITARIAN, AND ECONOMIC 

 CRITERIA.

 THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY IS NOT TO DISCRIMINATE ON GROUNDS 

 OF RACE, NATIONALITY, ETHNIC ORIGIN, COLOUR OR SEX. IT 

 IS, HOWEVER, A SELECTIVE POLICY, DEVELOPED ON THE BASIS OF 

 BENEFIT TO THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY. MIGRANTS ARE ACCEPTED  FOR FAMILY REUNION, AS REFUGEES, OR IF THEY HAVE SKILLS  OR QUALITIES NEEDED IN AUSTRALIA. REFUGEES ARE ALSO  ACCEPTED IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS.

 EACH YEAR THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES ON THE SIZE OF THE  IMMIGRATION PROGRAM AS PART OF A ROLLING TRIENNIUM. THE 

 FIGURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR REPRESENTS. A TRADE-OFF  BETWEEN SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND 

 SOCIAL FACTORS. IN DOING THIS, IT IS AIMED AT ACHIEVING  A RESPONSIBLE BALANCE BETWEEN ALL OF THE COMPETING PRESSURES. 

 FURTHER, WITHIN THE OVERALL PROGRAM APPROVED BY GOVERNMENT, " 

 THE MINISTER HAS DISCRETION TO ADJUST THE

 INTAKE THROUGH CHANGING POINT SCORES, LIMITING TIME PERIODS 

 OR QUOTAS IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES, REGULATING CHARGES AND FEES,  

 AND OTHER SYSTEM CHANGES.

 THE NEW MIGRANT ENTRY POLICY CAME INTO EFFECT ON 19 APRIL  1982 AFTER A REVIEW OF EXISTING POLICY, AND FOLLOWING MANY 

 CHANGES IN POLICY OVER THE PAST DECADE.  THESE CHANGES  INCLUDED:  .  THE ADOPTION OF A NON-DISCRIMINATORY POLICY IN 

 1973; THE IMPOSITION OF OCCUPATIONAL RESTRICTIONS IN 1974; THE GRADUAL RELAXATION OF THESE OCCUPATIONAL RESTRICTIONS  FOR SOME CATEGORIES OF MIGRANTS AND INTRODUCTION OF A NEW  POLICY IN JANUARY 1979, AND THE ABOLISHMENT OF ASSISTED 

 PASSAGES FOR NON-REFUGEE MIGRANTS FROM MAY 1981.

 THE NEW POLICY COVERS PERMANENT ENTRY INTO AUSTRALIA FOR 

 WHICH VISA ISSUES IN 1982/83 WILL BE AROUND 115,000 TO 

 120,000, FROM OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ENQUIRE OR APPLY  AROUND THE WORLD.

 TOTAL MOVEMENT INTO AND OUT OF AUSTRALIA. . .  IS,. OF COURSE,

 FAR HIGHER. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1981/82 LONG-TERM ARRIVALS  I.E. PEOPLE INTENDING TO STAY OVER ONE YEAR, NUMBER 210,000.

 OF THESE 118,000 WERE NEW SETTLERS, 58,000 AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS 

 RETURNING AFTER LONG-TERM ABSENCES OVERSEAS AND 38,000  VISITORS. DURING THIS PERIOD HOWEVER, ARRIVALS UNDER SHORT­ TERM RESIDENTS WERE WELL OVER 2 MILLION OF WHOM NEARLY 

 1 MILLION WERE OVERSEAS RESIDENTS VISITING AUSTRALIA. .

 IMMIGRATION POLICY CANNOT REMAIN STATIC, BUT MUST BE 

 SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO ADJUST TO SHIFTS IN -THE ECONOMY  AND THE LABOUR MARKET, POLITICAL PRESSURES AND INTERNATIONAL 

 OBLIGATIONS. IT MUST RESPOND TO CHANGING COMMUNITY CONCEPTS  OF HUMANITARIANISM. IT MUST ALSO BE OBJECTIVE IN PROVIDING 

 REASONABLE JUSTICE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN.

 MIGRANT ENTRY TO AUSTRALIA IS ADMINISTERED UNDER THE MIGRATION 

 ACT 1958. DECISIONS REGARDING THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE  MIGRANT INTAKE ARE, HOWEVER, A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT POLICY 

 NOT REQUIRING AMENDMENT TO THE ACT.

 TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY IN POLICY FORMULATION, 

 LET US CONSIDER THE LABOUR MARKET. WHEN THE NEW POLICY WAS

 â¢ 73

 - 3-

 

 BEING DEVELOPED IN 1981, PROSPECTS FOR THE ECONOMY AND 

 EMPLOYMENT WERE REASONABLY BRIGHT, SKILLED TRADESMEN WERE  IN SHORT SUPPLY, ESPECIALLY IN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT REGIONS. 

 SINCE THE, PROSPECTS FOR THE ECONOMY HAVE DETERIORATED AND  THE LABOUR MARKET IS WEAK. .

 THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT THE WAY IN WHICH IMMIGRATION 

 IMPINGES ON THE LABOUR MARKET AND ECONOMY REQUIRES CAREFUL 

 MANAGEMENT. WE TRY TO ENSURE THAT THE SELECTION SYSTEM  ADJUSTS THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE INTAKE ACCORDING 

 TO THE CAPACITY OF THE LABOUR-MARKET TO ABSORB THE INCREASED  SUPPLY OF WORKERS.

 EACH YEAR THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION 

 FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR. THIS IS, IN EFFECT, A CEILING AND NOT  A TARGET, AND IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES THE NUMBERS  OF PEOPLE ENTERING COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS.

 IT IS IMPORTANT TO AVOID RAPID FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INTAKE,  RAPID UPSURGES OR FALLS IN ACTIVITY CAN HAVE DAMAGING EFFECTS 

 ON BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND FORWARD PLANNING.

 SHORT-TERM CONSIDERATIONS MUST, THEREFORE, BE BALANCED BY 

 RECOGNISING THE LONGER TERM BENEFITS OF THE SIMULATION OF 

 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND THE CONTRIBUTION TO NATIONAL ECONOMIC 

 GROWTH.

 ENTRY IS CONTROLLED BY A SYSTEM OF SELECTION AND APPROVAL. 

 GUIDELINES ARE DETERMINED BY THE MINISTER, AND *  IMPLEMENTED 

 BY MIGRATION OFFICERS ..IN.. AUSTRALIA AND AT OVERSEAS POSTS. .

 EACH MIGRATION CATEGORY HAS CONTROLS TO FINE-TUNE SELECTION 

 TO SHORT-TERM NATIONAL ECONOMIC NEEDS. IN THE LABOUR 

 SHORTAGE CATEGORY, WE ESTIMATE THAT 31,000 VISAS WILL BE 

 ISSUED IN 1982/83. IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS CATEGORY 

 THAT THE INTAKE IS ADJUSTED. TO LABOUR MARKET NEEDS. THERE 

 IS ALMOST NO SCOPE WHATEVER FOR UNSKILLED AND SEMI-SKILLED 

 TO BE APPROVED UNDER THE LABOUR SHORTAGE CATEGORY. SIMILARLY, 

 SKILLED WORKERS, WHERE THEIR SKILLS ARE NOT IN DEMAND, ARE

 â¢ ./4

 - 4-

 C

 MOST UNLIKELY TO BE APPROVED. AS THE LABOUR MARKET 

 DETERIORATES, THE APPLICATION OF THE OCCUPATIONAL DEMAND  SCHEDULE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY RIGOROUS TO LIMIT ELIGIBILITY  UNDER THIS CATEGORY. THIS WILL ALSO LEAD TO REDUCED APPLICATIONS 

 UNDER EMPLOYER NOMINATIONS.

 EVEN THOUGH THE INTAKE WILL REDUCE DRAMATICALLY DURING A 

 RECESSION, IT WILL NOT FALL TO ZERO. EVEN IN TIMES OF HIGH  UNEMPLOYMENT, THERE ARE SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN KEY OCCUPATIONS 

 AND REGIONS.  MIGRANTS ARE USUALLY MORE MOBILE AND ARE MORE  WILLING TO MOVE TO WHERE THE JOBS ARE. IN ADDITION, MANY 

 MIGRANTS COME AS BUSINESSMEN AND THUS CREATE EMPLOYMENT.

 IN THE FAMILY REUNION CATEGORY, AROUND 50,000 VISAS WERE  ISSUED IN 1981/82 OF WHICH SOME 26,000 ARE CLOSE FAMILY 

 AND 24,000 BROTHERS/SISTERS AND NON-DEPENDENT CHILDREN.

 FAMILY REUNION IS IMPORTANT FOR SOUND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 

 WITHIN ETHNIC GROUPS.

 QUITE CLEARLY, THE RATE MUST BE CONSTRAINED BY THE 

 CAPACITY OF THE LABOUR MARKET TO ABSORB WORKERS. I SHOULD 

 NOTE HERE THAT EXPECTATIONS AMONG CERTAIN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES 

 EXCEED THE SCOPE OF FAMILY MIGRATION UNDER THE NEW POLICY · INTRODUCED ON 19 APRIL. WITH PRESENT MIGRANT INTAKE LEVELS 

 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ADMIT ALL PERSONS FOR WHOM SPONSORSHIPS 

 ARE LODGED. TO DO SO WOULD REQUIRE THE INTAKE-LEVEL TO BE 

 EXPANDED'CONSIDERABLY. THUS, THE NEW SELECTION CRITERIA ,   CONSTRAIN. THE ENTRY OF DEMAND UNDER THE'.FAMILY MIGRATION  CATEGORY. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY EXTENDING FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS 

 NO FURTHER THAN BROTHERS, SISTERS AND NON-DEPENDENT CHILDREN, AND PROVIDING FAMILY MIGRATION CONCESSIONS IN RETURN FOR  UNDERTAKINGS OF SUPPORT BY SPONSORS, INCLUDING FIRM JOB 

 OFFERS WHERE APPROPRIATE.

 IN THE REFUGEE CATEGORY, SOME 24,000 ARRIVED IN 1981/82.

 AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, WE ACCEPT REFUGEES BECAUSE WE HAVE 

 INTERNATIONAL AND HUMANITARIAN COMMITMENTS. CRITERIA FOR 

 THIS GROUP HAS ALSO BEEN TIGHTENED RECENTLY. "

 ../5

 IN THE INDEPENDENT MIGRATION AND SPECIAL ELIGIBILITY 

 CATEGORY,  WE ESTIMATE 7,000 VISAS WILL BE ISSUED UNDER 

 INDEPENDENT AND 5,000 UNDER SPECIAL IN 1982/83. INDEPENDENT 

 MIGRANTS ARE OUTSTANDING APPLICANTS WITH OCCUPATIONS NOT IN  SHORTAGE. SPECIAL ELIGIBILITY IS GIVEN TO EXCEPTIONAL SPORTING 

 OR CREATIVE TALENTS, AND SELF-SUPPORTING RETIREE.

 A TOPIC OF RECENT CONCERN IS THAT OF MIGRATION FROM NEW 

 ZEALAND. UNDER PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS, NEW ZEALANDERS CAN  COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE. FROM AN IMMIGRATION POINT OF 

 VIEW IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO ALLOW 

 THIS UNRESTRICTED ENTRY AS THE PRACTICE IS DISCRIMINATORY  AND ADDS TO UNEMPLOYMENT. ~ THE JUSTIFICATION IS FOR POLITICAL 

 AND ECONOMIC, RATHER THAN MIGRATION REASONS.

 A PROGRESS REVIEW OF THE NEW POLICY IS PLANNED FOR THE END  OF THIS YEAR. BY THAT TIME, TRENDS IN APPROVAL RATES UNDER 

 THE NEW CRITERIA WILL BE EVIDENT. IN THE COURSE' OF THE 

 REVIEW, CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO ADJUSTING THE POINTS  SYSTEM IF IT IS NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN BARRIERS AGAINST 

 UNSKILLED AND SEMI-SKILLED-WORKERS.  AT THE SAME TIMEy  WE  WOULD SEEK TO UPHOLD THE HUMANITARIAN AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 ON WHICH FAMILY MIGRATION IS FOUNDED.

 NOW I WILL TURN TO THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK ON WHICH THE 

 AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION POLICY IS BASED, AND THE VARIOUS 

 REVEW MECHANISMS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT DECISIONS AFFECTING  MIGRANTS AND THEIR RELATIVES ARE TAKEN PROPERLY IN ACCORDANCE 

 WITH OUR LAW AND STATED POLICY.

 MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC 

 AFFAIRS INCLUDE THE ADMINISTRATION OF 12 ACT OF PARLIAMENT 

 WHICH REGULATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMMIGRATION INTO AUSTRALIA 

 AND NATURALISATION OF ALIENS AND IMMIGRANTS. THE SCOPE OF 

 CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS EXERCISED BY THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT 

 WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS HAS BEEN WELL SETTLED BOTH UNDER 

 INTERNATIONAL LAW AND AUSTRALIAN LAW. IT HAS BEEN A LONG-  ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW' THAT THE" REGULATION

 - 6-

 OF ENTRY OF FOREIGN NATIONALS INTO THE TERRITORY OF A  SOVEREIGN COUNTRY AND THEIR EXPULSION, AS WELL AS THE GRANT 

 OF CITIZENSHIP, FALL WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THAT COUNTRY.

 SPEAKING OF THE POWER TO DEPORT ALIENS IN THE MIGRATION ACT 

 1958, THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT, SIR HARRY GIBBS.  SAID IN THE RECENT POCHI CASE THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT ANY 

 SOVEREIGN LEGISLATURE TO HAVE SUCH A POWER WHICH IS ESSENTIAL 

 TO NATIONAL SECURITY. AS YOU WILL RECALL, LAST OCTOBER THE  HIGH COURT REJECTED IN THIS CASE THE PLAINTIFF'S CHALLENGE 

 TO THE VALIDITY OF SECTION 12 OF THE MIGRATION ACT ON 

 DEPORTATION OF ALIENS. THE HIGH COURT ALSO HELD THAT  NATURALISATION OF AN ALIEN COULD ONLY BE ACHIEVED UNDER  LEGISLATION, THAT IS TO SAY, AN ALIEN CANNOT CEASE TO BE 

 AN ALIEN AND THEREFORE PASSING BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS  POWER, THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ABSORPTION INTO THE AUSTRALIAN  COMMUNITY.

 MANY OF YOU ARE NOT UNFAMILIAR WITH THE LEGISLATION WITHIN 

 MY PORTFOLIO. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE THEME OF THIS SEMINAR,  IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT, I THINK,  TO BRIEFLY MENTION THE 

 MIGRATION ACT," 1958. '

 .THIS ACT, VESTS OFFICERS THE POWER TO GRANT, IN THEIR 

 DISCRETION, AN ENTRY PERMIT TO AN IMMIGRANT. THE DISCRETION  IS TO BE EXERCISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT POLICY 

 AS APPLICABLE FROM TIME TO TIME.

 AN IMMIGRANT WHO ENTERS OR ENTERED AUSTRALIA WITHOUT AN 

 ENTRY PERMIT, BECOMES A PROHIBITED IMMIGRANT UNDER SECTION 6 

 OF THE ACT. HE ALSO BECOMES A PROHIBITED. IMMIGRANT:

 .  WHEN HIS TEMPORARY ENTRY PERMIT IS CANCELLED OR 

 HAS EXPIRED UNDER SECTION 7 UNLESS A FURTHER 

 ENTRY PERMIT APPLICABLE TO HIM COMES INTO FORCE 

 UPON THE CANCELLATION OR EXPIRATION: OR

 .  WHERE, HAVING ENTERED AUSTRALIA AS A PERSON OR 

 A PERSON INCLUDED IN A CLASS OR PERSONSVvWHO ARE 

 EXEMPT UNDER SECTION 8 FROM THE REQUIREMENT OF 

 ENTRY PERMIT', HE CEASES TO BE SUCH A PERSON AND

 /7

 - 7-

 AN ENTRY PERMIT HAS NOT BEEN GRANTED TO HIM 

 SINCE HIS ENTRY.

 AN IMMIGRANT MAY BE DEEMED TO BE A PROHIBITED IMMIGRANT 

 UNDER SECTION 16, IF HE ENTERS AUSTRALIA LEGALLY OR IF 

 HE ENTERS LEGALLY BUT DOES NOT DISCLOSE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT 

 HE IS A CRIMINAL.

 IN PURSUANCE OF SECTION 18, THE MINISTER HAS POWER TO 

 DEPORT A PROHIBITED IMMIGRANT UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THE  ACT.

 THE MINISTER IS ALSO EMPOWERED TO DEPORT AN ALIEN UNDER  SECTION 12, WHERE HE IS CONVICTED OF CERTAIN CRIMES, OR  AN IMMIGRANT UNDER'SECTION 13, WHERE HE IS CONVICTED OF 

 CERTAIN CRIMES WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY. '

 SECTION 14 ALSO ENABLES THE MINISTER TO DEPORT, AFTER A  REPORT BY A COMMISSIONER, AN ALIEN OR AN IMMIGRANT WITHIN  5 YEARS AFTER ENTRY, WHERE HIS CONDUCT HAS BEEN SUCH THAT 

 HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN AUSTRALIA. I SHOULD 

 ADD THAT THE POWER UNDER SECTION 14 HAS NOT BEEN EXERCISED  IN RECENT YEARS.

 INDEED, THE POWERS TO DEPORT UNDER VARIOUS SECTIONS OF 

 THE ACT HAVE BEEN EXERCISED ONLY AFTER' CAREFUL CONSIDERATION 

 BY MY PREDECESSORS AND MYSELF. ONLY WHERE THE INTERESTS  OF THE GENERAL AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY CLEARLY OUTWEIGH THE 

 POSSIBLE HARDSHIP WHICH A DEPORTEE COULD ENSURE THAT A 

 DEPORTATION ORDER IS EXECUTED. IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN  MIND THAT THE GENERAL COMMUNITY INTERESTS INCLUDE THE INTEREST 

 OF THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE DEPORTATION APART FROM THE 

 DEPORTEE HIMSELF, FOR EXAMPLE HIS FAMILY. IT WAS WITHIN 

 THIS SPIRIT THAT I RECENTLY DECIDED TO REVOKE THE DEPORTATION  ORDER AGAINST MR POCHI ON STRONG AND COMPASSIONATE GROUNDS AS 

 THE DEPORTATION COULD HAVE LED TO THE BREAKING UP OF AN 

 AUSTRALIAN FAMILY OF LONG-STANDING.

 DECISIONS UNDER THE MIGRATION ACT - LIKE OTHER DECISIONS 

 UNDER ANY ENACTMENT WITHIN MY PORTFOLIO - WILL BE SUBJECT

 /  8

 - 8- G p ?

 TO INTERNAL REVIEW AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL REVIEW.

 BEFORE DEALING WITH THE REVIEW MECHANISMS HOWEVER, LET ME  POINT OUT THAT EXAMINATION IS UNDER WAY BY MY DEPARTMENT 

 TO IDENTIFY AREAS IN THE MIGRATION ACT THAT COULD NEED  LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION.

 AT THIS STAGE, IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO GO -  

 INTO DETAILS OF POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS TO THE ACT, BUT IT  IS HOPED THAT ACTION COULD BE TAKEN SOME TIME NEXT 

 YEAR FOR THESE PURPOSES..

 ONE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IS THE 

 INCREASE IN THE ADVANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN RECENT 

 WEARS. INDEED, THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS HAS  BEEN GREATLY ENHANCED WITH EXTERNAL REVIEW EITHER TO - 

 MINIMISE THE INCIDENTS OF MALADMINISTRATION, TO RECONSIDER  THE MERITS OF A PARTICULAR CASE OR TO EXAMINE THE LAWFULNESS O 

 OF A GOVERNMENT DECISION. THAT PROTECTION WILL SOON BE 

 EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE WITH THE COMING INTO OPERATION OF THE  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT UNDER WHICH MEMBERS OF THE  AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY HAVE A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO .  

 ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT 

 OF THE COMMONWEALTH. .

 BUT THE EXISTENCE OF EXTERNAL REVIEW AVENUES, WHICH I 

 SHALL REFER TO IN DETAIL LATER, DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY  CREATE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION­

 MAKING PROCESS. RATHER, THE NEED FOR AN AGGRIEVED PERSON 

 TO COME TO A TRIBUNAL OR A COURT FOR REDRESS OR REMEDY  MAY BE INDICATIVE OF THE ABSENCE OF CONFIDENCE.

 IN MY VIEW IT IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO A BETTER DIALOGUE BETWEEN 

 THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS CLIENT COMMUNITY TO HAVE AN IMPROVED 

 INTERNAL REVIEW MECHANISM BUILT INTO THE DECISION-MAKING 

 PROCESS. .

 SUCH AN INTERNAL REVIEW SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE PART OF THE PROCESS 

 BUT INDEPENDENT FROM THE ORIGINAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, WOULD 

 AIM AT ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: NAMELY, .  .

 ../9

 - 9- & :

 -  TO MONITOR FULL COMPLIANCE AT A DEPARTMENTAL .

 LEVEL WITH THE GOVERNMENT POLICY, PROCEDURES AND 

 INSTRUCTIONS,

 - TO PROVIDE AT THE EARLIEST STAGE FULL REASONS FOR 

 ANY ADVERSE DECISION AFFECTING THE APPLICANT 

 CONCERNED, AND

 - TO PROVIDE FOR A FAIR DECISION-MAKING REVIEW SYSTEM.

 SUCH AN INTERNAL REVIEW SYSTEM WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR 

 DEPARTMENTAL DECISIONS MADE UNDER MOST LAW ADMINISTERED  WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. MY DECISIONS OF WHATEVER NATURE  WILL NOT BE REVIEWED IN THE SYSTEM. INTERNAL REVIEW WOULD 

 NOT BE MEANT TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO STATUTORY-BASED EXTERNAL  REVIEW. IT WOULD AIM TO MINIMISE THE NEED TO SEEK EXTERNAL 

 REVIEW IN THAT IT WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE  DECISIONS AND THE CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE 

 DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY IT SEEKS TO SERVE.

 YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE FIRST STEP OF INTERNAL REVIEW 

 WAS TAKEN BY MY COLLEAGUE AND PREDECESSOR, THE HON  IAN MACPHEE MP WHEN HE ANNOUNCED ON 18 JANUARY 1982 THE  ESTABLISHMENT OF AN IMMIGRATION REVIEW PANEL TO INVESTIGATE 

 CERTAIN CASES WITHIN THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED 12 REVIEW 

 RIGHTS, AND:REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE MINISTER FOR HIS FINAL 

 DECISION. ·

 THE IMMIGRATION REVIEW PANEL WHICH HAS BROUGHT INTO THE .  

 REVIEW PROCESS CERTAIN INVALUABLE COMMUNITY INPUT, HAS 

 PLAYED A USEFUL PART IN THE BUILDING-UP OF PUBLIC  CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING DECISIONS OF 

 DEPARTMENTAL OFFICERS.

 THIS INTERNAL REVIEW MECHANISM IS CURRENTLY BEING 

 ASSESSED.

 THIS BRINGS ME TO THE QUESTION OF DEFINING THE SCOPE OF .  

 REVIEW. I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE COSTS OF REVIEW 

 AND PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SHOULD BE COMMENSURATE 

 WITH THE BENEFITS TO. BE DERIVED AND ACCEPTABLE TO. THE ._

 COMMUNITY AT LARGE.  .

 . ./10

 -10

 Î» -

 THERE IS NO POINT IN TRYING TO BUILD UP PUBLIC CONFIDENCE.

 AT A LEVEL OF COSTS THE GENERAL COMMUNITY IS NOT PREPARED 

 TO ENDORSE.  INDEED, IT WOULD BE PARADOXICAL.TO ATTEMPT TO  DO SO. HENCE THE SCOPE OF REVIEW SHOULD NOT BE OPEN-ENDED 

 AND AN ELECTED GOVERNMENT SHOULD, ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL  COMMUNITY, EXERCISE ITS POLICY DISCRETION TO DETERMINE  CATEGORIES OF PERSONS WHO WOULD ENJOY THE RIGHT OF REVIEW. -   I AM EXPLORING, AT THIS STAGE, THE PROPOSAL THAT RIGHT TO 

 INTERNAL REVIEW TO THE IMMIGRATION REVIEW PANEL SHOULD  BE RESTRICTED TO AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS OR PERMANENT RESIDENTS 

 AFFECTED BY AN ADVERSE DECISION. PERSONS NOT HERE LEGALLY  WOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT OF INTERNAL REVIEW.

 INTERNAL REVIEW COULD BRING SATISFACTION TO APPLICANTS AT 

 NO COST TO THEM. ONCE A DECISION IS SHOWN, I BELIEVE, TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON A FAIR AND EQUITABLE BASIS THROUGH'!'

 AN EFFECTIVE CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT 

 AND ITS CLIENTS, THE CAUSE OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHICH OFTEN 

 GIVES RISE TO THE"COMPLAINT MAY BE REMOVED IN THE NORMAL 

 COURSE OF EVENTS.

 INTERNAL REVIEW IS DIRECTED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF  PRIMARY DECISION MAKING. THE BETTER THE SYSTEM WORKS, 

 PARTICULARLY IF WE CAN MOVE SOON TO GIVING ADEQUATE REASONS  FOR ALL DECISIONS AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE LESS THERE WILL 

 BE THE NEED FOR A REVIEW INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL.

 IF AN APPLICANT IS NOT, HOWEVER, SATISFIED WITH THE 

 OUTCOME OF INTERNAL REVIEW OR WHERE HE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO  SEEK INTERNAL REVIEW IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, VARIOUS AVENUES 

 FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW MAY BE AVAILABLE TO HIM, USUALLY AT A COST;1,

 A DISSATISFIED APPLICANT MAY BRING.HIS CASE TO ONE OR MORE 

 OF THE FOLLOWING AVENUES FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW:

 FIRST, THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN'S FUNCTION IS TO 

 INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS ABOUT ALLEGED 1  DEFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION'

 ../li

 -31 -

 BY DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICIALS. HE IS EMPOWERED TO MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS IN RELATION TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION 

 WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF COMPLAINTS AND REPORT THE OUTCOME 

 OF HIS INVESTIGATION, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TO PARLIAMENT.

 THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS FOR HIS INTERVENTION ARE SET OUT 

 IN THE OMBUDSMAN ACT 1975. .

 NEXT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL (AAT), IN  PURSUANCE OF. SECTION 66E OF THE MIGRATION -  ACT,- THE AAT  HAS JURISDICTION TO REVIEW DECISIONS OF THE MINISTER  UNDER SECTIONS 12,.. 13 OR 48 OF THE ACT, AS MENTIONED 

 EARLIER, SECTIONS 12 AND 13 DEAL WITH DEPORTATION OF ALIENS 

 AND IMMIGRANTS. UNDER SECTION 48, THE MINISTER MAY DIRECT 

 A PERSON NOT TO ACT AS AN IMMIGRATION AGENT. WHERE THE 

 AAT HAS JURISDICTION, IT IS EMPOWERED TO REVIEW A DECISION  ON ITS MERITS.

 AT THE END OF OCTOBER, 41 IMMIGRATION CASES WERE BEFORE 

 THE AAT.

 REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL COURT IS ANOTHER AVENUE UNDER THE 

 ADMINISTRATIVE DEICISIONS (JUDICIAL REVIEW) ACT 1977, THE  FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA IS EMPOWERED TO REVIEW THE 

 LAWFULNESS OF CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS MADE BY  MINISTERS OR OFFICERS ACTING UNDER A -COMMONWEALTH ENACTMENT -   AS DEFINED, OTHER THAN DECISIONS EXCLUDED BY SCHEDULE 1 ·

 TO THE ACT. THE ACT DOES NOT COVER DECISIONS BY THE  GOVERNOR-GENERAL.

 THE GROUNDS FOR REVIEW OF A DECISION UNDER THE AD(JR) ACT 

 ARE SET OUT IN SECTIONS 5, 6 and 7 OF THE ACT. IN  PURSUANCE OF SECTION 13 OF THE ACT, A REQUEST FOR A STATEMENT 

 OF REASONS MAY BE MADE IN RELATION TO THE MAKING OF A DECISION 

 FALLING WITHIN SECTION 5 OF THE ACT, OTHER THAN DECISIONS 

 SPECIFIED IN SCHEDULE 2 TO THE ACT. AMONG THE CATEGORIES 

 OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS, EXEMPTED BY SCHEDULE 2 FROM 

 THE OBLIGATION-TO FURNISH A STATEMENT OF REASONS, IF SO  REQUESTED, ARE THE FOLLOWING:

 12

 -12

 (A) DECISIONS TO REFUSE NON-VISA HOLDERS ENTRY PURSUANT 

 TO SECTION 6 OF THE MIGRATION ACT.. THIS EXEMPTION 

 IS RESTRICTED TO DECISIONS MADE AT THE POINT OF  ENTRY TO AUSTRALIA WHERE THE PERSON ENTERING

 DOES NOT HAVE A VISA;

 (B) VISA DECISIONS MADE PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 11A AND

 11B OF THE MIGRATION ACT I.E. RETURN ENDORSEMENTS....

 TO. ALLOW RE ENTRY TO AUSTRALIA.

 (C) DECISIONS RELATING TO DIPLOMATIC OR CONSULAR STATUS  PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 OF THE MIGRATION ACT; AND

 (D) DECISIONS UNDER THE MIGRATION ACT RELATING TO

 PERSONS WHO ENTERED AUSTRALIA WITH DIPLOMATIC -OR CONSULAR STATUS WHERE THE DECISIONS ARE MADE 

 WHEN THE PERSON IS IN AUSTRALIA,

 AT THE END OF OCOTBER, THERE WERE 16 IMMIGRATION CASES  BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT AND THE. HIGH COURT.

 THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IS A RELATIVELY :NEW BODY. THE 

 COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION 

 ACT 1981. THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF THE ACT IS TO ASSIST 

 IN BRINGING COMMONWEALTH LAWS, ACTS AND PRACTICES INTO  CONFORMITY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND "  -  

 POLITICAL RIGHTS AND OTHER DECLARED INTERNATIONAL  INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE DECLARATIONS OF THE RIGHTS OF THE 

 CHILD, THE MENTALLY RETARDED AND DISABLED PERSONS.

 THE COMMISSION IS EMPOWERED, INTER ALIA, TO INQUIRE INTO  ACTS OR PRACTICES THAT MAY BE INCONSISTENT OR CONTRARY TO 

 A HUMAN RIGHT. ITS POWER OF INQUIRY PERMITS IT TO HOLD 

 AN INQUIRY IN SUCH MANNER AS IT THINKS FIT. THE COMMISSION 

 IN ITS DISCRETION MAY DECIDE NOT TO HOLD AN INQUIRY IF SOME 

 OTHER .REMEDY IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE, OR IF THE COMPLAINT 

 COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVELY OR CONVENIENTLY DEALT WITH BY 

 ANOTHER STATUTORY BODY.

 . ./]3

 - 13-

 «r

 THE COMMISSION IS EMPOOWERED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND 

 REPORT AFTER ITS INQUIRY.

 THE COMMISSION HAS COMPLETED ITS REPORT CONCERNING THE  AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP ACT 1948. THE COMMISSION, I UNDERSTAND, 

 IS NOW EXAMINING, FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS POINT OF VIEW, THE 

 MIGRATION ACT 1958. IN THIS CONNECTION I AM GLAD TO STATE  THAT THERE HAS BEEN GOOD AND CLOSE CONSULTATION BETWEEN 

 THE COMMISSION AND.MY DEPARTMENT.

 THIS BRIEF OUTLINE OF EXTERNAL REVIEW AVENUES SHOWS THAT, .

 IN SO FAR AS IMMIGRATION MATTERS ARE CONCERNED, A DISSATISFIED  APPLICANT OR A PERSON AFFECTED BY AN ADVERSE DECISION COULD 

 ALWAYS HAVE HIS CASE REVIEWED EITHER ADMINISTRATIVELY OR  JUDICIALLY OR BOTH.

 IN A FEW WEEKS TIME, ANOTHER AVENUE IS OPENED UP TO HIM  TO' BETTER PROTECT HIS RIGHTS. WHEN THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 

 ACT COMES INTO OPERATION, THERE WILL BE A LEGALLY ENDORSEABLE  RIGHT TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO CERTAIN DOCUMENTS OF MY DEPARTMENT, 

 AND MY OFFICE.. !

 IN MY VIEW, AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE NOT-SO-MANY COUNTRIES â 

 IN THE WORLD THAT HAS A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW SYSTEM OF 

 GOVERNMENT DECISIONS AND HAS, OPENED UP ITS ADMINISTRATION. _ . .

 SO THAT JUSTICE IS NOT ONLY DONE BUT ALSO IS SEEN TO 

 BE DONE BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC,

 IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASISE THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 

 BETWEEN POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.

 MINISTERS, OFFICIALS AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION MUST 

 CONTINUALLY BE AWARE THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY SHOULD BE 

 SUFFICIENTLY RIGID AND UNAMBIGUOUS TO SATISFY THE NEEDS 

 OF ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL CASES. AT THE 

 SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IMMIGRATION POLICY MAKERS MUST ENSURE 

 THAT THE POLICY MAINTAINS FLEXIBILITY IN ITS-CAPACITY -TO -ADJUST THE AGGREGARE INTAKE IN THE LIGHT OF CHANGING SOCIAL, 

 ECONOMIC AND INTERNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AND TO MEET 

 HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS. ,
