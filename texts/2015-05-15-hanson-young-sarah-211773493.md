 HIGHCOURT CHALLENGE TO LAWFULNESS OF OFFSHORE DETENTION    

 The Australian Greens welcome the case filed in the High Court yesterday challenging the lawfulness of  offshore detention.     

 “It is costing taxpayers billions of dollars to keep children locked up in Nauru’s squalid tent prison.    

 “This week’s budget shows the government is spending half a million dollars per person, per year, to detain  men, women and children on Nauru.    

 “The case involving ten families, including a 4 month old baby and a pregnant woman, transferred from  Nauru to Australia for medical assistance and fearful of being returned to Nauru is just one example of  Australia’s horrific treatment of refugees”, Greens immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.    

 “Manus Island and Nauru are not viable solutions, are an international blight on Australia, and rather than  taking a responsible regional lead in this matter the government continues to ignore international human  rights obligations.    

 “Physical and sexual abuse is rife in Australia’s offshore detention centres and no one, especially women  and children, should be sent to them.
