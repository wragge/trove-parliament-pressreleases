 TRANSCRIPT   

 TONY BURKE MP  Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW -  DOMAIN,  SYDNEY.  NSW  10 March 2006   

 TOPIC: ROBERT JOVICIC   

 E& OE PROOF ONLY   

 Tony Burke:   If we are ever going to be given an example of how the Department of  Immigration has become a turnstile of incompetence we’ve been given it today.  They  have spent money deporting Robert Jovicic.  They have spent money housing him in  Serbia.  They have spent money sending experts back and forth.  They have then spent  money to return Robert Jovicic to Australia only to now, that he is here, ask him to apply  for Serbian citizenship.  Let’s make it clear, Robert Jovicic has been in Australia since  the age of two.   He’s now approaching the age of 40.  He has not been a good member of  the community, but he is undeniably Australia’s responsibility.  There is no doubt about  that at all.  He is Australia’s responsibility.   

 What the Government should be doing is allowing him to apply for Australian citizenship  and get on with life.  There’s no end of mistakes he’s made in life and we shouldn’t cover  over that.  But it is still the case that sometime you just have to take responsibility.   That’s not something that Amanda Vanstone has been particularly good at.  But the  wastage of public money while there’s indecision going on in the Department of  Immigration cannot go on.  He has been here since the age of two.  He’s not an  Australian citizen but undeniably he is Australian.   

 Philip Ruddock always wanted to prove that he was tough on refugees.  For reasons I  don’t understand, Amanda Vanstone has decided that she needs to prove that she’s tough  on Australians.  This sort of incompetence can’t continue.     

 Journalist:  Do you think it’s reasonable that the Federal Government continues further- they are saying they will only give the temporary visa because they want to do further  inquiries, do you think that is reasonable?   

 Tony Burke:  To conduct further inquiries is not an unreasonable thing.  But to ask him  to be applying for Serbian citizenship is insane.  He’s had no links with Serbia throughout  his life.  He doesn’t speak Serbian.  The fact that he can be a Serbian citizen is simply an  accident of history.  He’s been here since the age of two and the Government should 

 simply face the realities and allow him to get on with his life and not allow the  uncertainties to continue or allow an end point where he could finish up being stateless.   

 Journalist:  Is there any reason in your mind why the Government would have taken this  decision?   

 Tony Burke:  I don’t think the Government knows why it’s taken this decision.  Each  different path that this has followed has gone in a different direction.  What I think we are  seeing is incompetence and nothing short of it.   

 Journalist:  Can you see any reason why he shouldn’t be allowed to stay in Australia?   

 Tony Burke:  The argument that comes up straight away is: Is it a good thing to have  people who commit crimes in Australia and no it’s not.  And that is a reason why you can  understand people being concerned that Robert is in Australia.  But you still can’t get  over the fact the he’s Australia’s responsibility and that has to be the overwhelming  argument.   

 

 

 END.
