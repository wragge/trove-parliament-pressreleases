 ROXON: Firstly, I would like to say that Labor welcomes the Government’s  decision on the Sammaki Family.  We think this a rare, maybe unusual, but very  deserving decision and compassionate decision and we are pleased that the Government  has decided to let Mr Sammaki stay and we understand that his children will be able to  be reunited with him soon.   

 But really what I want to be able to talk about today is the unfolding of the  developments at Melville Island.   

 Labor is particularly concerned that the Government seems to be covering up what’s  actually going on in this situation.  They keep saying that for operational reasons they  can’t tell us the details, they can’t even tell us where the boat is, but then they are able to  leak selectively information about whether the engine was disabled, whether there were  documents on the boat or not.     

 We are very concerned that the Government should be confident enough to tell the  public what’s actually going on.     

 And we asked the question that if they are confident and so confident that they have  rushed regulations, made laws to excise thousands of Australian islands surely they have  enough information to be able to tell us:  â¢ are these people seeking asylum? 

 â¢ where is the boat?   â¢ where are they from?  â¢ and the sorts of practical details that we are entitled to know.     

 We suspect the only reason they won’t actually tell us all the details is because the  public would judge them according to the information that there is.  That seems the only  explanation to selectively leak material.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you mean by that?   

 ROXON: Well I think that we have seen in the past the Government cover up  information and then leak piece by piece, as they believe it suits them, the story.  Then  when the Labor party or the public are able to piece together the whole story everyone  says well hang on a second we don’t think the Government should have taken that

 action.    

 We demand in this situation that we get the full story and this brings me to the last important point which  is the people smuggling taskforce has apparently been reinstated.  We were told in a briefing by Minister  Vanstone yesterday that the people smuggling taskforce is responsible for operational decisions relating  to the boat off Melville Island, but no one can tell us who is on the people smuggling taskforce, who leads  the people smuggling taskforce or when it previously met.

 If the Government is serious about combatting people smuggling, why wouldn’t this people smuggling  taskforce not operate all the time?   

 It shouldn’t just be meeting when a boat has already arrived if in fact people smuggling has been  involved.   

 It should working to combat it to stop these boats arriving.  We want to know what the people smuggling  taskforce has been doing for the last 12 months and we have not got an answer on that.
