 PRESS RELEASE BY HON. ANDREW PEACOCK, MP

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 CEASEFIRE IN RWANDA

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Andrew Peacock, today said that as the Government's own pre-conditions for contributing troops to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) had now been fulfilled, it could no longer delay taking a position on the issue, the subject of widespread community concern.

 Mr Peacock noted that in the Senate on 6 June, Senator Evans had said that the Government was awaiting two developments before announcing whether or not it would participate in UNAMIR. These

 were the UN arriving at a "workable concept" for peacekeeping operations in Rwanda, together with the brokering by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) of a ceasefire. Both these requirements had now been fulfilled, Mr Peacock said.

 Mr Peacock said that on 8 June, the UN Security Council had formally approved the establishment of an expanded UNAMIR, with a mandate to protect refugees and relief convoys. And press reports today indicated that the OAU Summit in Tunis had negotiated a ceasefire between the interim Government of Rwanda and the Rwanda Patriotic Front. Mr Peacock also noted that in addition to African countries, the Netherlands, Italy and Canada were all reported as being willing to contribute to UNAMIR.

 Mr Peacock said that, far from abating, the widespread concern in Australia about the suffering of innocent civilians in Rwanda was increasing. The failure of the international community to react effectively to the catastrophe in Rwanda had been described

 by UN Secretary General Boutros-Ghali as Â°a scandal" and by South African President Nelson Mandela as "a rebuke to us all". Given that the Government's own pre-conditions for involvement in

 UNAMIR had now been met, the community had a right to know where Australia stood.
