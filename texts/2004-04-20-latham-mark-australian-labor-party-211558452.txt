 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER   

 

 A big country: Australia’s national identity   

 GLOBAL FOUNDATION  WENTWORTH HOTEL  SYDNEY   

 *CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY*   

 I have always believed in Australia as a big country - big in size, big in spirit, big in its  egalitarian  ways.   These  are  the  values  that  will  guide  a  future  Labor  Government.    Always reaching out to our fellow citizens.  Always trying to build a more cohesive and  just  society.   Always  standing  up  for  Australian  independence  and  Australian   sovereignty.   

 Already we have released a wad of policy aimed at achieving these social goals.  Our  Read Aloud program for early childhood development.  Our Aim Higher policy for TAFE  and  university  access.   Our  plan  to  save  bulk  billing  and  establish  a  national  dental   program.   And  to  help  parents  balance  their  work  and  family  commitments,  Labor’s   Baby Care Payment.   

 These are all important programs, important ways of helping people.  They’re part of  what  I  call  the  ladder  of  opportunity:  the  powerful  combination  of  hard  work,  good   families and communities and the civilising role of government services.   

 That’s the core purpose of modern Labor politics: connecting with people and improving  their  daily  lives.   But  we  also  believe  in  an  extra  dimension.   Political  leadership  that   opens up a different sort of dialogue with the Australian people.  A dialogue about how  we define our national purpose and our national identity.  How we see ourselves and  how we hope Australia will be seen by others.   

 For much of last century, this debate was conducted from a position of weakness.  We  were  never  too  sure  of  our  place  in  the  world.   And  never  too  confident  about   Australia’s role and identity.   

 Until  the  1970s,  we  suffered  from  the  cultural  cringe  -  an  assumption  that  our   institutions  and  culture  could  never  be  as  good  as  Europe  or  North  America.   Our

 geography also made us feel vulnerable - searching for security from Asia, instead of  seeing ourselves as a natural part of the region.   

 It also took us a long time to come to terms with our history, the good and the bad of  white  settlement  and  our  relationship  with  Indigenous  Australians.   Even  today,   academics at either end of the political spectrum are still waging the history wars.   

 My  feeling  is  that  the  rest  of  the  country  has  moved  on.   After  the  progressive   economic, social and cultural changes of the last 30 years, Australians have a renewed  faith  in  our  national  identity.   We  have  a  renewed  confidence  in  being  Australian,   drawing strength from the modern Australian story:   

 â¢ The  economic  reforms  of  the  1980s  and  90s  that  drew  us  into  the  world   economy and opened up new opportunities for Australian enterprise.   

 â¢ Our  engagement  with  Asia  under  the  Hawke  and  Keating  Governments  -   finally reconciling Australia’s geography with Australia’s history.   

 â¢ The rebirth of the Australian arts and cultural identity in the 1970s, paving  the way for the international success of our artists and actors today.    

 â¢ And  in  their  own  special  way,  the  extraordinary  success  of  Australian  

 sporting  teams  over  the  past  decade  -  one  of  our  strongest  points  of  identity  and   acclaim overseas.   

 While the odd historian or newspaper columnist still agonises about these things, the  Australian  people  themselves  have  left  the  old  debates  behind.   I  regard  this  as   unequivocally good for our country.   

 A  nation  agonising  about  itself  is a nation held back by the  weight  of  insecurity  and   uncertainty.  Rare among the nations of the world, the Australian character is outward-going  and  confident  -  a  larrikin  streak  among  the  conservatism  of  the  international   community.  But still smart enough, like a Peter Carey or a David Malouf, to conquer  the critics of New York and London.  Now, after decades of doubt and introspection, our  collective character, our identity as a nation, matches this individual profile.   

 The  challenge  for  government  is  to  add  to  this  process,  to  add  to  our  national   confidence and pride.  How do we define and debate the modern Australian identity?   Not  by  telling  the  public  what  to  think.   But  by  moving  forward  with  the  Australian   people themselves, adding to our national success stories and the public dialogue about  them.     

 I want a future Labor Government to contribute to this process.  This is our big country  agenda:   

 â¢ Building a more creative Australia through the power of education.  â¢ Strengthening the foundations of our culturally diverse and pluralistic society.  â¢ Expressing the values of Australian independence and self-reliance.  â¢ And rebuilding our national reputation for egalitarianism - a fair go for all.

 Australian Creativity   

 Our  first  priority  is  to  develop  the  nation’s  creativity,  truly  valuing  the  importance  of   lifelong  learning.   Under  the  current  government,  education  has  been  singled  out  for   budget  cuts.   Under  Labor,  it  will  be  our  heaviest  area  of  social  investment.   When   people think about Australia, I want them to think about the quality of our education  system.   

 Education has always been important for creating the virtues of reason and tolerance.   But now, with so many technological changes, it has become more than a pathway to  social enrichment. It is the key to economic success - for individuals, communities and 

 nations.   

 There  is  a  lot  of  talk  in  the  media  about  the  new  economy.   Its  meaning  is  actually   quite simple.  The things we used to do with our hands are now being done with our  heads.  Jobs based on muscle power and machine power are being replaced by brain  power.   

 And  the  pace  of  change  is  accelerating  all  the  time.   The  education  system  is  being   called on to prepare students for the work of the future, not just the jobs of today.  In  many cases, today’s high school students will be working in positions which have not  yet been conceived, using technologies that have not yet been invented.   

 This  is  a  challenge  for  all  nations,  but  more  so  ours.   In  the  past,  Australia’s  wealth   came out of the ground - from mining, agriculture and property development.  It used  to  be  called  “riding  on  the  sheep’s  back”.   In  the  future,  these  industries  will  still  be   important, but increasingly the wealth of our nation will come out of our minds - from  the skills and insights of the Australian people.  We will need to ride on the back of our  education system.   

 This means setting bold national targets for lifelong learning.  Every infant child must  be the beneficiary of reading programs, making them ready to learn as soon as they are  ready for school - literacy and numeracy for five-year olds.   

 Every  10-year-old  must  be  able  to  log  onto  the  Internet  and  manage  information.    Every  14-year-old  must  find  the  courses  and  settings  which  excite  their  learning   interests and give them a hunger for more education.  Every 17-year-old must be ready  to extend their education into post-secondary qualifications.    

 Every adult must be able to keep on learning for the rest of their lives.  Every education  and  research  institution  must  not  only  be  resourced  for  success,  but  pressured  to   succeed.   Every  teacher  must  be  at  the  peak  of  their  professional  expertise  and   rewarded accordingly.   

 These  are  the  benchmarks  of  a  creative  and  capable  nation.   Our  future  success   depends on investing in all our people, not just the lucky few.   

 But  education  is  not  just  a  matter  of  accessing  learning  institutions.   It  is  also  a   question of how we learn. How we manage information and make the best use of it.

 The  challenge  for  the  education  system  is  to  draw  out  the  learning  interests  and   capabilities of all its students. To give them access to information. And to recognise that  just as intelligence comes in many forms, learning also needs to be fostered in many  ways.     

 Our starting point must be that every student is capable of achieving excellence.  And  our  guiding  philosophy  must  be  to  customise  our  teaching  methods  to  the  needs  of   every  student.   No  student  left  behind.   Equality  and  excellence  through  education  -   that’s something I want all Australians to be able to identify with.   

 

 Multiculturalism   

 A  second  source  of  national  identity  is  our  cultural  diversity.   We  pride  ourselves  on   being a multicultural society - one of the few nations on earth with ethnic diversity but  without ingrained ethnic tensions or violence.   

 Our challenge now is to build on this success, to give new meaning and depth to our  multicultural identity.  Again, this is an area where the Australian people have moved  on.   

 In  the  early  stages  of  multiculturalism  we  spent  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  prove  our   diversity  and  then  celebrate  it.   This  is  still  reflected  in  government  policies  and   programs: multiculturalism as a celebration of diversity for diversity’s sake. 

 

 Most  Australians  no  longer  see  the  need  to  prove  our  ethnic  diversity.   They  are  too   busy  practising  it  and  enjoying  its  benefits.   They  are  already  living  a  life  of  many   cultures.   

 In the communities I visit, multiculturalism is alive.  It’s in our schools, our streets, our  news  and  entertainment,  our  way  of  thinking  about  the  neighbourhood  in  which  we   live.   It’s  always  evolving,  always  creating  new  connections  between  people  and   between cultures.   

 And this is the way it should be.  If we treat  multiculturalism  as  a  static  concept,  as   something frozen in time - each of us pigeon-holed into past habits and past identities  - then inevitably, it will be a policy based more on difference than diversity.  A policy  that  separates  people  from  each  other,  rather  than  bringing  them  together  to  share   each other’s cultures and the goals of a good society.   

 We shouldn’t assume that a person’s culture comes from a narrow set of attitudes and  beliefs, that they are restricted to their nationality-of-origin or ethnic group.  The reality  is  more  complex  and  dynamic,  with  people  picking  and  choosing  from  a  range  of   cultural  influences.   This  is  true  of  many  second-generation  migrants.   They  do  not   necessarily see themselves as “Chinese Australians” or “Greek Australians” but rather,  citizens with a range of interests and identities.   

 Government  policies  and  definitions  of  multiculturalism  need  to  catch  up  with  this   reality.  They should not automatically treat nationality-of-origin as a marker of cultural 

 

  5

 identity.   They  should  recognise  that  multiculturalism  lies,  not  so  much  between   individuals, but within them - the habit of living one’s life through many cultural habits.   

 This should be a unifying idea in Australia’s national identity - a new and realistic way  of thinking about multiculturalism.  In a diverse nation, social cohesion is as important  as  respect  for  difference.   It  provides  the  foundations  by  which  people  of  different   cultural backgrounds can interact and learn from each other.  This is the key to national  progress: our capacity to absorb the best of the world’s cultures and create a stronger  Australia, built on the best of the things we already possess.     

 This is how I think of multiculturalism - a community of communities, bound together  by  our  duty  to  respect  the  law,  to  recognise  the  Indigenous  inhabitants  of  our   continent, to understand our national language (English) and to learn from each other.   As a nation, we have nothing left to prove in this regard.  Our diversity speaks for itself.   The challenge is to modernise our multicultural policies, to make them relevant to our  multicultural identity.   

 

 Australian Sovereignty   

 There’s another issue on which the political class lags behind the Australian people, and  that’s the question of Australian sovereignty.  Part of our national maturity is knowing  we can match it with the world’s best.  The cringe has gone forever - economic, social  and cultural.   

 The Australian character has always been independent and sceptical of authority.  We  are at our best as a nation when we play a questioning role, challenging the status quo  and trying to deliver a fair go.  Scepticism of this kind has served our democracy well.   Politicians who try to take too much power into their own hands are quickly cut down to  size.   

 One of our enduring challenges as a nation is to express these traits in our relationship  with  the  rest  of  the  world.   We  need  to  clearly  assert  Australia’s  interests,  using  our   reputation  for  openness  and  directness  to  good  effect.   I’m  convinced  that  the  

 Australian  people  want  a  more  self-assured  debate  about  our  foreign  policy  and  our   constitutional independence.   

 They  want  to  step  forward  and  confidently  express  their  point  of  view,  rather  than   having  the  issues  determined  by  the  simplistic  labels  of  the  past.   It  is  no  longer   sufficient to define ourselves through the prism of other nations.  It is not a question of  being pro- or anti-British or pro- or anti-American.  The debate must be unequivocally  pro-Australian.   

 This is what I mean by maturity - the self-confidence in our diplomacy to have a clear  sense of Australia’s interests and stand by them.  The Australian people have this sort  of confidence.  They are just waiting for a national government to match them. 

 

 As an Australian nationalist, I take offence at Mr Howard’s depiction of Australia as a  deputy  sheriff.   If  you  truly  love  this  country,  if  you  truly  believe  in  our  national

 potential, you would always position Australia as an equal, never a deputy.  You would  never under-sell Australia’s role.   

 This  is  how  I  see  our  modern  national  identity:  an  equal  place  in  the  world,  firmly   committed to the US Alliance and the United Nations, but also actively engaged in the  Asia-Pacific.   An  outward-looking  and  self-assured  Australia,  always  an  equal  partner   with other nations.   

 The same principle applies to our constitution.  As an Australian nationalist, I want our  Head of State to be one of us - an Australian citizen.     

 When young Australians study hard at school and aspire to important jobs in the future,  I want them to know that every position in this country is within their reach, including  our Head of State.  This is one of the basic tests of Australian independence.   

 I believe the 1999 Republican referendum was lost because the political class got in the  way.  Too many people felt left out of the process for there to be public confidence in  the model on offer.  This is why Labor plans to recommence the process of creating an  Australian Republic - and hand it over to the people themselves.   After all, this is the  true republican ideal.   

 In government this will involve a three-stage process.  An initial plebiscite will ask the  threshold question: do we want to become a republic?  If the majority answers Yes, a  second plebiscite will ask about the most appropriate model.  The people’s choice will  then be put to a formal referendum.   

 No constitutional conventions.  No control by the politicians.  No veto for the powerful.   Instead, real democratic trust in the judgement of the Australian people.   

 This type of Republic will provide a powerful statement of Australian independence, in  which  the  people  themselves  are  sovereign.   It  will  be  an  important  addition  to  our   national pride and identity.   

 

 Australian Equality   

 My  fourth  and  final  area  of  national  identity  is  perhaps  the  most  characteristic  and   unifying of all Australia’s traits: our egalitarianism.   

 Since  the  early  1990s,  the  debate  about  what  our  nation  stands  for  has  been  mainly   about  symbols;  particularly  the  ‘three  Rs’  -  reconciliation,  the  republic  and  refugees.    Instead of being symbols of national unity - as originally conceived - lately these ‘3 Rs’  have  been  used  to  divide  us.   To  get  us  squabbling  amongst  each  other  instead  of   looking at our government and asking what’s happened to our real values - Australian  mateship and opportunity for all.     

 At a time when many Australians worry that our society has become too individualised  and too commercialised, we need to preserve Australia’s egalitarian values.  We need to  take  the  best  of  our  past  -  the  social  habits  of  mateship  -  and  ensure  that  all   Australians, no matter their gender, race or creed, are cared for in the future.

 The institution of mateship reflects both the good and the bad in Australian history.  It  was  forged  out  of  social  necessity,  part  of  the  way  in  which  the  colony  was  settled.    Small  groups  of  men  worked  together  on  the  Australian  frontier,  learning  to  rely  on   each other and look out for each other’s interests.   

 Mateship remains an endearing part of the Australian character.  It is the social habit by  which Australians take each other at face value, irrespective of family and class.  From  mixing together as equals, mates work on the assumption that ‘Jack is as good as his  master’.  They know the value of the fair go and shared responsibility.     

 Traditionally,  mateship  was  an  exclusive  institution,  limited  to  white  men  only.   It   provided equality within the mateship group, but left out the rest of society.  Today our  challenge is to extend the principles of mateship and equality to all Australians.  This is  already happening among younger generations, breaking down the barriers of gender  and race.   

 Labor wants to add to this process, widening the mateship circle - all Australians on the  ladder  of  opportunity.   Often  this  requires  extra  assistance  for  people  and  groups   excluded in the past:   

 â¢ Equal rights and opportunities for women: quality child care, our Baby Care  Payment and no weakening of the Sex Discrimination Act.   

 â¢ Genuine  reconciliation  with  Indigenous  Australia:  a  new  effort  against   Aboriginal poverty and an apology for the Stolen Generations.   

 â¢ And  respect  for  difference  in  our  society:  fairer  treatment  of  same-sex   couples.  And the type of modern, multicultural society I mentioned earlier.   

 To give our egalitarian values new meaning and relevance, we need to reach out to all  Australians.  That’s the type of society Labor believes in: the fair go ethos, not just for  some, but for all.  And in my experience, it’s a belief shared by the Australian people  themselves.   

 Since becoming Federal Labor Leader, I’ve been moving around this vast country, trying  to talk directly to as many people as I can.  Let me tell you what I’ve found.    

 People  haven’t  been  coming  up  to  me  asking  to  give  them  hundred  dollar  notes.    They’ve been urging me to invest in others.  Their hospitals and dental services.  Their  neighbourhood schools.  Their environment.  Getting our young people off drugs and  into training and jobs.  Decent support for the aged and disabled.     

 These Australians know from personal experience that their mates and neighbours are  doing  it  tough.   They  know  we’re  on  the  way  to  becoming  a  permanently  two-tiered   society.  And they know that the argument governments make for not changing course 

 - that there is no alternative - is false.  They know there is a better and fairer way of  running our society.   

 

  8

 Of course, people also want rising living standards, fairer taxes and greater economic  incentive.  That’s natural and proper.  But overwhelmingly, what comes across to me is  that Australians are a caring and warm-hearted people.   

 

 We  like  the  idea  of  the  common  good.   We’re  uneasy  feeling  like  a  country  of   competing  interests,  one  getting  momentarily  ahead  at  the  expense  of  the  other.    Honesty matters to us.  We tell it like it is.  We understand the importance of character.    And while we sometimes lapse into prejudice, we do so with a knowing sense of regret  because we know that we’re better than that.   

 It’s this egalitarian and straight-talking spirit that we need to project if our nation is to  harvest its full potential.  The Australian people are willing.  They just need the national  leadership  and  policies  to  make  it  possible.   For  me,  that’s  our  authentic  national   identity: an Australia forever young and forever fair.   

 

 Conclusion   

 As a nation, our identity and values matter.  They underpin our patriotism and sense of  belonging.   And  we  should  never  hesitate  to  talk  about  them  -  a  public  dialogue  on   national identity.   

 In the past we haven’t done enough of this.  It’s part of the Australian style: we’re not  always comfortable talking about ourselves.  Yet we have a great story to tell the rest  of the world and we should do more of it.   

 It’s the story of a people with a uniquely democratic temper - a habit of mind that is  creative,  inclusive,  fiercely  independent  and  egalitarian.   A  democratic  attitude  that   believes in opportunity for all as the starting point for all our national policies.  A true  social democracy, without doctrine.   

 This democratic temper has served us well in the past.  And in it, I believe, lies the best  hope for our future.  With our population of only 20 million people, we can’t look to the  practices  and  values  of  other  nations  with  60,  200  or  400  million  people  to  provide  

 models for us - culturally or economically.  Only by including everyone in our national  story and proudly asserting who we are and what we believe, can we generate security  and opportunity for our people in the 21st Century.   

 But  before  this  future  can  be  assured,  we  need  one  important  ingredient  -  a   government that reflects the values and best instincts of its people.  That’s my goal - to  give  this  country  a  government  every  bit  as  big  and  warm  hearted  as  the  Australian   people themselves.   A Government as big and generous as the country we love.  That’s  what I hope to achieve through the election of an Australian Labor Government.
