 Rudd Government withholds information on boat arrivals   

  “The Rudd Labor Government seems to be now trying to deny the new surge of people smuggling activity  into Australian waters by withholding information on the latest arrivals,” Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said.   

 “Late yesterday the biggest arrival in the latest surge of boats was announced some four days after it was  intercepted near Ashmore Reef.   

 “Perhaps the Government was embarrassed to admit that while they were dealing with a boat in Western  Australia, its own Navy and Customs were confused and indecisive about actions to be taken with another  asylum seeker boat load of alleged Tamils and Sri Lankans stranded on a reef in the Torres Strait,” Dr  Stone said.   

 “Quite clearly the new renamed Australian Customs and Boarder Protection Authority are battling to  handle the surge in arrivals- some 11 boats since August with at least another 17 interceptions on our  behalf in Indonesia.”   

 “There are new patterns emerging now that the route into Australia has been successfully re- established.  The first seven or eight boats carried no more then 14 or 15 people. We are now seeing each boat come  with a bigger number risking their lives.”   

 “It also seems that these people arriving are spending less time in Indonesia in transit and are leaving  from a wider range of push-off points in the Indonesian Archipelago,” Dr Stone said.   

 “While there seems to be confusion amongst Rudd Ministers as to who is actually responsible for the new  wave of people smuggling, with both Minister Debus and Minister Evans ducking for cover and no sight of  Minister Joel Fitzgibbon at all, the Australian public has taken up the task with most of the recent arrivals  first seen and reported by civilians including children on shore.”   

 “There is also a real concern about the new efforts of people smugglers moving into the Torres Strait,” Dr  Stone said.   

 “Prime Minister Rudd must call his three ministers responsible for Customs, Home Affairs, Border  Protection, Immigration and Defence and read them the riot act. He should demand they do better in  coordination and communication and that they keep the public well informed, after all the public may just  be the ones having to give directions to the latest arrivals wondering where they are, as they come  ashore.”

  Dr Stone said the Rudd Government is clearly in trouble since the slashing of funding for Immigration,  Border Protection and Customs work.   

 “This is not an area for cost cutting, too much is at stake. The Torres Strait for example is the buffer zone  for keeping out deadly new pathogens and pest species.   

 “Clearly the Quarantine Service there, is completely inadequate when a boat of unknown origin and  destination is left landed on a reef for four days.   

 “No one knows where this boat is now. Has it been sunk, burned or towed to the nearest solid land?”   

 “ Nor do we want the Torres Strait to be another cash cow route for the people smugglers who have no  interest in protecting the lives of their customer,” Dr Stone said.
