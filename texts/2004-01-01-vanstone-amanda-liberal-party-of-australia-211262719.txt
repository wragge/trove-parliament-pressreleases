 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Over 12,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants resettled in 2003

 VPS 001/2004

 As Australians we should all take great pride in the fact that we make a major contribution to international humanitarian  resettlement efforts.

 Australia granted visas to some 12,000 refugees and people of humanitarian concern from overseas in 2003 under its  Humanitarian Program.

 Australia is one of a small number of countries which operate an international humanitarian resettlement program and ours is  the third-largest after the United States and Canada.

 Most of the new refugees were from Africa, the Middle East and South West Asia. These regions are considered the  international priority areas for humanitarian resettlement.

 Australia's resettlement efforts have had an increasing focus on Africa, where there are some of the largest concentrations of  refugees in the world.

 In 2003 there was a 45 percent increase in the number of visas granted to people from the African region compared to the  previous year.

 Huge numbers of refugees are stuck in camps in Africa with no prospect of returning home. To many of them, their only hope  is resettlement in a new country.

 Kakuma, a UNHCR camp in Kenya, is a key location from which Australia resettles refugees. Its population of over 82,000  consists mainly of Sudanese refugees, as well as refugees from Burundi, the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Uganda.

 People there are housed in the most basic conditions with limited food and other support services. The heat in the evening  heats up the tin-roofed shelters like an oven and people sleep on thin straw mats on concrete floors and share pit toilets. 

 Australia's Humanitarian Resettlement Program also makes special provision for refugee women who are without support and  in particularly vulnerable situations. Over 400 women were resettled in 2003 under the "woman at risk" element of the  program.

 A small number of people were also resettled in Australia under special arrangements which commenced in 2003 in  conjunction with UNHCR. These provide for "fast track" emergency rescues of people referred by UNHCR who are at  immediate risk of death through refoulement.

 Australia has resettled some 600,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants since the Second World War and, in recent years,  provides some 12,000 new places every year for humanitarian settlement. 

 Australia has benefited enormously from the energy, commitment and diversity which refugees have brought to their new  home.

 Typical of the story of African refugees who have been resettled in Australia in recent years are:

 n a Sierra Leone woman who, together with her husband, was targeted by militia because of their political activities; she fled  to a neighbouring country with her six children after her husband was killed and was resettled to Australia from that country

 n a Sudanese man who narrowly escaped being shot by government forces after being wrongly accused of supporting anti-government rebels; he made his way with his family to a neighbouring country and then spent five years in the Kakuma camp  before being resettled to Australia.

 These stories are part of a booklet titled, "Refugee and Humanitarian Issues - Australia's Response". For copies phone DIMIA  Public Affairs on (02) 6264 2244.
