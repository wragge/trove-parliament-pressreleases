 Introduction 

 Thank you, Eileen [Dr Eileen Pittaway, Director, Centre for Refugee Research], and 

 thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  here  today,  to  contribute  to  this  important  

 conference. 

 It may be somewhat of an understatement to say that refugee policy in this country 

 ignites passions like few other subjects. 

 I can attest that refugee policy is one area of public policy on which almost every 

 Australian has an opinion - invariably a strong one.  And I don’t think Australia is 

 alone in that experience. 

 I  don’t  hesitate  to  say,  however,  that  Australia  has  a  positive  experience  in  the  

 resettlement of refugees over recent decades. 

 We are proud of the fact we have been able to provide refuge to 750,000 people 

 since World War II. 

 But  Australia  has  also,  unquestionably  in  my  view,  benefited  from  the  social,  

 economic and cultural contribution of those refugees over those decades. 

 I’m delighted today to launch a new report which underlines the evidence for that 

 conclusion. 

 Professor Graeme Hugo is with us today and I’m delighted to use this opportunity to 

 launch his in-depth report on the contribution of refugees to our society.

 The Hugo Report  

 Australia’s  Humanitarian  Program  is  something  all  Australians  can  and  should  be  

 proud  of.   Since  1945,  more  than  three-quarters  of  a  million  people  have  found  

 refuge from harm, and a new life, in Australia. 

 As a lifetime residence of Fairfield in Western Sydney, where so many refugees have 

 settled,  I’ve  seen  first-hand  the  challenges  that  many  refugees  have  had  to  

 overcome  and  also  the  benefits  they  have  individually  and  collectively  brought  to  

 Australia. 

 Anecdotally, we’ve long known that refugees and their children have usually turned 

 out to be highly successful members of our society but we haven’t always been able 

 to substantiate this with concrete research. 

 Now, I’m very pleased to say, we have that evidence. 

 My  department  commissioned  Professor  Graeme  Hugo,  from  the  University  of  

 Adelaide,  to  undertake  a  detailed  study  of  the  economic,  social  and  civic  

 contributions of both first and second generation humanitarian entrants. 

 Professor Hugo is one of Australia’s foremost demographers and I am delighted to 

 formally release his report today. 

 I  am  also  releasing  an  accompanying  booklet,  which  summarises  the  findings  of  

 Professor  Hugo’s  research  and  gives  examples  of  humanitarian  entrants  who  have  

 made a significant contribution to our nation. 

  4

 At first, of course, they must overcome the challenges of building a new life within a 

 culture they may know little or nothing about. 

 There  are  many  obstacles  they  must  overcome,  including  usually  learning  a  new  

 language and new ways of doing things. 

 Often  they  have  come  from  situations  of  extended  and  severe  trauma  and  total  

 dislocation. 

 The challenges are great, but they do not face them alone. 

 The  government  provides  a  range  of  settlement  services  to  assist  humanitarian  

 entrants after their arrival in Australia, and we are always seeking new and better 

 ways to help people settle as quickly as possible. 

 Of course, as recent experience in Newcastle has shown, we don’t always get it right 

 - but, where we find shortcomings, we act quickly to remedy them. 

 In his report, Professor Hugo finds that, despite their traumatic experiences prior to 

 coming  to  Australia,  refugees  and  humanitarian  entrants  make  a  significant  and  

 unique contribution to the Australian community. 

 For starters, refugees provide a demographic dividend to Australia, as they have 

 the  youngest  age  profile  of  all  migrant  groups  and  have  the  largest  proportion  of  

 dependent-age children, who will be educated in Australia. 

 They are also the least likely of all migrant groups to permanently leave Australia. 

  5

 Secondly,  there  is  evidence  of  increased  settlement  in  non-metropolitan  areas,  

 creating social and economic benefits for rural and regional communities. 

 So far this program year, around 20 per cent of humanitarian entrants have settled 

 in  regional  areas.   This  is  up  from  10.9  per  cent  in  2004-05  and  17.5  per  cent  in  

 2009-10. 

 By way of example, about 250 refugees have settled in Rockhampton this year and 

 are  working  at  the  local  abattoir,  while  120  others  have  found  jobs  in  horticulture  

 around the Coonawarra region of South Australia. 

 Thirdly,  Professor  Hugo  examined  in  detail  the  labour  market  contribution  of  

 humanitarian entrants.   

 He  acknowledges,  as  does  the  Government,  that  employment  and  participation  by  

 humanitarian entrants is low in the short-term. 

 Given  the cultural,  language  and  economic  barriers  humanitarian  entrants  face,  as  

 well as the traumatic experience of fleeing persecution, this is hardly surprising. 

 There’s no point sugar-coating it.  Institutional barriers to workforce participation - 

 such as a lack of contacts, local experience or recognised qualifications - invariably 

 make getting a job all the more difficult. 

 But, while humanitarian entrants have the lowest incomes of migrant groups and are 

 more likely to work in manual occupations, they play an important role in meeting a 

 definite demand in the Australian labour market. 

  6

 Further, Professor Hugo’s research found that humanitarian entrants’ experiences in 

 the  labour  market  converge,  over  time,  towards  those  experienced  by  the  

 Australian-born population. 

 They catch up. 

 “Sacrifice” is one of the key themes Professor Hugo noted in his research.   

 New humanitarian migrants work hard in low-skill jobs so as to provide their children 

 with  a  chance  to  succeed  in  Australia,  valuing  their  children’s  education  highly.   

 Again, this is something I’ve absorbed at very close quarters for many years. 

 This has resulted in a higher proportion of first and second generation 15-24 year 

 old  humanitarian  entrants  attending  education  institutions  than  the  Australian  

 average. 

 At  the  same  time,  and  very  interestingly,  humanitarian  entrants  also  show  a 

 greater propensity towards entrepreneurial enterprises, setting up their own 

 businesses to a greater extent than other migrant groups. 

 As an example, three of the top five positions in last year’s BRW Rich 200 list, were 

 occupied by people who either came to Australia as refugees or are the children of 

 refugees. 

 But  it  is  not  just  economically  that  humanitarian  entrants  make  an  important  

 contribution to Australia’s social and civic life. 

  7

 Professor  Hugo’s  research  found  that  humanitarian  entrants  volunteer 

 extensively, both in their local communities and more broadly; a contribution that 

 largely goes unnoticed and unquantified in official statistics. 

 Professor Hugo’s research shows us that a resilient spirit and a desire to succeed are 

 common characteristics of humanitarian entrants. 

 I commend this piece of research to you all today.  

 I truly hope that Professor Hugo’s work will go a long way to dispelling some myths 

 and  misconceptions,  and  contribute  to  a  more  informed  conversation  about  

 Australia’s humanitarian entrants. 

 I  do  not  pretend  for  one  second  that  all  is  always  rosy  for  every  humanitarian  

 entrant  to  Australia  and  that,  over  time,  we  can’t  further  improve  our  settlement  

 services.  This is something I’m interested in doing. Professor Hugo’s research helps 

 put those challenges and areas of improvement very much in context. 

 

 Regional Cooperation Framework 

 Of  course,  it  is  for  these  reasons  I  think  Australia  can  afford  to  resettle  more 

 refugees,  and  that  is  what  I  see  as  one  of  the  significant  benefits  of  the  bilateral  

 arrangement entered into by Australia and Malaysia. 

  8

 It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to talk about that agreement 

 and  our  progress  in  progressing  initiatives  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  

 Framework. 

 The  Regional  Cooperation  Framework  was  endorsed  at  the  Fourth  Bali  Process  

 Ministerial Conference in March. 

 This was a significant achievement. 

 The  Bali  Process  brings  together  43  member  countries  -  from  Jordan  to  New  

 Zealand.   It  includes  source,  transit  and  destination  countries,  as  well  as  key  

 international  organisations  such  as  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  

 Refugees and the International Organization for Migration. 

 And  the  Bali  meeting’s  decision  to  implement  a  regional  framework  was  a  very  

 significant step forward. 

 The  framework,  ministers  agreed,  will  be  implemented  through  practical  

 arrangements and will contribute to a sustainable regional approach. 

 This was an important milestone towards enhancing the protection in the Asia-Pacific 

 region and a huge step forward in terms of regional recognition of a problem that, 

 despite what some people may argue, does not begin and end with Australia. 

 In our region, several countries host asylum seekers and refugees.  In some cases in 

 excess of 100,000. 

 

  9

 Although these countries - like Thailand and Malaysia - may not be parties to the 

 Refugees Convention, it is important that we work with these nations to assist with 

 their  very  considerable  caseloads  of  asylum  seekers;  that  we  work  with  those  

 nations and the UNHCR to develop protection outcomes. 

 Some people take the view that asylum seekers are only Australia’s problem when 

 they set foot on Christmas Island. 

 If we are truly engaging in a regional solution, that means considering what we can 

 further do to resettle more asylum seekers from our region.  It means broadening 

 the  conversation  from  just  those  who  arrive  at  Christmas  Island  to  how  we  can  

 remove the incentive for irregular movement by more consistent approaches across 

 our region. 

 Imagine for a moment that someone suggested an arrangement that meant that: 

 (1) Australia would resettle more refugees; 

 (2) we  could  engage  with  partners  like  the  UNHCR  on  more  consistent  

 outcomes for asylum seekers across the region; and 

 (3) we  could  provide  a  significant  disincentive  for  people  making  the  

 dangerous journey by boat. 

 Intuitively,  you  would  think  such  an  agreement  would  achieve  significant  support.   

 And that is exactly what this arrangement achieves. 

  10

 It is important that we ensure that people who travel to Australia by boat are treated 

 in  line  with  our  international  obligations  and  that  they  be  treated  with  dignity  and  

 respect. 

 But this debate should not just be about those who have the money and inclination 

 to make the journey to Australia by boat. 

 There are two groups of forgotten people in this debate. 

 Firstly, there are those who wait for resettlement.  Who do not have the money or 

 inclination to pay a people smuggler. 

 One  good  thing  about  the  media  coverage  of  recent  weeks  is  that  it  has,  I  think,  

 increased the sensitisation of the Australian people to the difficult situation of asylum 

 seekers throughout our region and throughout the world, and perhaps helped me in 

 arguing the case that we can and should increase our humanitarian intake. 

 The second group of forgotten people in this debate are those who have lost their 

 lives on the journey to Australia. 

 The consequence of people having a greater chance of resettlement if they come to 

 Australia by boat can, unfortunately, be the kind of tragedy we saw last December 

 at  Christmas  Island,  where  a  boat  smashed  against  the  rocks  and  up  to  50  men,  

 women and children lost their lives.  Some are yet to be found. 

 This  isn’t  the  first  such  tragedy.   The  SIEV  X  sank  on  its  way  from  Indonesia  to  

 Australia  in  stormy  seas  in  October  2001.   An  estimated  353  people  drowned.  

 Inevitably, there have been other deaths that we are not aware of.  

  11

 Similar  tragedies  have  taken  place  all  over  the  world  in  similar  circumstances.   

 Around  200  people  died  attempting  to  travel  from  Libya  to  the  Italian  island  of  

 Lampedusa in April this year, followed by another up to 250 more deaths of people 

 following the same route earlier this month.  In total, more than 1,000 people have 

 died on boats between Libya and Italy in 2011 alone. 

 And yet there are people who continue to profit from others’ desperation. 

 According  to  some  estimates,  the  business  of  people  smuggling  and  human  

 trafficking  is  now  the  third  largest  criminal  activity  globally  after  the  trafficking  of  

 drugs and weapons, worth somewhere between $7-12 billion a year. 

 Now,  of  course,  while  our  plan  to  break  the  people  smugglers’  business  model  

 involves transferring people who arrive by boat to Malaysia, we recognise that it is 

 very important that appropriate care and protection be in place for those who are 

 transferred.  And those protections are being built into the operational arrangements 

 that underpin the agreement. 

 People  transferred  from  Australia  to  Malaysia  will  be  transferred  by  agreement  

 between governments. 

 So,  it  stands  to  reason,  in  line  with  the  commitment  entered  into  by  the  Prime  

 Ministers, that transferees will not be prosecuted for illegal immigration.  They will 

 not be caned.  And they will not be refouled. 

  12

 There will be a role for non-governmental organisations who wish to be involved in 

 making  this  agreement  work  through  an  advisory  body,  together  with  

 representatives of both the Malaysian and Australian Governments.  

 Of course, it is particularly important specific care and protections are in place for  

 vulnerable cases, most particularly children. 

 Blanket  exemptions  from  transfer  would  provide  a  marketing  tool  for  people  

 smugglers and not be in the best interests of any child. 

 What  is  important  is  that  we  work  with  UNH CR to make sure that no decision is 

 taken to transfer a minor until that person’s personal circumstances are taken into 

 account and that all the necessary care and protection is in place, whether that be in 

 Australia or Malaysia.  

 And that is exactly what we are doing. 

 In relation to children, this function also provides me with an opportunity to update 

 you on a project that is very important to me: the transfer of children from detention 

 facilities into the community. 

 

 Moving Children out of Detention 

 I  am  pleased  to  be  able  to  tell  you  that  the  government  is  on  track  to  meet  our  

 commitment  to  move  the  majority  of  children  from  immigration  detention  into  

 community-based accommodation by the end of June. 

  13

 Since  the  Prime  Minister  and  I  announced  the  expansion  of  community  detention  

 late last year, significant numbers of children and families have been progressively 

 moved from immigration detention facilities into community-based accommodation. 

 As of Wednesday, I have approved 1309 people for community detention since the 

 government’s announcement in October.  Of these, 678 are children. 

 Nearly  1000  people  have  already  been  moved  out  of  detention  facilities  into  

 residential arrangements, of whom 249 have since gone on to receive visas. 

 We  currently  have  over  700  people  living  in  community  detention,  including  334  

 children. 

 A further 352 people - including 195 children - will be moved into the community in 

 coming  days.   This  will  bring  the  total  number  of  people  living  in  the  community  

 under these arrangements to 1059. 

 To  date,  people  have  primarily  been  placed  in  suburbs  and  communities  in  major  

 capital cities.  

 A  comprehensive  and  care  plan  is  prepared  for  every  person  placed  in  the  

 community detention program.  This plan defines appropriate services and support 

 arrangements for each individual or family. 

 Sourcing  appropriate  housing  and  ensuring  suitable  care  and  services  exist,  

 particularly for unaccompanied minors, is an essential element of moving people out 

 of detention. 

  14

 This takes a great deal of organisation and requires a the methodical approach that 

 we have taken to making it happen. 

 There is a need to recognise the amount of work that goes into moving children out 

 of  detention  and  providing  them  with  the  support  they  require,  particularly  in  

 relation to those who have had traumatic experiences to get here. 

 The  rapid  expansion  of  the  program  to  date  has  benefited  from  the  successful  

 partnership between the Government and non-government agencies. 

 The  Australian  Red  Cross  is  the  lead  agency  for  the  implementation  of  these  

 expanded  community  detention  arrangements.   The  Red  Cross  has  drawn,  and  

 continues to draw, on the expertise of a wide range of experienced service providers 

 in the community, faith-based and welfare sectors to source accommodation, care, 

 case workers and other services. 

 A Residence Determination Reference Group also meets regularly to discuss issues 

 with the expanded community detention arrangements.  

 This includes representatives of:  

 â¢ faith-based, not-for-profit and welfare agencies; 

 â¢ Australian Red Cross; 

 â¢ Life Without Barriers; 

 â¢ members  of  my  Ministerial  Council  for  Immigration  Services  and  Status  

 Resolution (CISSR); 

 â¢ senior departmental officers; and 

  15

 â¢ a representative of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services 

 and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA). 

 I  want  to  use  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  various  agencies  and  bodies  for  their  

 engagement because it has been a very ambitious task to find the accommodation, 

 to  find  the  carers  for  unaccompanied  minors,  and  move  so  many  children  and  

 families into community-based accommodation. 

 My Department has, meanwhile, established an efficient process to identify eligible 

 individuals  or  groups  with  a  view  to  moving  them  into  community-based  

 accommodation. 

 This  will  continue  beyond  30  June  as  we  place  more  unaccompanied  minors  and  

 families into the community. 

 

 Closing 

 Let me wrap up today by thanking the organisers of this conference for inviting me 

 to be here. 

 This year marks several important anniversaries, not least the 60th anniversary of the 

 Refugees Convention. 

 Australia  has  had  a  longstanding  involvement  with  UNHCR  and  was  a  founding  

 member of the UNHCR Executive Committee in 1958 and also of its predecessor the 

 UNHCR Advisory Committee in 1951. 

  16

 In 2010, Australia provided UNHCR with over $50 million in funding. 

 We have many shared interests with UNHCR in wanting to strengthen protection and 

 we cooperate closely on: 

 â¢ resettlement needs;  

 â¢ the delivery of humanitarian assistance; and 

 â¢ the development of a stronger protection environment in the Asia-Pacific. 

 This  year’s  anniversary  provides  the  international  community  with  an  important  

 opportunity  to  reaffirm  and  strengthen  the  founding  principles  and  values  of  the  

 international protection regime. 

 We  support  the  UNHCR’s  themes  for  the  commemorations  and  my  department  is  

 currently developing specific pledges that are action-oriented and linked to the goals 

 of the commemorations. 

 We  are  also  actively  involved  in  preparations  for  the  ministerial  conference  to  be  

 held in December this year, which I hope to attend personally. 

 In  this,  the  60th  anniversary  of  the  Refugees  Convention,  Professor  Hugo’s  report  

 provides  a  clear  demonstration  of  the  significant  contribution  the  refugees  have  

 made to this country in that time. 

 With an additional 1,000 refugees arriving in  Australia annually  from July,  we look 

 forward to welcoming the next generation of refugee success stories. 

 Thank you.
