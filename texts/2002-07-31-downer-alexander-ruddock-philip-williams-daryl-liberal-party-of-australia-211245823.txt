 Government Rejects the Report of the UN Human Rights Commissioner's Envoy into Human Rights and Immigration Detention

 Joint Media Release with: Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams

 MPS 71/2002

 Mr Downer, Mr Ruddock and Mr Williams today rejected the report on 'Human Rights and Immigration Detention in Australia' by Justice Bhagwati, Personal Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

 The report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights into immigration detention in Australia is fundamentally flawed.

 It misconceives the Government's policy and ignores the fact that people in immigration detention have arrived in the country illegally. Almost all have passed through countries in which they could have sought protection en route to Australia.

 In most cases they have had the opportunity to obtain protection in a country of first asylum or a transit country.

 They have had access to due process in Australia and many have exhausted the avenues available to them and have been found not to be in need of protection. They are free to leave immigration detention and return home at any time.

 Justice Bhagwati has clearly strayed from the mandate to consider whether Australia's system of immigration detention is consistent with Australia's human rights obligations.

 His report contains a number of emotive descriptions and assertions that have no foundation in the human rights instruments to which Australia is a party.

 The report lacks objectivity and misrepresents important aspects of Australia's management of immigration detention, which takes careful account of our international human rights obligations.

 It is quite clear under international law that the process of detaining unauthorised arrivals is consistent with those human rights obligations.

 Immigration detention is an essential element underpinning the integrity of Australia's migration program and the protection of our borders.

 The policies reflect Australia's sovereign right under international law to determine who will enter our borders and be permitted to remain, and the conditions under which they may be removed.

 Without immigration detention it would not be possible to ensure that people who arrived without proper authority were available for health, security and identity checking. Also, it would not be possible to ensure the removal of people from Australia who have no lawful authority to be here.

 It is peculiar that Justice Bhagwati, despite being concerned about a lengthy appeal procedures, suggests expanding the review system to allow both administrative and judicial review. Not only could this extend the period of detention and the uncertainty faced by detainees, but it overlooks the fact that Australia complies with the UNHCR standard requiring only one avenue of review.

 Undue emphasis is also given in the report to the circumstances of particular groups of detainees such as split families and those in state prisons -the numbers of which are all very small. Moreover, Justice Bhagwati's comments on those in state prisons and those in separation detention are not based on any personal contact with such detainees.

 In addition, Justice Bhagwati describes Woomera education services as "wholly inadequate" without having actually visited the premises where schooling is conducted.

 Nothing in Justice Bhagwati's report is cause to change the view that Australia's system of immigration detention is effective and not inconsistent with our international obligations.

 As a signatory to all of the UN's core human rights instruments, Australia has a proud human rights record. Australia will continue to work constructively to strengthen the international human rights system.

 BORDER PROTECTION

 The Australian Government's Response to the Report Of The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Immigration Detention in Australia

 Talking Points

 The Government is disappointed with the UN's report into immigration detention in Australia and disagrees with it. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government welcomed the invitation of the High Commissioner to comment on the draft report. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 While the report has been amended to take account of the Government's advice on some points, it is disappointing to note that many of the Government's detailed comments on the draft report have been ignored. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The report was prepared by Justice Bhagwati. His mandate was to consider whether Australia's system of immigration detention is consistent with Australia's human rights obligations. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 He has clearly strayed from that mandate as his report contains a number of emotive descriptions and assertions that have no foundation in the human rights instruments to which Australia is a party. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The government takes its international obligations, including its human rights obligations, very seriously it does not accept that our system of immigration detention is inconsistent with our international obligations. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 nothing in Justice Bhagwati's report is cause to change that view. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Immigration detention is an essential element underpinning the integrity of Australia's migration program, and the protection of our borders. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 It is the sovereign right of Australia to determine who will enter its borders and be permitted to remain, and the conditions under which they may be removed. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Emotive descriptions of immigration detention and assertions that have no foundation in human rights instruments do not assist in debate on this difficult issue. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Without immigration detention, it would not be possible to ensure that we are able to remove people from Australia who have no lawful authority to be here. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Also, without immigration detention, it would not be possible to ensure that people who arrive without proper authority are available for health, security and identity checking. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Children

 The Bhagwati Report claims that children in detention, including unaccompanied minors, are a serious human rights concern

 in determining the most appropriate place of detention for a child, consideration is given to the best interests of the child and the importance, spelled out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) and other international instruments, of keeping âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 families together.

 In all but a limited number of cases it is likely to be in the best interests of children to remain with their parents, rather than be separated from them in alternative arrangements. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Special arrangements are in place for unaccompanied minors in detention to ensure their health and welfare are maintained. Indeed most unaccompanied minors in detention have been moved to alternate places of detention including fostering arrangements made in cooperation with state child welfare authorities.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Length of Detention

 Justice Bhagwati expresses concerns about the length of detention yet takes no account of the fact that applicants who have identity documentation, and whose claims are clear and compelling, can receive a decision on their protection application in as little as six weeks. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Where there are unresolved issues concerning proof of identity or nationality, or where there are concerns about security or health risk to the Australian community, a visa cannot be granted. Delays in character and security checks are sometimes unavoidable and not necessarily within the Australian Government's control.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The period of time in detention is lengthened by detainees appealing negative decisions through tribunals and courts. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Of course, detainees who have failed to engage Australia's protection obligations can bring their detention to an end by choosing to leave Australia and by cooperating in removal arrangements. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The government does not accept Justice Bhagwati's contention that there are numbers of persons in detention for whom there is no feasible method of removal âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Although there can be difficulties Australia is active in working with other countries to put in place arrangements to effect returns and to resolve difficult cases on a case-by-case basis. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A range of options has been developed for the return of Afghan nationals and the Government has had successes in removals of persons of other nationalities, for example, Iraqis and Iranians. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Judicial Review

 Justice Bhagwati seems not to accept that detainees who seek to challenge the legality of their detention can do so this right of review by the High Court has not been affected by the recent amendments to the jurisdiction of the Courts, including the introduction of a "privative clause" into the Migration Act. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Separated Families

 It is curious that Justice Bhagwati acknowledges that participation of women and children in the Woomera alternative housing project is completely voluntary, and yet claims that the separation from male family members causes distress to participants. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Justice Bhagwati also expresses concerns where some family members are free in the community on temporary protection visas while others remain in detention It is entirely appropriate that Australia treats refugee status determination as a procedure that applies to individuals âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 refugee law specialists acknowledge that the question of whether a person is likely to suffer persecution upon his or her eventual return to his or her country of origin has to be decided on the merits of the case âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Furthermore, of all detainees, only very small numbers fall into the 'split family' category, and then where there are very particular circumstances. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Detainee Rights

 It is not clear why Justice Bhagwati thinks detainees are inadequately informed about their rights, particularly in relation to complaints mechanisms a number of other mechanisms for making complaints to external bodies exist. In addition to the Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG), the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman regularly

 visit detention centres to investigate complaints and conduct their own inquiries. Parliamentary Committees also visit detention centres and report on conditions.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In addition, persons in immigration detention can apply for legal aid and such applications are assessed in accordance with the âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 relevant guidelines including the merits of the case

 Monitoring, Reporting and Scrutiny

 Nor is it clear why Justice Bhagwati believes there is no proper monitoring and reporting in detention centres Both HREOC and the Commonwealth Ombudsman are permanent, independent institutions which monitor and report on activities within immigration detention centres. They have statutory rights to enter detention centres to investigate complaints. They also can and do undertake their own inquiries into aspects of immigration detention.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Individual Parliamentarians and Parliamentary Committees regularly visit and report on conditions in detention centres. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the Immigration Detention Advisory Group established to provide advice on the adequacy and appropriateness of services ,accommodation and facilities has unfettered access and can make unannounced visits to detention centres âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 DIMIA also monitors closely the performance of its services provider against the Immigration Detention Standards (IDS) and contractual requirements and there are sanctions for non-performance. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 given this high level of scrutiny, the Government does not accept the need for a further body to monitor and report on detention centres. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 All of these points have been conveyed to Justice Bhagwati. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Detailed Rebuttals by Australian Government to the Report of the UN Human Rights Commissioner's Envoy into Human Rights and Immigration Detention

 Children in Detention

 Page 16 para 52 - "From a human rights point of view, the detention of children…is certainly contrary to international standards."

 The CROC and other international instruments underline the importance of keeping families together.

 In all but a limited number of cases it is likely to be in the best interests of children to remain with their parents in detention rather than be separated from them in alternative arrangements. Furthermore, UNHCR'S Executive Committee has recognised the possibility of detention as part of immigration procedures (Conclusion No. 44). In addition, the European Convention for the Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Art. 5(1) (f)) specifically recognises the possibility of detention for immigration control.

 Education of Children

 Page 16 para 52 -"…it would appear that, at least in Woomera detention centre, the education services are at best wholly inadequate."

 Because of protest action at the Woomera IRPC, which resulted in parents keeping their children away from school during his visit, Justice Bhagwati did not visit St Michael's, the premises of the former Catholic school in Woomera where the Transitional Education and Learning (TEL) Program for detainee children is conducted. It is therefore not clear how Justice Bhagwati could have formed the view through his own observation that "[Woomera] education services are at best wholly inadequate".

 The TEL program includes indoor and outdoor activities, consisting of English, maths, sport/play activities, art and craft and group socialisation skills.

 Formal classroom hours are Monday to Friday, from 9am to 12 noon. All children have access to the program. In addition, on weekday afternoons, there are a range of organised activities such as cricket, soccer, basketball (both within and outside the centre), art classes, computer access, video sessions, and field trips.

 Page 19 para 61 - "[Children] … are deprived of adequate educational facilities appropriate to their age…"

 Justice Bhagwati did not visit the Woomera educational facility, nor did he visit any other educational facility and it is therefore difficult to see how he could make such a sweeping judgement. The viewpoint takes no account of the challenge in providing education services, such as the fact that children are in detention for varying lengths of time, come from a variety of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds and have varying (and in many cases non-existent) levels of literacy in their own languages and in English.

 Accordingly, not all children can be streamed into a standard educational program for their age. Provision of English language tuition to detainee children is a priority, just as it is in the general community for non-English speaking children of newly arrived migrants and humanitarian entrants.

 Moreover, where it has been possible to make suitable arrangements with local schools, detainee children attend schools in the community where they have access to the same educational facilities as others in the Australian community.

 Unaccompanied Minors

 Page 12 para 37 - "the Minister for Immigration is the legal guardian of some… unaccompanied minors (eg the Minister is not the guardian of an unaccompanied minor with an adult relative, such as an aunt or uncle, in immigration detention)."

 Of the five unaccompanied minors held in Immigration Detention Centres (IDCs) or Immigration Reception Processing Centres (IRPCs) during Justice Bhagwati's visit, only one was a ward of the Minister under the relevant legislation. This means the others, while not accompanied by parents, are in the company of adult relatives such as an uncle or a brother.

 However, regardless of whether formally a ward of the Minister or not, particular arrangements are in place for all unaccompanied minors in detention including an assessment of their needs on arrival, development of a case management plan and monitoring and reporting requirements.

 Pages 16-17 para 53 - "(T)he Minister for Immigration is both the detainer and the guardian [of certain children], which represents a serious conflict of interest."

 There is no conflict of interest. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has delegated most of his guardianship powers and functions under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) (IGOC) Act 1946 to the DIMIA Managers and Deputy Managers in each detention facility. Neither the Minister nor his Departmental delegates under the IGOC Act make any decisions on Protection Visa applications made by unaccompanied minors (or any other Protection Visa applicants) and thus about whether or not they will continue to be detained.

 Even though the Minister and his Departmental delegates under the IGOC Act have the legal power to make decisions on Protection Visa applications, there is no obligation on the Minister or a delegate to exercise that power. There are many other persons with the appropriate delegation under the Migration Act to decide Protection Visa applications.

 The responsibility for making the decision on a Protection Visa application by an unaccompanied minor is undertaken by other Departmental officers who have that delegation under the Migration Act. This avoids any potential for, or perception of, any conflict of interest in the decision on a Protection Visa application.

 Unaccompanied minors who provide information or make claims, which prima facie may engage Australia's protection obligations receive independent advice concerning the Protection Visa process through the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS). Under this scheme migration agents are appointed to provide assistance and advice to an individual applicant in the preparation, lodgement and presentation of Protection Visa applications at primary and merits review stages.

 Length of Detention

 Page 14 para 45 - "…detention for unduly long periods is sometimes due to complications in the refugee status determination procedure itself, and sometimes due to the lengthy and cumbersome appeals procedures and unnecessary delays in disposal of the proceedings."

 Factors which influence the length of detention are the time required to make an effective assessment of a visa application, the outcome of administrative and judicial review procedures and, if necessary, time taken to make removal arrangements.

 Protection Visa applications from detainees receive the highest priority and a number of measures (such as front-end loading of security, character, and identity checks) have been implemented to expedite processing while maintaining the integrity of the assessment process.

 Applicants who have identity documentation, and whose claims are clear and compelling, can receive a decision within six weeks. Processing times for Protection Visa applications have been significantly reduced, from seven and a half months in late 1999 to less than 18 weeks by December 2001 for 80% of cases.

 Security assessments are an essential part of the Protection Visa decision-making process. The need to take greater care with issues of character checking in the wake of the events of 11 September has been recognised in Resolution 1373 of the UN Security Council. Security checks can take some time as they involve checks being made in other countries.

 The period of time in detention is lengthened by detainees appealing negative decisions through tribunals and courts and by their non-cooperation in removal.

 The Refugee Review Tribunal also accords priority to the applications of persons in detention.

 In October 2001, legislative changes were passed by the Australian Parliament which are intended to enable the courts to deal with migration matters more expeditiously. DIMIA has been working closely with the courts to enable faster consideration of detainees' cases. For example, DIMIA provides all relevant documents directly to the Court, which avoids the need for detainees to do so.

 This has considerably assisted the courts' handling of detainees' cases by reducing delays experienced due to the failure of applicants filing relevant material in accordance with court orders. Most court registries have introduced streamlined procedures in migration matters which have also sped up the consideration of detainees' cases. In 1995-96 it took the Federal Court more than 10 months, on average, to resolve an application for review of a portfolio decision. In 2000-01, it took about 5.5 months on average.

 It is worth noting that some 3900 asylum seekers in total are currently awaiting a decision from the Department on their refugee status. Of this number, only 37 people are awaiting a primary decision in detention. This figure includes all unauthorised boat and air arrivals who have sought asylum and a number of others whose visas have expired or been cancelled and have therefore been detained.

 Page 14 para 46 - "Some persons who have been assessed by the Refugee Review Tribunal to meet the criteria set out in Article 1A of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees remain in detention for several months as DIMIA completes consideration of the refugee status of the individual, taking into account security and other character matters….inquiries regarding security and other character matters could have been made before the assessment by the Refugee Review Tribunal."

 Character and security checks are initiated by DIMIA at the commencement of processing of an unauthorised arrival. This is often before an application for protection is even made. While efforts are made to expedite this checking process, given the country of origin and transit routes to Australia of many asylum seekers, these checks can take considerable time to complete.

 Page 18 para 61 - "The unduly long period of detention … with no assurance as to when it will come to an end and they will attain freedom is a matter of serious concern."

 The length of the period of detention should not be considered in the abstract but must be considered alongside the reasons for detention (that is to ensure that unlawful non-citizens are available for processing, to allow identity, security and health checks to be made and to ensure availability for removal if they are not owed protection).

 The period of time spent in detention can be lengthened by detainees appealing negative decisions through tribunals and courts and by their non-cooperation in removal arrangements. Detainees who have failed to engage Australia's protection obligations can bring their detention to an end by choosing to leave Australia and by cooperating in removal arrangements.

 Judicial Review

 Page 15 para 48 - "While … challenge before the court is in theory possible - persons in immigration detention do have the ability to challenge the lawfulness of their detention under domestic law - the simple fact that the Act stipulates that all unlawful non-citizens must be detained, restricts the courts from reviewing the decision to detain. Moreover the power of judicial review has subsequently been considerably limited by amendments made to the Act."

 Persons in immigration detention do have the ability to challenge the lawfulness of their detention under domestic law. Immigration detainees have the capacity to take proceedings before the High Court to determine the legality of their detention. A writ of habeas corpus is available to challenge the lawfulness of the detention and allows the High Court to examine whether the detention is in accordance with the domestic Australian law.

 If the detention is not in accordance with Australian law, the High Court can order the release of the person despite the provisions of subsection 196(3) of the Migration Act (which prevents release even by a court of an immigration detainee without a visa).

 This right of review by the High Court has not been affected by the recent amendments to the jurisdiction of the courts, including the introduction of a "privative clause" in section 474 of the Migration Act.

 Separated Families

 Page 15 para 49 - "Families in detention are sometimes separated (eg in the Woomera family housing project, where wife and children are living in Woomera town while the husband is detained in the centre)....which….appears to introduce another element of distress…. it appears questionable whether the separation of families is advisable, even if the participation in the family housing project is completely voluntary."

 There appears to be a contradiction in Justice Bhagwati's views in relation to the women and children alternative housing project in Woomera. While Justice Bhagwati acknowledges that participation of women and children in the project is completely voluntary, he also claims that the separation from male family members causes distress to participants.

 Pages 15-16 para 50 - "Temporary Protection Visa [holders] do not have the right to family reunification. …in a few cases, in situations where the members of the family are present in Australia at the same time... some are in detention and others are not."

 Temporary Protection Visas are by their very nature a temporary measure. Unless and until a person establishes their right to remain in Australia permanently, the Government does not consider it appropriate to provide family reunification processes.

 In addition, the fact that one member of a family is a refugee does not automatically mean that another member of the family will be a refugee. As noted by Grahl-Madsen:

 "Extreme situations apart, the question whether a person is likely to suffer persecution upon his eventual return to his country of origin has to be decided upon the merits of each individual case." (Atle Grahl-Madsen The Status of Refugees in International Law , Volume 1, 1966, page 181)

 It is entirely appropriate that Australia treats refugee status determination as a procedure that applies to individuals.

 Furthermore, in only three cases do detainees have a spouse in the community who is either an Australian citizen or who has been granted a Temporary Protection Visa, including one case where the couple married while both were in detention.

 Detainee Rights

 Page 17 paras 54 and 55 - "…it was felt that accessing legal aid with regard to complaints about treatment and conditions in the detention centres presented a genuine difficulty. … a properly structured scheme … .would ensure access to legal aid services and appropriately provide persons in detention with information about their rights."

 Persons in immigration detention can apply for legal aid and such applications are assessed in accordance with the relevant guidelines, including the merits of the case.

 A number of other mechanisms for making complaints to external bodies already exist. In addition to the (acknowledged) role of IDAG, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman regularly visit detention centres to investigate complaints and conduct their own inquiries. Parliamentary committees visit detention centres and report on conditions.

 The Australian Government has consistently taken the position that a detainee will be allowed reasonable access to legal advice if such advice is requested by a detainee. In addition, where a person raises claims which prima facie may engage Australia's protection obligations, they are provided with professional assistance to help prepare their protection visa application and expedite processing at both primary and merits review stages.

 This is done through the Government-funded Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS). Detainees are expected to be kept informed about application progress by their IAAAS provider. Of course, detainees can and do seek information, advice and assistance from other parties. However, this can be problematic if such parties provide information to detainees that confuses rather than clarifies, or generates expectations of release that cannot be met.

 The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs also has a role in providing detainees with appropriate and timely advice and information about their visa applications. The Department recognises the importance of detainees being able to communicate regularly with its staff about any concerns they might have about processing times. With increased staffing levels in detention centres over the last year, a proactive program of regular, scheduled meetings with individual detainees has been developed to discuss any issues including the status of their applications.

 Page 17-18 para 57 - "….the need for a permanent, institutionalized and independent body to conduct monitoring and reporting activities on a continuing basis would appear to be evident."

 The extent of public scrutiny of immigration detention is discussed above. Both HREOC and the Commonwealth Ombudsman are permanent, independent institutions which monitor and report on activities within immigration detention centres. They have statutory rights to enter detention centres to investigate complaints. They also can and do undertake their own inquiries into aspects of immigration detention.

 DIMIA also monitors closely the performance of its Services Provider against the IDS and contractual requirements and there are sanctions for non-performance. DIMIA's duty of care in the detention environment is underpinned by the availability of timely, comprehensive and accurate information from its Services Provider about day-to-day activities.

 This is required to enable DIMIA to answer, often at very short notice, requests for information from Parliament, and from authorities with a statutory power to investigate matters within Commonwealth jurisdiction, such as the Commonwealth Ombudsman or HREOC.

 The Services Provider is expected to provide information on a daily basis about incidents and complaints that occur within facilities. DIMIA analyses this information along with other types of information obtained from various sources to determine whether there are any systemic issues that may require remedial action across facilities or across elements of service provision.

 Separation Detention

 Page 17 para 56 - "…persons [in separation detention] might be seriously handicapped on account of ignorance about their rights and might, at the same time, quite possibly fall within the category of people who are most in need of information about their rights."

 We question the inclusion in Justice Bhagwati's report of matters to do with separation detention. At the time of his visit, there were no immigration detainees in separation detention either in Woomera IRPC or in any other mainland Australian detention facility.

 Separation detention is an area or areas in a detention facility in which new arrivals are kept separate from other detainees. Separation detention is a management tool through which the integrity of Australia's visa determination process is maintained. Effective separation detention provides the Government with the assurance that any claims by unlawful non-citizens to remain in Australia are put forward by detainees without the embellishment and coaching of others.
