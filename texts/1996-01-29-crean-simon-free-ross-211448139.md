  JOINT STATEMENT

  A GREATER VOICE AND SERVICE FOR YOUNG AUSTRALIANS 

  The national youth communications network announced in Young Australia will  provide young people with a linked series of avenues to provide direct input and  receive advice on Government policies and services that affect them, the Minister for  Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, and the Minister for Schools,  Vocational Education and Training Minister, Ross Free, said today. 

  Mr Crean said the need for better communications between young people and  government was highlighted in consultations with young people. 

  "In recognition of this, a Y oun~ Australia Group will be established to enable young  people from a wide spectrum of society to represent young peoples' views and provide  advice and ideas directly to Government." 

  "In consultation with community and youth advisory groups, membership will be  drawn from under 25 year olds in fields such as business, the arts, media,  entertainment, welfare and education and be supported through the Commonwealth's  Youth Bureau," he said. 

  "The clear message we received was that young people want to be consulted. They  want to be listened to. They don't want solutions imposed on them. They want better  access to education and training and better channels of information to find out what  their options are," he said. 

  "And they particularly want input into making sure that government information and  programs 'bear their stamp," he said. 

  Mr Free said, that in tandem with establishment of the Young Australia Group, the re " instatement of the inter-departmental committee Youth Network will facilitate  improved coordination of Government youth policies and programs. "One of the first  tasks of the Network will be to develop a youth information strategy covering the full  range of Commonwealth activities." 

  An Australian Youth Network site will also be established on Internet and linked to the  expanded Triple J Web site, JNET, to provide young people with access to information  on all aspects of Government youth services and programs. 

  "This S3 million initiative builds on the success of the interactive Johnnie Crow Files  (http:/www.deet.gov.au/crow) established on Internet as part of the Working Nation 

  1358 

  Youth CamDaign and will provide an ideal vehicle for opening up the lines of two-way  communicauon," Mr Crean said. 

  Mr Free said at the regional level, the 62 Area Consultative Committees set up under  Working Nation have agreed to have youth representation on the Committees and to  arrange regular Youth Forums to ensure local young people have input to regional  solutions for tackling youth unemployment 

  The first round of forums will occur across Australia during February and March 1996. 

  Mr Free said the national youth communications. network will be coordinated through  the Commonwealth's Youth Bureau in the Department of Employment Education and  Training. "Additional resources have been allocated to the Youth Bureau in  recognition of the need to strengthen its capacity to carry out these functions." 

  Better Servicing 

  Mr Crean said Young Australia also enhances and expands the youth service network  options available to young people through initiatives such as: 

   " funding of up to 132 specialist youth contracted case managers through ESRA  which will service close to 12,000 young people;   " substantially expanding case managements services for disadvantaged youth  through the new $11 million Homeless Youth and Refugee Action Program 

  (HYRAP);   " funding case management services for secondary school students on the  AUSTIJDY and ABSTIJDY Student Homeless Rate;   " extending the initial twelve month funding of 52 Youth Liaison Offers to the turn of 

  the century;   " funding for an A YP AC network liaison officer;   " development of the Youth Network site on Internet; and   " publication of the Youth Info Book. 

  "Youth Access Centres will continue to provide a central point in the community  where young people can access personalised service and general information in an  environment that they are comfortable in," he said. 

  Mr Crean said that, in developing and refining Government programs for youth and  communicating information, we need to reflect their culture and values and recognise  that young people want the power to achieve worthwhile goals for themselves as  independent Australians. 

  "The Federal Government is conunitted to facilitating this and will continue to listen  and respond to the needs of all young Australians."
