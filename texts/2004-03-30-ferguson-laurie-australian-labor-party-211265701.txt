 LAURIE FERGUSON MP   

 Shadow Minister for Population, Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 30 March 2004  

 CITIZENSHIP CEREMONIES FURTHER POLITICISED 

 

 Minister Hardgrave has today written to all Federal MPs inviting them to apply  for a standing delegation to preside at citizenship ceremonies.   

 His action confirms a long-held suspicion that the Howard Government is  progressively moving away from the traditional Australian practice of holding  non-partisan citizenship ceremonies under the auspices of local Councils.   

 The Howard Governmentâ€™s own Australian Citizenship Council, chaired by Sir  Ninian Stephen, recommended that the conduct of public ceremonies by local  Councils be the principal means of conferral of Australian citizenship. The then  Minister for Immigration, Mr Ruddock, gladly accepted this recommendation.   

 Bit by bit Minister Hardgrave seems determined to hand citizenship ceremonies  over to politicians and community groups of his choosing. This is a bad signal to  refugees and migrants from totalitarian countries where public civic events are  often party political in nature.    

 Citizenship ceremonies belong to the migrants concerned, who have elected to  fully access the rights and responsibilities involved in being Australian. They  should not be used as a cheap political football.
