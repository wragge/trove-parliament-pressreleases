 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW , PARLIAMENT HOUSE,   22 JUNE 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:    Senate petrol price inquiry; Migration Bill;  Shooting by  Australian forces in Baghdad   

 BEAZLEY: I call on Liberal and National Senators to join Barnaby Joyce and  support our proposition for a proper Senate Inquiry into the way petrol pricing is  done in this country.  We want those petrol company executives before a Senate  Committee explaining themselves to the Australian people.     

 We will release the Terms of Reference today but I sincerely hope that a leaf is  taken out of Barnaby Joyce’s book by other Liberal and National Party Senators  and they join us, in the public interest, so the public can see why it is they’re  paying the petrol prices they’re now paying.     

 There’s another issue around and that is the division in the Liberal Party room  about John Howard’s new Immigration Bill.  John Howard should go to Indonesia  and tell the Indonesian President that he is withdrawing the Immigration Bill -  withdrawing it in the national interest.  He should have the courage to explain to  the Indonesian President that our laws are our business and our laws in this area  are good.     

 It is ludicrous to be contemplating now building houses all over the Pacific to  house refugees.  That is absurd.  But that apparently is what the Government is  now thinking about.  That’s not in the Australian national interest.  Defending our  borders properly, defending our laws properly, that’s in the Australian national  interest.  And John Howard should have the courage to explain to President  Yudhoyono that our legislation is right, that it is not aimed against Indonesia and  we should stop sending these signals that we can be pressured.   

 

 JOURNALIST: On petrol Mr Beazley, do you have any doubts that the petrol  companies are price gouging because when you see fuel prices going up the day  before a long weekend?   

 BEAZLEY:  Look you see ridiculous things.  Same weekend one set of  fuel prices in the east where there’s holidays - another set of fuel prices in the  west where there are none.  One set of fuel prices at the weekend - another set  of fuel prices in the middle of the week when quite clearly something is going on 

 here that requires an explanation.  Obviously the ACCC ought to have a mandate  from the Government to permanently monitor and place pressure on the  companies.  But the Government won’t do that.  Therefore, we go for the Senate  Inquiry option.  And we see from yesterday’s news that Barnaby Joyce is  prepared to be supportive and that there are some Liberals privately supportive -  good.  Get on board with this and at least we’ll have some exposure from the  petrol company executives as to how all this is happening.   

 JOURNALIST: Is this a test for the Prime Minister too because if follows on  from what they want to try and do to some of Senate Committees?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well, they’ve gutted the Senate Committees but John  Howard says that nothings changed despite the fact that they’re gutted.  Well  let’s see if there’s any proof to that.  Let’s see if there’s any veracity to that  particular claim.  Let the Senate do a proper inquiry here. 

 

 JOURNALIST: You’ve had some internal division in the past do you feel for  Mr Howard at the moment?   

 BEAZLEY:  Look, John Howard is acting against the Australian national  interest - he’s got this wrong.  An appeasement was wrong.  What was right was  an explanation that nothing in our laws was aimed against Indonesia.  You’ve got  to stand up and fight for your national interests.  You can’t just keep rolling over  and hoping spin gets you through - it just won’t do.  That’s what he’s trying to do  now and basically some of his back benchers won’t put up with it.   

 JOURNALIST:  Wouldn’t  it  inflame  the situation though if he goes to  President Yudhoyono and said: “look we’re going to pull the pin now”.  Isn’t that  going to be detrimental to our relations? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  If it is a problem, it’s a problem of John Howard’s making,  and you’ve got to clean up your own mess in this life.  He’s not acted well in this.   He’s been out of touch - he’s not concentrating on the Australian people.  He’s  thought about himself and he’s thought about opportunities how to go at us, and  in the end he’s had a go at the country.  Now, basically what John Howard now  needs to do, even though it’s harder that it should have been because of his own  mistakes, he’s nevertheless got to correct his mistakes. 

 

 JOURNALIST: On petrol, Graeme Samuel from the ACCC says there is an  explanation for the variable petrol prices, it’s supply and demand.     

 BEAZLEY:  Well Graeme Samuel ought to be actually be given a  reference to properly monitor - they haven’t actually inspected the way in which  petrol pricing is done, I think for the best part of a decade when the price of petrol  was half what it is now when they last had a look.  And what the Government  ought to doing is saying to Graeme Samuel: “you’ve got a reference here sport, 

 you ought to get on the job, monitor these people put pressure on them”.  Well  they’re not going to say that, you know we’ve repeatedly asked them to do that.   So, okay there’s another course you can pursue and that’s the course that we’ve  suggested.  Go down the road of a Senate Inquiry and let the Senate place  pressure on the company executives to ‘fess up to how things are done on petrol  pricing.  And as I said, I’m pleased to see that Barnaby Joyce shares that view - I  hope other Liberals do too and I’d urge them.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, Defence has just confirmed that soldiers were  involved in this shooting (inaudible) Trade Minister’s security detail.   

 BEAZLEY:  Are you sure they were soldiers?  I thought they were  security guards.   

 JOURNALIST: They’re seeking to say some sort of Defence people - how  damaging is that incident to our relations?   

 BEAZLEY:  Can I say that is a tragic situation I’m afraid in a difficult,  complex, civil conflict like that, the possibility of what they describe as blue on  blue, friendly fire, death is always a possibility and it has the most terrible effects  both on the people who, of course, and their families, who are killed or injured,  and on the people who inadvertently have triggered the situation.  And so, there’s  sadness and grief to go around.  The point is this: we shouldn’t be there.  We  made a mistake going to Iraq in the first place.  We should not be there now.   What John Howard should be doing right now is using the fact the Japanese are  withdrawing, to withdraw that part of our forces as well - we should be out.   Those forces in al-Muthanna providence should now be coming out.     

 Now, the problem that we’ve got here is John Howard, I think has an eye on not  so much the national interest or even the real situation on the ground in Iraq, he  has an eye to his relationship with the President of the United States.  And that’s  always important but not a good enough rationale in this case.  The British are  coming out; the Italians are gone; the Dutch are gone.  Over the next six months 

 you’re going to see the Americans start substantially reducing their forces.  We  have a perfect break, if you like, a perfect moment right now to withdraw those  Australian forces.  And John Howard should not miss that opportunity.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, just on the migration laws, with a group of  moderates, there are obviously still sticking points, yet Labor says whatever  concessions are agreed to it’s still not good enough (inaudible) is that right? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  Because we stand for the national interest.  The national  interest is not served by appeasement in this instance.  We have tough border  laws.  We supported the creation of those border laws.  The border laws should  not now be changed at the behest of another country - it sets precedents - the  precedents are all bad.  The precedents are all along the lines: you put a bit of 

 pressure on Australia and you can get anything out of them.  This is not how you  defend the national interest.  Whatever the arguments are that are behind those  dissidents in the Liberal Party, they’re at least performing this major national  service in forcing John Howard to rethink his position.  He should rethink it all the  way.  He should withdraw the Bill and explain to President Yudhoyono that  there’s nothing in our legislation that’s aimed at Indonesia - quite the contrary.
