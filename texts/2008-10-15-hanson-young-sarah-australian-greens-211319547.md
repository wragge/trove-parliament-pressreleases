 Senate blocks inquiry into asylum seeker  tragedy   

 

 A motion calling for a judicial inquiry into the Commonwealth Government’s People  Smuggling Strike Team’s actions, including those concerning the boat known as SIEV X  and its tragic loss of life, has been voted down by the Senate.   

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young moved the motion, which also called for  recognition of the seventh anniversary on October 19 of the SIEV X’s sinking, from  which 353 lives were lost. The Greens and other cross-bench senators supported it; the  Government and Opposition voted against.   

 Senator Hanson-Young said it was disappointing that the Government in particular had  not supported a judicial inquiry.   

 “While in Opposition, Labor was outspoken on the Howard Government’s people  smuggling disruption policies and handling of the SIEV X tragedy,” she said.   

 “In September 2002, Senator John Faulkner declared he would continue to press for a  judicial inquiry into what he described as ‘very serious matters’.   

 “What on earth could have changed over the past six years such that the loss of 353  lives, including 146 children, is no longer a serious enough matter to deserve a judicial  inquiry?”   

 Senator Hanson-Young said the Greens would continue to push for a judicial inquiry into  the matter.   

 “Australia has much to do to restore its international obligations to asylum seekers,” she  said.   

 “A judicial inquiry would allow the truth to be uncovered around this appalling blight on  Australia’s history books, and act as a measure to ensure that such horror will never  happen again.”    

 The text of Senator Hanson-Young’s motion follows.  For more information: Gemma Clark on 0427 604 760
