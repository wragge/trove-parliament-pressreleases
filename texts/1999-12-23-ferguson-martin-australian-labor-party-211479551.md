  OPPOSITION WELCOMES REPORT ON

  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

  

  The Federal Opposition toda y endorsed a report by a committee 
of experts looking into the growing problem of illegal immigration to 
Australia.

  

 Acting Shadow Immigration Minister, Martin Ferguson, 
said the recommendations by the External Reference Group (ERG) report 
on illegal immigration were an important first step in the fight to 
curb people-smuggling to Australia.

  

 “The External Reference Group has identified that 
people-smuggling is an international, multi-million dollar industry 
that is preying on vulnerable people,” Mr Ferguson said.

  

 “Labor endorses the report’s conclusion that we 
need to send a stronger message to people-smugglers that Australia is 
not a soft target for their operations.

  

 “Illegal immigrants who are able to afford to pay 
their way should not be given preferential treatment over genuine asylum 
seekers. We must defend the integrity of our immigration program.”

  

 Mr Ferguson also welcomed a new push by Immigration 
Minister Phillip Ruddock to curtail illegal immigration through an overseas 
information campaign targeted at source countries such as Iran, Jordan, 
Pakistan and Turkey.

  

 However, Mr Ferguson said that the Government’s 
priority should be to secure international cooperation with source countries, 
rather than spending money on glossy brochures, posters and postcards.

  

 “At the end of the day, a publicity campaign is 
not going to stop anyone who desperately wants to come this country,” 
Mr Ferguson said.
