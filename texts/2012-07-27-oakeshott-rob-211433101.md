 MEDIA RELEASE 

 27 July 2012 

 DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME MUST HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 

 THE failure of the Commonwealth and NSW Government to resolve a funding stoush over  one of the most important health reforms this nation will ever undertake is disappointing but  not unexpected, Independent Lyne MP Rob Oakeshott said today. 

 “We have the capacity as a nation to fund this scheme and give every Australian peace of  mind that if they or a loved one acquires a lifelong disability, they will be taken care of,” Mr  Oakeshott said. 

 “What we don’t have in this country at the moment are parliamentarians willing to take the  politics out of issues that should be resolved in the national interest, be it disabilities, school  education funding or even asylum-seekers. 

 “The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a national reform that will benefit 400,000  Australians. But it can’t be delivered without the states, and New South Wales, the country’s  largest economy, has a moral obligation to participate.  

 “Seventy million dollars over three years isn’t a big ask of NSW, particularly when it will  make the world of difference to those whose lives have been turned upside because of an  accident or ill health. 

 “This is important policy reform, not only for the nation, not only for New South Wales but in  particular for the Mid-North Coast. 

 “At six to eight per cent, we are in the nation’s highest percentile range for the number of  people who require assistance due to a disability. 

 “This scheme has the potential to give these families and elderly carers hope, but only if the  state and federal governments can put politics aside and do what’s right.”
