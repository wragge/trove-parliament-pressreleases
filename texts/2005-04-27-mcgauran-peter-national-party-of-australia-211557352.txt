 Australia Welcomes Long-Suffering Refugees

 27 April 2005 

 91 Liberian refugees arrived to a new life in Melbourne today after having spent years in refugee camps in Africa.

 Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs Peter McGauran welcomed the new-arrivals to  Australia, saying their arrival was evidence of Australia’s world-class Humanitarian Program and settlement services. 

 ‘Many of the refugees have endured horrifying experiences such as witnessing executions of family members, rape,  torture, destruction of homes and forced labour during the civil war in Liberia in the 1990s,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘Having fled to the Ivory Coast, rebel attacks forced them to flee again to the relative safety of the UNHCR camps of Kola  and Laine in Guinea where they have been ever since.

 ‘Given the trauma experienced by this group, the process of settling in a new country with a vastly different way of life is  understandably daunting. Australians can be proud of our Humanitarian Program which offers a new life to 13,000 people  in the most desperate need of resettlement every year.

 The 91 arrivals in Melbourne were part of a group of almost 400 Liberian refugees, including 202 children and 177 adults,  comprising 41 families. Groups of new arrivals will be settled in Melbourne (80), Geelong (11), Sydney (85), Perth (75),  Adelaide (62), Brisbane (49), and Newcastle (17). 

 ‘Our assistance to these refugees continues long after they arrive through the Australian Government’s Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS),’ Minister McGauran said.

 IHSS assistance includes intensive reception and case management services including accommodation support, help in  establishing a household and health and psychological services, and links to essential services such as Centrelink,  Medicare and banking.

 Before leaving Guinea, the Liberian refugees were shown a new settlement video to help them to prepare to build a new  life in Australia. The video, A New Country - A New Life, was officially launched by Minister McGauran today and  forms part of the Government’s Australian Cultural Orientation (AUSCO) three-day course for incoming refugee and  humanitarian entrants.

 ‘This video is a vital part of the settlement process to help new arrivals to better understand life in Australia so they can  develop a sense of belonging within their new communities as soon as possible.’

 ‘The video has been translated into Arabic, Dari and French and so far more than 250 AUSCO courses have been held in  Guinea, Kenya, Egypt, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran and Thailand, helping  more than 5,300 new arrivals.
