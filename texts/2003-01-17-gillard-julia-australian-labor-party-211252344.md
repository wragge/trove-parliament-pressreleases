 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration   

 RUDDOCK BREAKS HIS PROMISE TO LIBERAL MODERATES   

 In a radio interview today, Minister Ruddock appeared to confirm that the soft rhetoric of his  ministerial statement to Parliament last month was designed solely to appease Liberal  moderates threatening to cross the floor and vote for Labor’s amendment to the Migration  Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill.   

 In his 3 December 2002 ministerial statement, he announced that his Department would now  be bound by guidelines relating to the fostering of unaccompanied children and placing  women and children in accommodation like the Woomera alternate detention trial.  Minister  Ruddock was forced to make these changes even though he has always maintained any  softening of detention arrangements would be a magnet for people smugglers. 

 

 Today he responded to a motion passed at the Australian Education Union national  conference calling for all children in detention to be able to attend normal schools by saying  he would adopt a case-by-case approach to the issue and look at each child’s individual needs.   

 The Minister’s radio comments confirm his ministerial statement was only made as a sop to  the Liberal moderates a week before debate on the Bill in the House of Representatives.    Labor’s amendment sought to modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that the  Government would be compelled to:  

 

 â¢ Put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements.  â¢ Allow families with children to live in accommodation like the Woomera alternate  detention trial.     

 Labor’s amendment was part of its continuing campaign to get children out from behind the  razor wire.  This campaign commenced on Australia Day 2002, when Opposition Leader  Simon Crean called for the Government to get the children out of detention. 

 

 Liberal moderates should ask themselves exactly what their campaign has achieved.
