 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats     July 8,  2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                                 03/492                     

 

 Government’s Priorities More Twisted than Barbed Wire    

 Five children at the centre of a court case on immigration detention must be released along with all  other children trapped behind Australia’s detention centre razor wire, Australian Democrats’ Leader  Senator Andrew Bartlett said today.   

 Senator Bartlett said today’s Family Court ruling dismissing Immigration Minister Philip  Ruddock’s application to keep the children imprisoned while the Government appealed the original  ruling that it was illegal to keep children detained indefinitely, was a major victory for common  sense and compassion.   

 “We have constantly said immigration centres are no place for children,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “This is a significant decision in the process of unpicking of the most heartless elements of this  Government’s cruel policy on refugees.   

 “Imprisoning innocent children is entirely unjustifiable.  The Government must accept the rule of  law and the decision of the Court.   

 “No government has the right to use innocent children as political pawns.  It is time this  Government developed a scintilla of compassion.”   

 Senator Bartlett said it was a stunning admission by the Prime Minister that he was prepared to  spend any amount of money to ensure no asylum seeker set foot on the Australian mainland.   

 The Government’s ruthlessness is all about justifying their massively costly bungle of sending  Vietnamese asylum seekers to Christmas Island after they were intercepted so close to Port  Hedland.   

 “The Howard Government has this extraordinary obsession with spending any amount of money -  taxpayers money - to make a point to asylum seekers.   

 “This is at a time when our hospitals, schools and universities are crying out for funding.  This  Government’s priorities are truly twisted.”
