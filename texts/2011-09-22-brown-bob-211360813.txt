 Australia should disengage from Afghanistan war 

 Greens Leader Bob Brown today urged Prime Minister Julia Gillard to make good on  her promise to have an annual debate on Australia’s military commitment to the war  in Afghanistan and, amid an increasingly ugly debate on asylum seekers, urged all  sides to respect the right of people fleeing that war to seek asylum in this country. 

 “Australian soldiers should be brought home, without delay. As Professor Hugh  White said this morning, the government should consider that we might lose as  many as another 40 Australians there over the next three years, Senator Brown said. 

 “Keeping Australian troops there for an extra three years - the Government’s self-imposed timeframe - will make very little difference to how the Afghan people settle  their own affairs.” 

 “Driven out by persecution and violence, some 75% of asylum seekers arriving by  boat between September 2008 and September 2010 were born in Afghanistan. How  can it be moral for Australia, a nation engaged in the war in Afghanistan for more  than a decade, to refuse to accept people fleeing that country.”
