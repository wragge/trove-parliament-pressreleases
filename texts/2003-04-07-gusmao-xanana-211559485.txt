 On the occasion of the Chancellor’s Human Rights Lecture

 “Challenges for Peace and Stability”

 Madam  Chancellor,

 Mr  Vice-Chancellor,

 Distinguished  faculty  and  students,

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen,

 It is an honour  and  a  pleasure  to  be  here  tonight  at  one  of  Australia’s  oldest  and foremost institutions  of  higher  education,  a  University  that  has  and  continues  to recognize its  major  responsibility towards supporting  human  rights  and  providing intellectual  leadership  in  this  field  both  in  the  national  and  international  contexts.

 I have  been  asked tonight  to  speak  on  the Challenges for Peace  and  Stability, focussing  on  the national reconciliation  process  in  Timor-Leste  and its importance in  developing  positive  regional  relations.

 For many  years  Timor-Leste suffered tremendous human rights violations  and  led an  isolated  existence  at  the  periphery  of  the  world.  These two facts  are  interlinked. In  the  thoughts  I  would  like  to  share  with  you  this  evening,  I  will focus  on  what  the people  and  institutions  of  our  newly  independent Timor-Leste are doing  to  build  a future  based  on  respect  for  human  rights  as  a  responsible and  equal  citizen  of  the world.

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen,  I  know  that  your  university  has  a  strong  commitment  to contributing  to  the  work  of  promoting  peace,  reconciliation  and  conflict resolution. Events  in  the  world  today  remind  us  every  moment  of  the importance  of  this  work. Perhaps the experiences  of  our small  nation  might  offer  some  insights  into this work.

 2

 I would like  to  begin  by  focusing  on  a  word much  used,  in  many  cultural  and political contexts,  though  not  always  with the  depth  of  understanding  it  deserves: Reconciliation!

 Reconciliation  is  at  once  a  simple  and  a  complex concept. Say  it  quickly,  as  many people do,  and  we  think  we  know  what  it  means  -long-time  enemies  coming together,  making  peace.  Simple  but  intricate  in  the  complexity  of  all  the  personal, psychological, cultural,  political  and  social  dimensions that  this  can  mean even  for any  two  individuals.  Reconciliation  is  a  simultaneous  reaching  into  ourselves  to  find the  strength  and  courage  to  make  peace,  and  a  reaching  out  to  the  other  with whom  we  have  been  in  conflict.  We  can  see that  this  is  never  easy,  it  cannot  b e completed  in  one  simple  action  but  is  a  long,  ongoing  process.

 Since 2000,  the  Timorese  began  to  explore  the possibility  of  establishing  a  Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which  was  eventually established  on  21  January 2002.   This  Commission  is  known  by  its  Portuguese acronym,  CAVR.  The

 Chairperson  is  Timor-Leste’s  pre-eminent  human  rights lawyer,  Mr.  Aniceto Guterres  Lopes.

 The  CAVR  has  over  200  staff  and  commissioners, and  has  teams  working  in  every district  of  Timor-Leste.  It  is  a  strong  community  focus,  and  is  working  in  villages  all over  Timor-Leste.  It  has  a  mandate: - To  seek  the  truth  about  human  rights  violations  that  occurred  in  Timor-Leste

 between  25  April  1974  and  25  October  1999,  meaning  the  violations  occurred even  before  the  Indonesian  invasion. - To  assist  the  reintegration into  their  communities  of  people  who have harmed  them  by  committing  less  serious  crimes.

 Tetum speakers have  a  word  for  reconciliation:  “Nahe Biti” - literally meaning “stretching  the  mat”  -  this  stretching  of  the  traditional  grass  mat  and  opening  it out makes space for others  to  sit  on  the  mat  and  so  tell  their  sides  of  the story

 too.

 A special  feature  of  the  CAVR  is  its grassroots focus  on  reconciliation,  in  what  it calls  community  reconciliation  procedures.  This  is  rooted  in  the  culture  of  the  “nahe biti”. These are hearings held  at  the  village  level,  where perpetrators  of  less

 serious  crimes  come  forward  voluntarily  to  admit  what they have  done  and  seek  to reconcile  with  victims  and  the  whole  community.

 These  hearings  link  the  formal  justice system with the customs  of  each  local area. They  are  legitimate both  in  the  eyes  of  jurists and rural communities who respect both  the  modern  law  and  the  ancient  traditions  of  our  land.  The  CAVR  aims  to  hold hearings for  over  1000  perpetrators,  and  already  has  processed  approximately 250.

 In  the  other  part  of  the  Commission’s  mandate,  seeking  the  truth  about  all human rights violations, including the  most  serious  violations,  the  CAVR  is  taking statements from  victims  all  over  the  country.  So  far,  over  2500  people have recorded their statements. The Commission also  holds  public  hearings, where  it focuses  on  recognizing  the  pain  of  victims,  making peace and trying  to  deal with our  past  and  healing the divisions  and  ruptures  in  our  society  -  and  through  their individual  stories  showing  us  the  national  story.

 Reconciliation  means  peace  of  mind within ourselves;  freedom  from feelings  o f bitterness,  division,  suspicion,  misunderstanding.   To  heal  also  the  divides  and ruptures  that  sometimes  happened  even within  a  family, within villages, between former  friends.

 3

 What  then  should  we  do  to  achieve  this healing  process,  in  the building  of  our country,  in  the  building  of  a  new  society?

 We  advocate  a  reconciliation  process  whereby  there  is  justice  but  which eschews revenge,  resentment  or  hatred.   Reconciliation  in  Timor-Leste  is  a  complex  process requiring  the  careful  balancing  of  interests.  On  the  one  hand,  the  interests  o f justice  and  the  suffering  of  the  victim,  on  the  other  hand  the  need  to  heal  a  land.

 The  CAVR  is  the  first reconciliation Commission established  in  the  Asian  region. We know  that  human rights  activists  and  governments  in  the  region  are  watching this  innovative  process  with  interest.  In  this  way,  the  small  nation  of  Timor-Leste  is leading  in  the promotion  of  human  rights,  and  making  a  real contribution  to  the issue  of  how  to  build  peace  after  years  of  conflict.

 Reconciliation  is  a  pre-requisite  for  national  stability,  and  national  stability  is  a  pre-requisite  for  development.

 Reconciliation unveils  itself  to  people  as  a  political  and  moral  exercise  demanded only  to  perpetrators  and  victims  of  violence.

 It  is  very  important for  the  future  peace  and  stability  in  the  country,  to  address other,  no  less  relevant,  aspects.

 I  understand  the  international  community  was  concerned  with the November events in  Baucau,  with  the  4th December  events  in  Dili,  with  events  in  Atsabe  on  4th January and with the destabilizing actions  in  the  western  region,  close  to  the  border.  Last Friday,  4th  April,  the  Security  Council  decided  to  postpone the  PKF  withdrawal timeframe,  because  of  threats  and  security  issues  in  the  territory.  

 There  are  two  causes  for  the  current  instability  in  Timor-Leste.

 One  is  the  degree  of  frustration  demonstrated  via  protests  or  violent  actions  by  the youth  together  with  former  Falintil  combatants.  The  second  one  is  more  like  a  need to put  political  pressure  on  the reconciliation  process  itself.  Despite the effort undertaken  by  the  Serious  Crimes  Unit  in  issuing  the indictments  of  East Timorese who  committed  crimes  in  September  1999  -  which  we  deem  important  -  the  Special Court established  to  this  effect  has  only  held  a  couple  of  trials  of  former  militia coming  from  West  Timor.

 During  the  three  years  of  reconciliation  experience, from  the  Bali  and  Baucau meetings  in  2000  to  the  sequence  of  border  meetings between  former  militias  and their  own  communities  in  East Timor,  we  were steadfast  in  holding  to  the principle that  there  would  be  no  reconciliation without  justice  and,  raising  the  idea  of  a national  amnesty  policy  that  would  cover  those  who  had  undergone  trial.

 However,  we  still  face  strong  opposition  from  former  militia  who  have  influence over the  more  than  thirty  thousand  refugees  remaining  in  West  Timor  and  who  call  for  a plain  amnesty.  The  Special  Court  will still have  to  wait  to  initiate  a  continuous  and comprehensive  justice  process  covering  the  East  Timorese  who  were  involved  in  the

 1999  violence.

 Ladies  end  Gentlemen,

 I must  say  that  the  causes  of  instability,  the  first  aforementioned cause, are  a product  of  the  policy  of  tolerance  and  National  Unity, within the  spirit  o f

 reconciliation,  adopted  by  CNRT  at  the  beginning  of  the  transition  process,  together with  UNTAET.  This  policy  stopped  us  from  recruiting  resistance  cadres  and  youth  just for  the  sake  of  having  committed  themselves  to  the  struggle  more  than  others.

 4

 Those  same  people,  today, watch others who  were  never very sympathetic  to  the resistance,  take  over  jobs  or  finding  a  livelihood,  on  behalf  of  democracy  and tolerance  and,  the  outcome  is  frustration  taking  over  the  mind  and  spirits.

 It  is  important  for  the  future  peace  and  stability  to  address the needs  of  all those who committed their  lives  to  the  struggle.   Just  a  few days  before  leaving  East Timor,  two  former  Falintil  commanders  who  fought  for  24  years  in  the  jungle,  came to  see  me  in  the  office  in  Dili.  With  tears  in  their  eyes,  they  told  me  that  more  than 20 former  Falintil  combatants, who have  joined  other  groups  to  destabilise  the government,  are  now  in  the  jungle  and  enter  the  villages  to  extort  the  population.

 For many  former  Falintil  guerrilla  soldiers  there  is  a  certain  lack  of  meaning  to freedom and independence  -  after  24  years  of  struggle  they  are  saying  “had  I known  that  it  would  come  to  this”.  This  is  the  frustration  of  people who fought  s o

 long for freedom and independence and now  do  not  experience  a  significant change  in  their  lives.  The  struggle  is  over,  they  are  left  without purpose, without meaning, without jobs, without  a  pension, and without skills  (other  than  guerrilla warfare)  to  start  a  new  life.

 They  need  some  recognition  so  as  to  be  proud  of  their  past  deeds.  Besides  many widows  and  orphans,  some  of  them  have  been  left disabled,  unable  to  provide  for the  education  of  their  children.

 For  these  reasons  the  Presidency  has  established  two  Commissions  to  deal  with  the question  of  Former  Combatants  and  Veterans  of  Falintil,  including  the  families  of those  who  died.   These  two  Commissions  have  already  initiated  their  work  with  the objective  of  collecting  data  and  establishing  a  database  in  order  to,  in  the  near future,  begin  thinking  of  ways  to  pay  homage  and  give  recognition  to  them  for  their role  in  the  struggle,  and  how  to  assist  them  to  have  a  normal  life  within  their communities.

 There  is  also  an  organisation,  which  I  set  up  straight  after  the  dissolution  of  the CNRT  in  June  2001,  to  assist  the  cadres  of  the  clandestine  resistance,  called  AVR (Association  of  Resistance  Veterans).

 We  face  the  need for social reconciliation  and  a  reconciliation  of  minds.  We  are aware  that  only  an  adequate economic development plan  can  override  the instability  risks  of  the  future.  I  personally  do  not believe that  we  would  ensure stability just  by  putting  every  former  militia  in  jail. The dozens  or  hundreds  o f people  we  will sentence will  be  an  added burden  on  the government, not only because  of  infrastructure needs but also because  of  the funding  necessary  to  pay for staff  and  food.  The  government was compelled  to  increase  taxes  by  20% because there  is  no  alternative  income  source.  People tend  to  forget  that  we  are dependent  on  the  assistance  provided  by  the  international  community  and  that  the one  hundred  and  fifty million  dollars  pledged  for Timor-Leste are  not  enough  to cover  the  country’s  development  needs.

 I  meet  twice  a  month  with  dozens  of  people  who raise their  daily  problems: lack  o f jobs,  lack  of  food,  lack  of  money  to  pay  school  fees  or  to  see  their  children  through University  or,  to  pay  for  the  diploma  itself.

 On  the  other  hand,  our prisons are full  of  people who charged with petty crimes awaiting  trial  because  our  courts  are  unable  to  cope  with  the  demand.

 5

 Nevertheless, when  I  identified  economic  development  as  the number  one  priority for  Timor-Leste,  East  Timorese  human  rights  organisations  still  considered  justice  a priority  that  must  override  development.

 I believe there are  only  two alternatives  regarding  the second  cause  of  instability: armed  incursions.  One  is  to  increase  dramatically  the number  and  the  quality  o f our  armed  forces’  weaponry,  but  we  do  not  wish  to  take this  path.  The  second  one is to postpone indefinitely the  PKF  withdrawal  until  the  former  militia  decide  to return voluntarily  and  face  justice  or  give  up  their  attempts  to  destabilise  the country.

 Many  people  do  not  consider  the  practical  issues  of  our  current  situation  and  those in  medium  term,  that  do  not  enable  us  to  resolve  our  problems. However,  they  still demand  that  we  meet  their  expectations.

 Ladies  and  gentlemen, We  cannot  build  meaningful  reconciliation  without  a  solid  human  rights  foundation.

 South  Africa  is  a  good  example  to  us  of  a  country,  which, coming  from  a  history  o f human  rights  violations,  has  received  international  credibility  due  to  its embrace  o f a  human  rights  culture  and  leading  the  field  in  many  respects  in  this  regard.

 But,  De  Klerk  and  P.  W.  Botha  were never imprisoned when apartheid  was considered  a  crime against  humanity.  In  Portugal,  for example, after forty eight years  of  fascism,  there  was  sufficient  political  courage  for  a  general  amnesty,  after the Carnation  Revolution  in  April 1974.  At  the  time  it  created  much  internal controversy,  but  today  the  people and  the  average Portuguese citizen remember the  past,  not  with  trauma,  but  as  an  experience  in  their  history  that  they  would  not

 wish  to  see  repeated.

 At times,  it  is  difficult  to  understand that  we  want  to  put  pain  behind  us.   Since January  2001,  I  have  been  stating  that  the  International Tribunal  is  not  a  priority for Timor-Leste.   Recently,  many  human  rights organizations wrote  to  m e expressing  their  disagreement  with  my  “statement”  on  the  notorious  indictments.

 When speaking  of  victims,  I  must  say  that  I  witnessed  the  bombings,  by  air,  s e a and  land  and  I  saw pieces  of  human  flesh  nailed  to  the  trees,  thrown against  the rocks  and  spread  out  on  the  ground.  I  watched,  impotently,  dozens  of  people

 buried  in  the  caves  that  crumbled  as  a  result  of  the  bombings;  I  saw rotten  and abandoned  bodies  because  nobody  had  the  time  to  bury  them.

 I must  remind  you  that  I  also  know  of  several  cases  of  massacres  and  I  followed the  cases  of  imprisonment  of  various  companions who, one  by  one,  were taken  at night  and  disappeared.

 I  saw  the  best  guerrilla  commanders and combatants fall,  and  I  cried  countless times.

 However,  I  must  emphasise that, despite all  this,  the  people were prepared  to accept  further  sacrifices.   And  the  sacrifices  were understood  because  of  ideals  - independence,  liberation.

 I  know  that  all  I  have  said  does  not  clear anyone  of  having  committed  a  crime.

 But,  for  me  and  many  Timorese,  the  greatest, the  best  Justice  that  was done,  was the  ending  of  the  people’s  suffering,  through  the  opportunity  of  exercising  the  right to  decide  one’s  own  destiny.

 6

 It is normal that,  in  post-conflict  situations,  trauma  (supposedly collective,  as  in the  whole  society)  is  emphasised  as  the  worst thing  to  be  confronted,  as  though  it is  a  ‘sine  qua  non’  condition  for  the  resurrection  of  the  people  for  the  new  process.

 And  when  we  speak  about  reconciliation,  it  is  almost  a  crime  not  to  speak  of  justice and  many  argue  that  it  clashes  with  ethics  and  morals  (in relation  to  justice  for  the sake  of  justice).  And  trauma  is  upheld  today  as  the  sword  of  human  rights.

 When  we  claim  justice  on  behalf  of  the  victims,  we  are  being  led  by  a  feeling  o f revenge,  in  that  the  criminals  have  to  pay  for  what  they  did.

 Within Timor-Leste,  we  lose  the memory  of  the  sacrifices  accepted  during  the struggle  and  the  notion  of  nation  building  in  the  complexity  of  its problems,  and limit  the  process  to  a  factor,  that  is  trauma,  which  is  not  ever  lasting  nor  incurable.

 Our  people  learned  of  human  rights through  the  violations  of  human  rights.   They understood the meaning  of  freedom  through  the  repression  in  which they lived, they  understood  the  lack  of  freedom  through  the  regime  that  persecuted, arrested, tortured  and  killed  them.

 We  have  already  overcome  this period.   Today, there  is  a  fundamental need that our people acquire  the  knowledge  of  the positive  side  of  human rights  -  the  right to  housing,  the  right  to  freedom  of  speech,  of  association  and assembly, the right to  employment,  the  right  to  participate  and  decide,  etc...

 In Timor-Leste, the educated society  awards  an  excessive attention  to  cases  o f human rights violations, such  as  arrest  without  evidence.  There  were cases  where the release  of  individuals  arrested  for taking part  in  an  armed  assault  or  in activities which threatened the  security  of  the  population, was immediately demanded,  because  their  capture/arrest  was  an  abuse  of  human  rights.   And  when the question was raised  of  the  human rights  of  those  people killed and  of  the population  which  lived  in  fear  and  could  not  even  work  in  their  fields,  resulting  in  a loss  of  production  to  provide  for  their  families, the response was  in  those  cases,  it is  not  considered  a  violation  of  human  rights  but  simply  a  ‘crime’.

 I  think  that  there  is  really  a  specific  type  of  trauma  in  the  more  educated Timorese society, when dealing with human rights issues.   I  see  the  other  face  o f

 traumatized reality inside  and  outside  of  Timor-Leste  -  many  people  do  not  want to  recognize  that  trauma  exists,  that  there  are  violations  of  human  rights,  in  their own spirits, when  the  victims  themselves are concerned with how to survive  in  the difficult  times  of  independence.

 Human  rights  must  be  the  solid  foundation upon which social justice  is  built.   With Social  justice,  these  rights  will  acquire  a  socio-economic and  cultural  dimension.   It is  not  feasible  for  Timor-Leste  to  provide  adequate  shelter,  education,  employment and  health  care  to  all  citizens  immediately. Nevertheless,  we  should  work towards achieving  these  rights  progressively  by  creating  the  conditions  by  which people  can realise  their  own  rights  through  their  skills  and  initiative.   A  rights-based society  is one  in  which discrimination  is  eliminated  and  equal  opportunity  is  given  for individuals  to  flourish.

 Our  society  experienced  the  absence  of  human  rights  and  suffered  violations.  Now, we need  to  experience  the  other  side  of  human rights.  The  people  in  the villages and  mountains  need  to  learn  what  human  rights  are  so  as  to  be  able  to  experience them  and,  thus,  effect  change  in  society.

 The  Presidency  of  Timor-Leste decided  to  undertake  (and  has  already  initiated)  a broad campaign for  a  debate  at  national  level  on  local  governance and  the

 7

 mechanisms for  the  electoral  process.   Such mechanisms will  be  put  to  the consideration  of  the Government,  in  order  to  begin  drafting  the  necessary legal framework.

 The  kind  of  participation  we  expect  from  citizens,  individually,  and  from  the  people, within  the  communities,  must  be  a  conscientious  one  and  not  just  appear  to  be.

 It  will  only  be  conscientious  when  people  have  an  exact  notion  of  their  rights,  as  a n individual  and  as  part  of  a  wider  society.   Only  when  people  know  of  the  magnitude of  their  rights  and  the  dimension  of  their  duties, can  they  be  capable  of  assessing their  own  development  projects  and  government  programs.

 Only  thus,  will the elections,  held  every  five  years,  have  an  impact  on  programs presented  by  politicians  or  by  political  parties.   Only  thus,  will elections  b e conscious acts  of  choice  by  the  citizen.  Otherwise,  elections will not  be  but  a mechanism  to  choose  who  has  greater  financial  capacity  to  mobilize the people  for rallies,  giving  a  false  impression  of  greatness  and misleading the population  to vote  for  people  without  clear  programs,  without  ideas  and  without  vision.

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen,

 Our  new  democracy not  only  aspires  to  uphold  principles  of  international  law  and act  in  accordance with international law,  but   aims  to  enhance  the  role  o f

 international law  as  part  of  the  law  of  Timor-Leste  -  and  so  doing,  to  serve  as  a safeguard  against  the  repetition  of  the  atrocities  of  the  past.

 Last  year  -  on  10  December  -  on  International  Human  Rights  Day  -  I  signed  a document  committing  Timor-Leste  to  a  package  of  international  human  rights treaties that  have  sprung  from  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights, including  the  International  Convention  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights;  the

 International  Convention  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  Rights;  and  the Convention against Torture  and  Other  Cruel,  Inhuman  or  Degrading  Treatment  or Punishment.

 With  its  new  Constitution,  Timor-Leste  stands  on  the threshold  of  a  new  era  in  the history  of  democratic  state  formation.   However,  there  is  no  historical  law that directs  that  the  principles,  values  and  institutions  enshrined  in  the  new Constitution will  inevitably  lead  to  a  happy  future,  but,  at  least  for  the  first  time  in  the  country’s history,  the  basis  and  orientation  is  different  and  sound.  The  ratification  o f

 international  treaties  and  conventions  is,  however,  no  more  than  a  starting  point.

 Timor-Leste  is  a  new  state.   Tremendous challenges and  institution  building  awaits our  country  on  many  fronts.  To  secure  the  democracy  and  the  fundamental human rights  we  have  so  long  fought  for,  we  need  to  build  a  fair  and  effective  system  o f law  and  order,  justice  and  good  governance.

 The  UN  Transitional  Administration  proceeded  to  create  four  District Courts, appointed  East  Timorese  judges,  prosecutors  and  public  defenders  and  put  in  place a transitional  legal  system.  Consequently, many  of  the  key  court actors entered

 into  an  emergency court system with minimal training, little experience, and  the effective  absence  of  an  operational  court  administration.

 Although there  is  a  strong  commitment  to  human  rights,  in  practice  the  justice system  is  steering  dangerously  close  to  falling  below  minimum international standards.   The  new  judiciary  must  be  able  to  uphold  such standards  if  they  are  to earn  the  public  confidence  necessary  for  a  society  based  on  the  rule  of  law.

 8

 To uphold  democracy  and  human  rights  we  need  a  strong  and  independent judiciary.  If  the  justice  system  fails  to  meet  international  human  rights  standards,  it will not  be  able  to  fulfil  its important role  in  establishing the  rule  of  law  and

 overcoming  a  legacy  of  impunity  and  selective  justice.

 A functioning court administration  is  part  of  the  institutional  basis  of  the

 fundamental right  to  a  fair  trial  before  a  competent,  independent, and impartial tribunal.   Particular  elements  of  this  right  are  currently  affected  by  the  lack  of  a n effective administration. The right  to  a  public  hearing  is  undermined  by  access problems,  including  access  to  information  about  the  court  proceedings.

 These concerns  have  broader  implications  for  the  building  of  a  sustainable  justice system that  enjoys  the  public  trust and confidence that  is  necessary for  a  society based  on  the  rule  of  law  and  respect  for  human  rights.

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen

 An important safeguard  of  a  fair  trial  is  the  right  to  appeal  to  ensure  judicial scrutiny  of  a  court’s  decision  at  a  higher  level.  To  secure  the  right  to  appeal  our Constitution provides for  the  establishment  of  a  Court  of  Appeal  as  an  interim measure  pending  the  creation  of  a  Supreme Court  and  Supreme Council  of  the Judiciary.

 We  are  now  working  on  the  establishment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal.   Due  to  the lack of  human  resources,  in  terms  of  experienced  judges,  we  will not  have  a  High  Court yet. Nevertheless,  although  not being the  High  Court,  the  Court  of  Appeal, will temporarily  assume  the  competencies  of  the  High  Court,  in  its constitutional duties and  will  have  the  task  of  judicial  scrutiny  of  the  judicial  system.

 I  have  already  appointed  the  President  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  and  am  now waiting for  the  ratification  by  the  Parliament, whose endorsement will give  the  necessary authority  and  strengthen  the  body  to  act  properly.

 Timor-Leste  is  a  small  country, with a low crime  rate,  which could  be  served  by  a relatively,  small,  effective  judiciary  supported  by  an  efficient  court  administration.

 There  needs  to  be  substantial  reforms  of  the  court  administration, including significantly improved resource mobilisation and co-ordinated training  and mentoring  of  East  Timorese  staff.  

 We  have  been  faced  with  a  rare  opportunity  to  make the  most  of  the  “clean  slate” situation  in  1999  by  trying  to  establish best practices  in  the  justice  system.   W e need  to  seize  what remains  of  this opportunity before problems become

 entrenched  and  then  all  the  more  difficult  to  change.

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen,

 All  that  has  been  said  above,  merely  constitutes  our commitment  to  peace  and stability.   But  Timor-Leste  must  not  isolate  itself  from  the  world.   However,  in  order to  reach  out  to  the  world,  Timor-Leste, has  Australia,  close  by  to  its south  and shares  a  land  border  with Indonesia,  besides  having  an  enclave  within Indonesian West  Timor.

 Timor-Leste has  a  long,  and  of  course  complex history with Indonesia. Since  the trauma  of  the  war,  much  has  been  done  by  both  sides  to  put  this  relationship  on  a new  and  positive  footing.

 At  a  people  to  people  level,  amongst  civil society, Timorese and Indonesians have never stopped talking. Indonesia’s human rights community  has  deep  links  with Timor’s  human  rights community.  We  also  maintain  economic  relations  with Indonesia, where  the  scale  weighs  favourably  towards Indonesian products, because they  are  cheaper  and  because  we  lack industries.   And  I  must  mention, that  we  have  thousands  of  youths  studying  at  Indonesian  universities.

 At  the  state-to-state  level,  both  countries  have  been  focused  on  reconciliation  which is  forward  looking.

 In November  1999  we  went  to  Jakarta  and  met  with the Indonesian Government. We  told  them:  “we  came  here  to  tell  you,  the  past  is  the  past.   These two decades of  conflict  between  us  was  a  tragic  historical  mistake”.

 In 2000, Indonesia’s President Wahid acknowledged the  results  of  the  Popular Consultation  -  and  through  him  the  Indonesian Parliament  -  this signalled  a  new and  historic  step  in  relations  between  Indonesia and Timor-Leste.   President Wahid’s visit  to  Timor-Leste  in  2000, was  a  much appreciated  symbol  of  a  new relationship.

 On  our  Independence Day  last  year  on  20  May,  Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri displayed political courage  and  real  statesmanship and honoured  u s in attending our independence celebration.    The  courage  of  President  Megawati  -and  the  symbolism  of  her presence  to  celebrate  with East Timorese leaders  and people  -  showed  tremendous spirit  on  her  part.  On  entering the stage, thousands of  East  Timorese spontaneously erupted with applause and  clapping.  President Megawati  stole  the  show  on  Independence  Day,  arriving  with the  largest  delegation from Jakarta.  The  incredibly  warm welcome  that  President Megawati received showed  that  the  East  Timorese  people  spontaneously  understood  the significance of  her  presence  as  the symbol  of  a  new relationship, and that  they  are  extremely open  to  new  peaceful  relations  with Indonesia and, appreciated and acknowledged this  act  of  courage.

 In July last year, within two months after  our  Independence,  I  paid  a  State  Visit  to Indonesia where  I  was  warmly  received  by  Her Excellency President Megawati Sukarnoputri,  her  cabinet,  the  Parliament,  and  the  people  of  Indonesia.  

 I  can  tell  you  that  a  very  special  and  mutually  respectful  relationship  has

 developed  between  East  Timor  and  Indonesia.

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen,

 Timor-Leste has  shared  a  long  history with Australia.   The  relationship  between Australia  and  Timor-Leste  is  not  only  about  the  emergency  of  September  1999  or about  the  solidarity  network  in  the  years  before.

 This relationship  is  the  history  of  neighbouring countries  and  friends  who support each  other.   It  is  also  about  the  magnanimous contribution  of  ordinary  people  in extraordinary  circumstances.

 Our  close  relationship started  in  the  Second  World  War  when Timor-Leste was  the frontline  in  the  defence  of  Australia.

 In recent times,  Australia  has  clearly aligned itself with its Asian neighbours.   Part of  this  recognition  is  that  Indonesia  is  the  single  largest  key  neighbour  for  Australia and  so  for  many  years  Australia  has  sought  to  build  a  strong  relationship with Indonesia.  At  various  times  over  the  years,  Australia  has  seen Timor-Leste differently.

 Australian  Prime  Minister  John  Howard made  a  bold  and courageous decision  in leading the international force  that  secured  peace  in  East Timor  in  September 1999.   This  had  implications  for Australia’s own important relationship with Indonesia.

 Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  visit  to  Jakarta  in  April  last  year,  clearly  indicates that a good  relationship  with Timor-Leste does not preclude good  relations  with Indonesia.

 We  are  committed  to  strengthening  ties  with  Australia.

 Ladies  and  Gentlemen,

 For  the  future  of  Timor-Leste,  it  is  important  that  we  begin  to  think  now  of  our  role in  the  region.

 We  see  that  the  West  Pacific  Forum,  that  has  as  partners,  essentially Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea  and  Timor-Leste, can become  an  instrument  for great  opportunities.  

 There  is  the  idea  of  a  formation  of  a  peripheral  sub-regional  co-operation  which would involve  the  Northern  Territory  (Australia), PNG, Sabah  (Malaysia),  South Mindanao  (Philippines),  Timor-Leste  and  the  eastern  part  of  Indonesia.

 I should say  that,  in  this  context,  we  will ensure  a  special  relationship  with  NTT province  of  Indonesia  and,  in  particular,  with  West  Timor.

 Within  this  sub-regional frame, and  above  all, with the eastern part  of  Indonesia, we  will  have  greater  perspective  on  economic  co-operation,  in  terms  o f

 infrastructure development, communication, fisheries  and  tourism,  as  well  as  in regards  to  improving  security mechanisms  to  prevent  drug  trafficking,  illegal smuggling  of  people  and  arms,  and  finally,  a  better  cultural  exchange.

 Timor-Leste  lies  at  a  crossroads  between  South-East  Asia  and  the  Pacific.

 Growing interdependence among countries  and  regions  in  this  era  of  globalisation and  changing  geopolitical  situation  makes  it  vitally necessary for  us  to  strengthen further interregional  co-operation.  This co-operation will  be  developed  at  a  State level.

 In  the  next  few  years,  as  we  are  busy  consolidating our democratic  institutions  and building  the  foundations  of  peace  and  stability,  we  wish  to  obtain  observer  status  in the  various  regional  institutions  such  as  the  Pacific  Islands Forum,  in  order  to  get acquainted  with  the  realities,  challenges  and  opportunities  offered.

 We  are  seeking  observer  status  in  that  very  important  regional  body,  ASEAN, whose members have  given  us  unqualified support.  In  the  long  term,  we  hope  to  b e accepted  as  a  member.   There  will  be  an  ASEAN  summit  in  2004  hosted  by Indonesia.   It  is  our desire that Timor-Leste will  be  accepted  as  an  observer supported  by  the  Indonesian  Government.

 In  conclusion,  I  must  state  that  for  this  general  co-operation  to  produce  effects  and impacts  beyond  the  much  needed, yet limited,  economic  co-operation,  security, infrastructure,  and  information  sharing,  we  also  need  to  develop  a  deeper  human co-operation.   Person-to-person  and community-to-community  exchanges  are  a sound  and  effective  means towards mutual understanding,  to  acquire greater

 11

 mutual  knowledge  and,  consequently,  to  ensure  peace  and  stability,  not  only  in Timor-Leste  but  between  Timor-Leste  and  its  regional  neighbours.

 This will be the small  contribution  Timor-Leste can make  to  peace  and  stability  in the  world.

 Thank  you.
