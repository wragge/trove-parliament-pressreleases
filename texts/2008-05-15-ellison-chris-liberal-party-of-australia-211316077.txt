 Senator the Hon. Christopher Ellison  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 “Immigration Minister sends a welcome message to people smugglers”   

 The Coalition Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Ellison today  said that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has sent a clear message to people  smugglers that Australia’s borders are open for business.    

 This week in his Budget media release the Minister said; ‘from early 2008-09, people found to  be refugees will receive a permanent visa, regardless of their mode of arrival’ (13/05/08).   

 ‘When asked in Question Time today about the serious and strong message this comment sends  to people smugglers, the Minster refused to acknowledge the significance of his comments,’ said  Senator Ellison.   

 ‘Questioned further as to whether the Minister could guarantee that there will be no increase in  unauthorised arrivals as a result of his comments the Minister refused to provide an answer,’ said  Senator Ellison.   

 The Coalition’s border protection policies effectively ceased the influx of illegal boat arrivals.  There were less than 250 boat arrivals after January 2002, compared to some 12,000 in the  preceding two-and-a-half years.    

 Senator Ellison said that the message sent by Minister Evans undermined the bipartisan  commitment to strong border protection.    

 ‘Government agencies are doing a very good job in defending Australia’s borders however the  statement by the Government that regardless of their mode of arrival people will receive a  permanent visa if they are found to be refugees, undermines this good work’, said Senator  Ellison.   

 Australia is a compassionate and generous country, but we believe in a proper orderly migration  program. The success of the Coalition’s Border Protection policies enabled Australia to commit  to resettling 13,000 people each year as in need of refugee and humanitarian aid.    

 The Coalition does not believe in rewarding those so try to skip proper process nor will we  encourage the highly organised international criminal networks that treat human beings as cargo  to be put on unseaworthy vessels.
