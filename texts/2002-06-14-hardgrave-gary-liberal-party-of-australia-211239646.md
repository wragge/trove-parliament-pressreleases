 Second Generation Australians are High Achievers

 The 25- to 44-year-old children of migrants from Malaysia or China have the highest proportion of second generation Australians with university qualifications and in professional occupations, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, said today in Brisbane.

 Mr Hardgrave said a new study of second generation Australians - the Australian born children of immigrant parents - had shown that those whose parents arrived in Australia in the post-war years had achieved better educational and occupational outcomes than those with Australian-born parents.

 "The sacrifices, hard work and achievements of the parents may have been an inspiration for the children," Mr Hardgrave said.

 "With our skilled migration in place, in the future children will have an even better set of possibilities."

 Second generation Australians with parents from Asia or Southern and Eastern Europe had a higher proportion of people with university qualifications and in professional occupations than the second generation whose parents migrated from the UK or other Western European countries.

 "The contribution of all migrants to Australia is invaluable," Mr Hardgrave said.

 "It is important for our nation to embrace the benefits of cultural diversity and build on our strong record of social harmony."

 The study was commissioned by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and prepared by researchers at the Australian National University and Monash University.

 The research team used data primarily from the 1996 Census of Population and Housing to examine the second generation's educational attainment, employment status, occupational status, language and family patterns.

 "The 15- to 24-year-old second generation youth with parents born in Malaysia, China, Greece, Italy, Poland, Hungary or Lebanon are particularly likely to stay in school longer, proceed to tertiary study and obtain post-school qualifications," Mr Hardgrave said.

 For the 0- to 14-year-old age group, the report showed wide variation in the children's families' socio-economic status by origin. Children whose parents have migrated from countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and India are more likely to have well-educated, employed parents and live in high income households.

 Many immigrants from these countries are skilled or business migrants and this is reflected in their occupational status.

 "The most important finding for the 0- to 14-year old age group is that most children are proficient in English once they reach school age, regardless of their parents' English

 competency," Mr Hardgrave said.

 Mr Hardgrave said that in 1996 there were 3.4 million second generation Australians, about 20 per cent of the total population. The largest number were those with one or both parents born in the UK, a reflection of the UK as a major source of immigrants to Australia.

 "While the second generation of European origin whose parents immigrated in the 1950s and 1960s have reached adulthood, the second generation whose parents immigrated from Asian countries in the 1970s and 1980s were mostly still of school age at the time of the 1996 Census and the socio-economic outcomes for this group are not yet known."

 Second Generation Australians - Executive Summary

 [Demographic background] [The second generation aged 0-14 years] [The second generation aged 15-24 years] [The second generation aged 25-44 years] [Conclusions]

 The main objectives of this study are to examine the social, economic and demographic outcomes of second generation Australians, to compare them by their parents' national or ethnic origins and with their peers who are either first or at least third or more generations.

 Among the socioeconomic and demographic outcomes examined in the study are educational attainment, employment, occupational status, language shift and family formation patterns.

 The study also explores the issue of intergenerational mobility by examining whether the second generation's outcomes are related to their parents' socioeconomic background.

 The study is based primarily on data from the 1996 Census. The second generation is identified directly from census data on birthplace and parents' birthplace. In this study, the second generation is defined as persons born in Australia with one or both parents born in an overseas country.

 The second generation is examined according to the country of birth of both parents where both are born in the same country, or if not, the father's country of birth. Comparisons are also undertaken according to their parents' English proficiency country groupings (EP Groups), a classification developed by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA 1997) that takes account of the level of English proficiency of recent immigrants.

 The study takes a cohort approach in examining the second generation. It focuses on four specific age cohorts: children aged 0-14 years, youth aged 15-24, and adults aged 25-34 and 35-44 in 1996.

 These age cohorts are associated with different waves of immigration to Australia, with the younger cohorts including the children of Asian immigrants who arrived after 1975, while the older cohorts are predominantly of European origins, reflecting the post-war migration from Europe of the 1950s and 1960s.

 Demographic background

 In 1996 there were 3.4 million second generation Australians - about 20 per cent of the total population of 17.8 million. The largest number of second generation Australians are those with one or both parents born in the United Kingdom, a reflection of the UK as the largest source of immigrants to Australia. The second generation of European origins greatly outnumbered the second generation of non-European origins in 1996. They also outnumbered the first generation of European origins because immigration from Europe,

 aside from the UK, has slowed down considerably after 1970. The second generation of Asian origins is still smaller than the first generation, but its number is likely to increase because of continuing migration from Asian countries and the relatively young age structure of recent Asian migrants.

 The second generation aged 0-14 years

 Since this age group is too young for a study of their socioeconomic outcomes, the focus is on their family situation. Their living arrangements, the extent that English is spoken in the home, and the family's socioeconomic status - as indicated by parents' education and qualifications, employment and occupational status, household income and housing tenure - are examined by their parents' birthplace. The birthplace groups that are the focus of this chapter are mainly of non-European origins.

 Compared with the first and third or more generations, the second generation is more likely to live with both parents. The second generation of Asian origins - particularly those with parents born in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, India and Philippines - tends to have very high proportions living with both parents. The exception is the second generation of Vietnamese parents, where the proportion living with the mother only is higher than other Asian groups and suggests that difficulties in settlement may have contributed to their parents' marriage breakdown.

 The data show wide variation in the children's family's socioeconomic status by origin. Children whose parents have migrated from countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and India are more likely to have well educated, employed parents and live in high income households. Many immigrants from these countries are skilled or business migrants and this is reflected in their occupational status. In contrast, a significant proportion of children with parents from Lebanon, Turkey or Vietnam come from families of lower socioeconomic background, with fathers who are more likely to be employed in low skilled occupations or not employed at all. Immigration from these three countries has been largely characterised by family or refugee migration rather than skill migration.

 The most important finding for this age group is that most children are proficient in speaking English once they reach school age, regardless of their parents' English competency. Although a high proportion of children with parents born in Vietnam, China, Hong Kong, Lebanon or Turkey speak a language other than English at home and their parents are less proficient in English than other migrants, almost all of them can speak good English by age 10. This finding suggests that schools play an important role in the development of English language skills in children whose parents speak little or no English. Proficiency in English has been shown to be associated with positive labour market outcomes for immigrants (Cobb-Clark and Chapman 1999; Williams et al 1997; Wooden 1994). The English proficiency of almost all children in the second generation, regardless of their parents' English ability, holds promise of a successful integration into the labour market and Australian society when they read adult age.

 The second generation aged 15-24 years

 The second generation in this age group is in transition from education to work. Outcomes examined for this age group include enrolment in education for those aged 15-21 and qualifications for those aged 22-24, as well as labour force participation and employment outcomes for those aged 18-24. Since a large proportion of the second generation in this age group is still enrolled in secondary or tertiary study, the information on their occupational outcomes is likely to be still incomplete.

 A large proportion of the second generation aged 15-21 still live at home with parents. This makes it possible to examine their educational and employment outcomes in relation

  

 to their family's socioeconomic background, as indicated by residential location and father's or sole parent's occupational status. Second generation youth of Greek or Slav-Macedonian origin are the most likely to live with their parents.

 Almost all second generation youth are proficient in English even if they do not speak it as the only language at home. The second generation's enrolment rate in secondary or tertiary education is also significantly higher than that of youth who are at least third generation. Consequently, their proportion with post-school qualifications is also higher than that for their peers who are at least third generation. Second generation youth with parents born in Malaysia, China, Greece, Italy, Poland, Hungary or Lebanon are particularly likely to stay in school longer, proceed to tertiary study and obtain post-school qualifications. The second generation of UK or Western European origins is similar in these respects to Australians who are at least third generation.

 Because of their higher participation in education, the second generation has a lower participation rate in the labour force at these ages than their peers who are at least third generation. However, unemployment rates tend to be higher for the second generation who are in the work force than for the third generation, with the highest unemployment rate observed among the youth of Turkish or Lebanese origin.

 Another significant finding for the second generation in this age group is that those who come from families of lower socioeconomic background, as measured by father's occupation, are more likely to be enrolled in education than their third generation counterparts of similar socioeconomic background. The second generation living in middle or low income suburbs were also more likely to be enrolled in education than the third generation from the same suburbs, while there was no difference in educational participation between second and third generation youth who live in high socioeconomic status suburbs. These results indicate that second generation youth from lower socioeconomic background may have a greater capacity to overcome their disadvantage than their third generation peers by participating longer in education and obtaining post-school qualifications.

 The second generation aged 25-44 years

 Socioeconomic outcomes are clearer for this age group since they have completed their education and are in their prime working ages. The 1996 Census data confirm the findings of earlier studies that the second generation who are of most Southern or Eastern European origins have better educational and occupational outcomes than those of UK or Western European origins. Although small in number, the second generation of parents born in Malaysia or China has the highest proportion with university qualifications and in professional occupations. The second generation of Eastern European or Asian origins who are in managerial or professional occupations also have higher incomes.

 A large proportion of the second generation of Greek, Italian, Slav-Macedonian or Maltese origins live in homes that are owned by them or their family, particularly at ages 25-34. Other second generation groups with relatively high proportions living in owned homes are those with parents born in Lebanon, China or Poland. In contrast a smaller proportion of the second generation of British or Western European origins live in owned homes. The gap between them and the second generation of Southern European origins is smaller at age 35-44 than at age 25-34, as more of them become home owners in their late 30s and early 40s.

 Two age cohorts - those aged 25-34 and 35-44 in 1996 - are also examined using data from the 1986 and 1991 Censuses to track their socioeconomic outcomes over the ten-year period between 1986 and 1996. Generally, differences in the second generation's socioeconomic outcomes by origin are maintained over time as the cohort ages. However,

 the gap between the second and third or more generations in educational achievement widened for the cohort aged 15-24 in 1986 as they moved into the 25-34 age group in 1996. In contrast, differences in unemployment rates, occupational status and home ownership rates between the second and third or more generations became smaller as the cohorts became older as the Australian third generation caught up slightly in occupational status and home ownership rates.

 The cohort analyses also show a definite shift to speaking only English at home as the second generation becomes older, although differences by origin remain fairly large. Maintenance of the parents' language at home continues to be strong among the second generation of Greek origin, followed by those of Lebanese, Italian and Chinese origins even as they reach middle age.

 Family formation patterns are also examined for this age group. In terms of their partnering, marriage and fertility patterns, second generation Australians of UK origin are almost exactly the same as the third generation. The second generation with parents born in New Zealand, Ireland, Germany or Netherlands also shows patterns of behaviour that are similar to Australians of at least third generation, although the second generation of New Zealand origin is more likely to marry later and to be in cohabiting relationships than Australians who are at least third generation. In contrast the second generation of Mediterranean origins have a pattern of early marriage and low rates of cohabitation. The second generation of Southern European origins also has high rates of in-marriage.

 Second generation women have lower fertility on average than Australian women who are at least third generation. Only women of Dutch or Lebanese origin have higher fertility in the 25-34 age group and only women of Dutch or Maltese origin have higher fertility in the 35-44 age group than women who are at least third generation. Women of Chinese origin stand out as having the lowest fertility among the second generation. Other groups with low fertility are women of Greek or Italian origin who are more likely to delay the first birth and who also have very low rates of ex-nuptial fertility.

 Conclusions

 This study of socioeconomic outcomes of the second generation shows that the second generation as a group are doing or has done better than their peers who are at least third generation in terms of educational attainment and occupational status. However, there is also considerable diversity in outcomes by origin. The second generation of some Southern European, Eastern European and Asian origins are more likely to achieve better educational and occupation outcomes than those of other origins. The second generation of English-speaking or Western European origins are more similar to at least third generation Australians in their socioeconomic characteristics.

 There are also differences in language and cultural maintenance among the second generation by origin, as indicated by differences in the shift to speaking English only at home and in demographic behaviours such as ex-nuptial fertility, cohabitation and independent living. The second generation of Mediterranean or Asian origins are more likely to differ from the third or more generations in these demographic behaviours. However, almost all second generation youth are proficient in English regardless of their parents' level of English competency. This should help in their integration into Australian society and the labour market.

 As contended by Portes and Macleod (1996), the long-term prospects of ethnic communities created by contemporary immigration hinge on the second generation's social adaptation and educational success. Indeed achievement of this end, the future benefit of their children, is often the motivating factor of the migration of the first generation. With this strong motivation on the part of their parents, it is perhaps no

 surprise that most second generation groups perform better in educational outcomes than their peers who are at least third generation. The study has also shown that in circumstances where the parental generation is economically disadvantaged, the second generation seems more able to overcome this disadvantage - through greater participation in education and achievement of tertiary qualifications - than their peers who are at least third generation.

 The census data used in this study are not able to explain the reasons for the better socioeconomic outcomes of the second generation compared to the third generation. Nor are they able to explain the diversity in outcomes by origin among the second generation. More detailed survey data are needed to examine the factors associated with particular country of origin groups that have an impact on the second generation outcomes observed in this study.

 While conclusions can be drawn about the socioeconomic outcomes of the second generation of European origins whose parents immigrated during the 1950s and 1960s, it is still premature to assess the socioeconomic outcomes of the second generation of non-European origins whose parents immigrated after 1975. There are clear signs that the second generation of Asian origins whose parents immigrated before 1970 has done well in terms of gaining university qualifications. However, they are small in number and their parents are a select group of immigrants from only a few Asian countries. The vast majority of second generation Australians of non-European origins are children of immigrants who arrived after 1975. They have more diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Although there are clear indications that these second generation youth are remaining in the education system longer than their peers who are at least third generation, it will be another five to ten years before their socioeconomic outcomes will be fully known. There is a need therefore for continuing research on second generation Australians.
