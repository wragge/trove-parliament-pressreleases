 DISINTEREST IN IMPORTANT REFUGEE BILL

 The Government's failure to provide a quorum in the House of Representatives this  afternoon to enable continued consideration of The Migration Legislation shows  their lack of real commitment to their own legislation.

 The government claims that the Bill is urgently required in order that Chinese  asylum seekers cannot seek refugee status on the basis of China's fertility control  policy as members of a social group.

 As a ploy to ensure the Bill cannot be used as a double dissolution trigger if  opposed, it was introduced into the House of Representatives. Despite its national  and questionable political importance the Government failed to ensure it's continued  consideration.

 The proceedings in the House of Representatives collapsed in extraordinary  circumstances when the quorum was called by a Government member.
