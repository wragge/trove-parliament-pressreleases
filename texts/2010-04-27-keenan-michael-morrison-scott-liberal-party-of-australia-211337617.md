 Business as usual for people smugglers under Kevin Rudd as boat K115  arrives 27/04/10 

 The arrival of another boat, K115, within just 24 hours shows it is business as usual for people smugglers under Kevin  Rudd, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and  Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “The arrival of the 115th boat since Kevin Rudd rolled back the Coalition’s strong border protection regime is the  second arrival within 24 hours. Based on estimates provided by the Department of Immigration, this latest boat,  carrying 41 passengers and 4 crew, will cost taxpayers in excess of $3.3 million,” Mr Morrison said.

 “It is business as usual for people smugglers under Kevin Rudd, with Australian taxpayers continuing to foot the bill,”  he said.

 “On the long weekend Kevin Rudd set a new record for the number of people arriving illegally by boat to seek asylum,  in a financial year. With costs having already blown out by more than $130 million this year, it is not unreasonable to  expect further cost increases of more than $200 million before the year is out.

 “Kevin Rudd’s announcement to suspend the assessment of asylum claims has been denounced by refugee  advocates and people smugglers alike, as being both ineffective and inhumane.

 “Kevin Rudd’s cynical election fix will now likely face court challenge as well as further increasing costs with the  reopening of the Curtin detention centre closed by the Howard Government.

 “The continued arrival of boats shows people are prepared to wait out Kevin Rudd’s  suspension until after an election,  when if Labor is re-elected, they will be able to access Kevin Rudd’s permanent protection visas once again,” Mr  Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “I am looking forward to visiting Christmas Island this week to assess the situation first hand.

 “Following the arrival of two boats in two days, the staff at Christmas Island will surely be operating above and beyond  the call of duty.

 “Like Customs, the Navy and the Australian Federal Police, they are at the front line dealing with the consequences of  the policy mistakes Kevin Rudd and Labor have made in Canberra,” he said.
