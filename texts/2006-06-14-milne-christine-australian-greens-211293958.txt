 Howard government blind to climate security threat: Greens 

 

 Senator Milne, 14th June 2006   

 The Howard government has failed to grasp the security implications posed by  climate change, leaving Australia and the region exposed, Australian Greens climate  change spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said today.    

 "While the Pentagon has long since recognised abrupt climate change as having dire  national security implications for the United States, the Howard government is blind  to similar implications in the Asia Pacific region," Senator Milne said in Canberra.    

 "Climate change is just not on the Howard government's radar.    

 "Rising sea levels and associated storm surges could lead to flooding highly populated  regions and massive relocation as occurred after Hurricane Katrina in the US. Food  and water shortages, and associated homelessness and displacement are a recipe for  civil disorder in our region.    

 "The Howard government has already rejected the idea of recognising climate  refugees - sending a hostile message to Pacific Island neighbours who face rising seas  and the prospect of forced relocation and a loss of cultural identity.  

 

 "During Budget Estimates hearings neither the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Trade nor the minister at the table, Senator Helen Coonan, nor the Ambassador for the  Environment, Ms Jan Adams, had any idea about the geopolitical implications of  climate change in our region.    

 "Responding to my questions, the department said that, unlike the United States, it  was not conducting any analysis or report on the national security implications of  climate change in our region.    

 "Senator Coonan went so far as to say: 'I am not quite sure from what perspective you  mean.'    

 "The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Howard government must take  note of the report released today by Dr Alan Dupont from the Lowy Institute. The  report highlights all of the climate-related security issues that The Greens have been  warning about for a decade.    

 "Instead of throwing in a reference to climate change to try to legitimise a desire to be  part of the nuclear club, the Prime Minister should try to understand the greatest  security threat of this century."    

 The Greens will move a motion in Parliament this afternoon to establish a Senate  inquiry into the best energy mix for Australia given the need to make deep greenhouse  gas emission cuts.
