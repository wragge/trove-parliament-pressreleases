 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 04 021 24 March 2004 

 Australia Boosts Assistance for Refugees in  the Asia-Pacific 

 Australia is contributing $12.6 million to the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to fund its efforts in protecting and  assisting refugees and asylum seekers, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

 The UNHCR is one of Australia's key international partners in implementing  programs to assist refugees and asylum seekers.

 Our contribution consists of $7.3 million to UNHCR's Annual Program Budget  for 2004 to support its worldwide mandate to protect and assist refugees and to  seek long-term solutions to the challenges of large-scale people movements.

 Australia also is contributing $5.3 million from AusAID's International Refugee  Fund for UNHCR assistance to urban refugees and asylum seekers in the Asia-Pacific region.

 Urban refugees and asylum seekers, unlike those in refugee camps, often don't  have access to public services such as health care and education. Neither do they  have the opportunity to earn a living.

 Australia's contribution will allow UNHCR to deliver increased protection and  assistance in Hong Kong, India, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, East Timor,  Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and China.

 Australia's increased assistance will target highly vulnerable groups, including  separated children, the elderly, single-parent and large families awaiting refugee  status determination.

 By providing assistance to these vulnerable groups, we reduce the incentive for  them to undertake hazardous journeys to other countries within the region. 



 Mr Downer will be meeting the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud  Lubbers, in Canberra on 24 March 2004.
