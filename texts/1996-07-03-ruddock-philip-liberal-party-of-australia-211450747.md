 1996-97 Humanitarian Program  

 Australia's 1996-97 Humanitarian Program will consist of a total of 12 000 offshore places  and 2 000 onshore places, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip  Ruddock, announced today.  

 "This includes the 2 000 offshore places already brought forward or borrowed from the  Program by the former Government and compares with the original Program of 13 000  offshore places for 1995-96," Mr Ruddock said.  

 "In its election commitments, the Government stated it would maintain a separate  Humanitarian Program and not reduce the refugee component of that Program. We have  delivered on that commitment because we take our international obligations very seriously."  

 The Humanitarian Program will have three components:  

 â¢ Refugee: for people who meet the United Nations Convention definition of a refugee  - 3 335 places have been allocated, in addition to the 665 places brought forward and  already taken (a total of 4 000);  

 â¢ Special Humanitarian Program: for people who have suffered discrimination or  other violations of their human rights but are not refugees - 2 133 places have been  allocated in addition to the 667 places already taken (a total of 2 800); and,  

 â¢ Special Assistance Category: for those in vulnerable positions overseas and who  have close links with Australia - 4 532 places have been allocated, in addition to the  668 places already taken (a total of 5 200).  

 The Refugee and Special Humanitarian categories remain unchanged from the original 1995-96 levels, after taking into account the bring forward. The reduction of 1 000 places in the net  level is in the Special Assistance Category, reflecting an easing of conflicts and tension in  areas of the world addressed by this category.  

 "Priority in the Humanitarian Program will continue to be given to the regions of the former  Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Africa," Mr Ruddock said.  

 "Those in the greatest need will be assisted. Our priorities take close account of the needs for  humanitarian resettlement identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and communities within Australia."  

 "I have recently reviewed the Special Assistance Category and have begun considering the  detailed allocation of places, based on the international situation and community support."  

 The 2 000 places allocated onshore will provide for the estimated number of people granted  permanent residence as a result of meeting the United Nations' refugee criteria in Australia.  Should on-shore grants exceed 2 000, the excess will be absorbed into the offshore program, 

 so that humanitarian resettlement services can properly meet needs.
