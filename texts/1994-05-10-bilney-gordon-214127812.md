 MAJOR INCREASE IN OVERSEAS AID

 Australia's international development efforts and growing engagement in the Asia-Pacific  region have been bolstered by an $82 million increase in overseas aid, the Minister for  Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 "This is a real increase o f 3.6% —  a significant achievement in the current economic  circumstances," M r Bilney said.

 The increase takes Australia's development cooperation expenditure for 1994-95 to $1,486.5  million, or 0.34 per cent o f GNP —  the same ratio as in 1993-94 and above the OECD  weighted average.

 M r Bilney said, "This renewed support for international development emphasises our  partnership with the countries o f the region. It recognises Australia's need to continue to  strengthen our economic, cultural and political involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, 

 especially through building people to people links.

 "Aid activities involve a wide range o f Australians, from business people to volunteers and  from fanners to schools and churches. All o f these groups and individuals are vital to building  diverse relationships between Australia and other nations and delivering the best development  cooperation possible."

 M r Bilney said the budget increases were carefully targeted to priority areas including health,  the environment, emergency relief, agricultural research, non government organisations and  private sector development. Increased aid funding would help reduce poverty both directly  and indirectly by stimulating economic growth, strengthening regional development 

 cooperation and meeting basic needs. ..

 M r Bilney said funding for health programs would be almost doubled, reflecting a greater  emphasis on basic needs. The increased health funding included an extra $110 million over the  next four years for programs in the South Pacific and Asia which would save up to 200,000  lives over four years.

 Australia would increase substantially its contribution to the international campaign to  eradicate polio and neo-natal tetanus by the end o f the century. Polio paralysed some 100,00  children each year, while tetanus was responsible for the death o f a newborn child every  minute.

 Greater assistance would also be provided to combat malaria which affected more than one  million people in our region every year and increased action would be taken to improve the  identification, treatment and prevention o f the spread o f HIV/AIDS. Without renewed efforts  to control the spread o f the disease, as many as 14 million people could be affected in the  region by the year 2000.

 M r Bilney said that tackling diseases such as malaria and HTV/AIDS would directly benefit  Australians as well as people in developing countries. The spread o f these diseases to  Australia would be slowed and Australian health-sector expertise would be show-cased in the  region. He was confident that the aid program's success in helping internationalise Australian 

 education, could be repeated in the medium term in the health-sector by expanding  international knowledge o f Australia's high value-added health exports.

 Mr Bilney said he was particularly pleased to announce these major health initiatives in the  International Year o f the Family.

 The aid budget also confirmed new funding for the $350 million, four-year development  cooperation program for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, announced by the Prime Minister, /  Paul Keating, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, during their recent visits to  those countries. This would substantially increase Australian assistance to these countries over  the next four years and reflects the dramatic transformations taking place in Indochina.

 Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were still amongst the world's poorest nations. Increased  Australian aid would be used to help overcome the appalling legacy o f anti-personnel mines;  improve people's health; and reconstruct inadequate, poorly maintained and war-damaged  infrastructure.

 Mr Bilney said the expanded development cooperation program in Indochina would further  strengthen Australia's impressive profile in the region and give us an ongoing role in its  dramatic transformation.

 Funding for environment activities would be increased to more than $120 million in 1994-95  to respond to the growing and urgent environment needs o f developing countries, especially in  Asia.

 Global environment issues such as climate change, ozone depletion and biodiversity would be  targeted. As part o f Australia's response to the United Nations Conference on Environment  and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Australia would provide new and additional  funding o f $5.7 million for the Global Environment Facility and the Montreal Protocol  Multilateral Fund. These measures would assist developing countries adopt ozone-friendly  technology and practices.

 A central part o f the new environment initiative would be the introduction o f an annual $20  million, Green Development Import Finance Facility (Green DIFF) initiative. Total funding for  DIFF programs in 1994-95 would be $130 million.

 M r Bilney said the Green DIFF initiative would allow the transfer o f environmentally-friendly  technology. It would help finance important environmental infrastructure, particularly in  water-supply and sanitation. It would also help confront the problems arising from rapid  industrialisation and urban growth.

 By demonstrating the environmental expertise and technology o f Australian firms, Green DIFF  would play a major role in enabling Australian companies to gain a share o f the rapidly  growing global environment infrastructure and services markets, estimated to grow to $300  billion by 2000. In so doing, it would generate up to $100 million per annum in export  revenue.

 countries in our region, commitments made under this program would be increased by $5  million in 1994-95.

 Mr Bilney said funding for Australian Non-Government Organisations would be increased to  about $100 million —  or seven per cent o f the total program, compared with tw o per cent ten  years ago.

 An additional $2.6 million would be provided for the volunteer agencies Australian Executive  Service Overseas Program and the Overseas Service Bureau. The Overseas Service Bureau  currently had over 400 Australians working abroad in more than 40 countries. AESOP and  OSB played an invaluable role in forging people to people links between Australia and  developing countries.

 A  greater emphasis would be placed on micro-enterprise development with new initiatives  taking total funding for MED in the Pacific and South-East Asia to $14 million over the next  two years. Micro-enterprises, including home-based and informal businesses, provided  employment and income for millions o f people, especially women. Encouraging the continued 

 development o f this dynamic sector had the potential to alleviate poverty in a very cost  effective way.

 Emergency and relief funding would be increased to more than $70 million —  the highest level  ever - in response to the growing need for emergency assistance demonstrated so graphically  by the flood o f refugees into neighbouring countries following the recent slaughter in Rwanda.

 Mr Bilney said funding for agricultural research through the Australian Centre for International  Agricultural Research would be increased by $2 million in real terms. Agricultural research  had direct benefits for Australia, as well as developing countries. As world food demand  could treble in 50 years, agricultural research and environmental management would remain  high priorities for the aid program.

 Assistance to Africa would be maintained in real terms with total funding o f $175 million,  about 12.5 per cent o f the total aid program. This included a new increased package o f  assistance to support the momentous changes underway in South Africa and meet the pressing 

 needs o f black South Africans.

 "This year's aid budget keeps pace with the fast growth in the Australian economy as a whole.  It makes a balanced attack on many development obstacles and will be welcomed by a wide  cross-section o f the Australian community," Mr Bilney said. -
