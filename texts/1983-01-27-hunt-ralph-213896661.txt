 AERIAL SURVEILLANCE FOR NORTHERN AUSTRALIA REORGANISED

 15/83

 The Minister fo r Transport and Construction, Mr Ralph Hunt, Government 

 spokesman on c iv il coastal surveillance, announced today that the 

 Commonwealth Government has decided to maintain surveillance of the 

 Great B arrier Reef but w ill discontinue specific surveillance of the 

 northern sea approaches used in the past by refugee boats.

 "The Government has decided daily aerial surveillance of the Great 

 Barrier Reef w ill continue to be undertaken u n til 31 March 1986 using 

 a Nomad Searchmaster L a irc ra ft" , Mr Hunt said.

 "This a irc ra ft is equipped with 360Â° search radar and advanced navigation 

 and communications equipment which has been found to be p a rtic u la rly  

 suitable fo r the task of ocean and reef surveillance. A dditionally, the 

 high d efin itio n  radar enhances the a irc ra ft's  capability in Search and 

 Rescue operations .

 "The decision reflects the Commonwealth Government's recognition of the 

 Great Barrier Reef as one of A ustralia's natural treasures", Mr Hunt said. 

 "The regular aerial surveillance flig h ts  w ill continue to protect the 

 reef from ille g a l a c tiv itie s  and marine pollution".

 Invitations to tender w ill be issued shortly fo r aerial surveillance  

 of the Great Barrier Reef from the end of March 1983.

 "The .decision to  cease a e ria l s u rv eilla n c e  o f the Darwin refugee boat 

 approaches follow ed a comprehensive review which showed th a t the  

 operation would no longer be cost e ffe c tiv e " , Mr Hunt said .

 "The Government noted th a t the in flu x  of refugees v ia  the north of 

 A u s tra lia  had a ll but ceased. There have only been two boat a r riv a ls  

 since December 1980, the la s t a r r iv a l being on 18 September 1981.

 Savings from discontinuance o f special coverage o f the Darwin approaches 

 w i l l  amount to  $5.4 m illio n  over the next three years.

 "Closer lia is o n  w ith South East Asian countries of f i r s t  refuge has 

 brought about o rd e rly  a r r iv a l o f Indo-Chinese refugees", Mr Hunt said .

 "We a n tic ip a te  p rio r warning of any major change to th is  s itu a tio n " .

 ."S u rv e illa n c e  o f the refugee approaches is , of course, only a small part  

 o f our d a ily  s u rv e illa n c e  e f f o r t  in the n o rth ", Mr Hunt continued.

 "The major ro le  o f l i t t o r a l ,  or c o a s tlin e , s u rv eilla n c e  fo r quarantine, 

 customs, p o llu tio n  m onitoring, search and rescue, ille g a l fis h in g  and other  

 purposes w i l l  be m aintained. In f a c t , contracts to  continue a e ria l  

 l i t t o r a l  s u rv e illa n c e  are to be c a lle d  e a rly  in February".

 Defence long range m aritim e a ir  p atro ls by RAAF P3 Orion a ir c r a f t  w ill  

 continue to give coverage to  offshore areas across the north and RAN 

 p a tro l boats w i ll continue to provide surface response, enforcement and 

 programmed p a tro ls .

 The M in is te r pointed out th a t a e ria l s u rv eilla n c e  of the refugee approaches 

 could be resumed q u ic kly  by using these other resources a v a ila b le  to the 

 A u s tra lia n  Coastal S u rveillan ce Organisation (COASTWATCH), including the 

 A u s tra lia n  Customs S ervice. A ir c r a ft soon to be on c h arter to COASTWATCH 

 fo r  d a ily  quarantine l i t t o r a l  s u rv e illa n c e  around the Northern T e rrito ry  

 would have improved navigation c a p a b ility  and would be able to conduct 

 o ffsh o re searches i f  re q u ired .

 "The Western A u stralian  and Northern T e r r ito r y  Governments have been 

 informed o f the Government's d e cisio n ," Mr Hunt said .
