 ANOTHER BOAT AS COALITION ‘TURN BACK’   POLICY CONTINUES TO UNRAVEL   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said another asylum seeker boat was intercepted today as the  Coalitionâs âturn back the boatsâ policy continued to unravel.   

 Todayâs boat arrival, carrying 34 asylum seekers, was the eleventh since Tony Abbott  rejected the Governmentâs offer to compromise and work together in the national interest to  implement offshore processing.    

 Mr Bowen said the latest boat came as the Coalition danced around the fading embers of  their tow-back policy, with Tony Abbott, Julie Bishop and Scott Morrison contradicting each  other at every turn.   

 “The Coalition have been all over the shop on tow-backs and remain in denial that this  policy could ever be implemented,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “Indonesia have repeatedly said they wonât have a bar of it, Navy and Border Protection  says it risks the lives of Australian defence personnel, and all the experts say itâs a dud.”   

 The revelation that Ms Bishop visited the Indonesia Ambassador and watered down Tony  Abbottâs promise to turn back all boats to Indonesia raises further questions.   

 “When Ms Bishop was telling the Indonesian Ambassador that Mr Abbottâs promise to turn  back all boats wasnât accurate, did she also ask the Indonesian Government to consider an  agreement with the Coalition on tow backs?” Mr Bowen said.   

 Mr Abbottâs turn back policy risks Australian lives and canât be implemented because  Indonesia doesnât support it.    

 There is a policy that is safe and will work - offshore processing in Malaysia. Unlike Mr  Abbottâs policy it does not risk Australian lives and has the support of the other country  involved.    

 Since Tony Abbott said ânoâ to the Governmentâs legislation in September last year, the  number of boats has more than doubled.    

 Mr Clare said the boats would keep coming as long as Tony Abbott said no.    

 “Letâs remember what this is all about - 200 people died when their boat sank just before  Christmas.   

 “Stopping this happening is within our grasp. Working together we can help stop people  dying at sea. We can pass legislation to introduce offshore processing.    

 “We both agree offshore processing is the way to stop this. We want to do it in Malaysia.  The Opposition want to do it in Nauru.    

 “We have agreed to do both.    

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he will stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
