 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 Boat K128: Illegal boats under Rudd triple 2001 arrivals 

 Wednesday 19th May 2010 

 K128 comes as illegal boats under Kevin Rudd are arriving almost three times the rate they 

 came in pre-Tampa 2001, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Shadow 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, 

 Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 

 “The arrival of boat K128 means 60 boats have now arrived so far this year with 2,961 

 people on board. At the same time in 2001 only 20 boats with 1,844 people on board arrived 

 illegally,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s failed immigration and border protection policies are now bringing illegal boats 

 in record numbers but unlike the Coalition, the Prime Minister is unwilling to take the action 

 necessary to fix this chaos,” he said. 

 

 “Instead Labor are asking churches to take asylum seekers as Christmas Island overflows 

 and on shore detention centres swell under the weight of Labor’s inept immigration and 

 border protection policies. 

 

 “First the Rudd Government described Christmas Island Detention Centre as a white 

 elephant, then it put up tents, then came the midnight flights to mainland detention centres, 

 quickly followed by motels and now churches which are being asked to take boat arrivals. 

 

 “Under Kevin Rudd, contingencies usually quickly become policies because of the rate of 

 arrivals. 

 

 “What’s next? Kevin Rudd commandeers your granny flat or spare room? The boats aren't 

 stopping, Kevin Rudd's policies are not going to stop the boats,” he said. 

 

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest arrival, the 60th this year, also marks the 60th policy failure of 

 the Rudd Labor Government on border protection in 2010. 

 

 “The Government is continuing to hide from its massive failure to secure Australia’s borders, 

 once again allowing the Customs and Border Protection Service to announce this boat 

 arrival. 

 

 “60 boats in under 5 months is just another in a long list of milestones this Government has 

 notched up since it weakened Australia’s borders in August 2008. 

 

 “There remains a large question mark over how many Customs and Border Protection 

 vessels remain available to intercept any new arrivals as more and more are required to taxi 

 people to Christmas Island - a round trip that can take six to eight days. 

 

 “The rate of arrivals is literally overwhelming the available capacity of our border protection 

 forces,” he said.
