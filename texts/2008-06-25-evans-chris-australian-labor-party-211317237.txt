 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 No plans to pay Centrelink benefits to illegal immigrants 

 Wednesday 25 June 2008 

 The Courier Mail today incorrectly reports that illegal immigrants will be paid the  dole. 

 There is no proposal before Government and no consideration being given to paying  Centrelink benefits to illegal immigrants. 

 Bridging visa holders are not currently eligible for Centrelink benefits and there is no  plan to change that. 

 The Rudd Government is aware of concerns in the community about the difficulties  faced by asylum seekers on bridging visas who are denied work rights or access to  Medicare while their claims are being processed. 

 It is vitally important that the bridging visa regime is not open to abuse. 

 For people who are found not to be refugees, a bridging visa enables a person to  remain lawful for the purpose of making arrangements to leave Australia or to seek  review through the courts. 

 As part of the overall reform process, the Rudd Government is intent on providing a  bridging visa framework that treats people fairly and with promptness.Â
