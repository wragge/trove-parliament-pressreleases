   THIRD NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON   HUMAN RIGHTS AND MENTAL HEALTH   

 Plenary Session Speech by   JULIA GILLARD MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH   

 9 September, 2005   

 Introduction   

 I am very pleased to be here with you today in the Australian Parliament.     

 It is timely indeed that you are here in this place, this week of all weeks.   

 In  this  week  we  saw  the  Howard  Government’s  lack  of  understanding  and  lack  of   compassion on mental health issues on clear display.   

 Any  government  that  genuinely  cared  about  mental  health  issues  would  not  let  the   Minister  for  Health,  Tony  Abbott,  continue  in  his  job  after  his  callous  and  ignorant   remarks following Mr John Brogden’s suicide attempt. 

 

 On  Monday  in  the  Parliament  I  said  that  Mr Abbott needed to do  the  honourable  thing   and resign as Minister for Health.   

 Today I will use the words of another to make the same point.  This week I received the  following email, which was sent to Tony Abbott, but copied to me:   

 As a parent who has recently lost a son in his prime of life to suicide caused by  depression I find your cheap remarks made last week about John Brogden to be  insulting  not  only  to  the  suffering  of  Mr  Brogden,  his  wife,  child,  parents  close   family  and  friends  but  to  all  people  suffering  depression,  suicidal  thoughts  and   those of us who have to live on and carry their grief  after losing their loved ones  so  needlessly  to  mental  illness.  You  won’t  find  us  coping  with  the  effects  or   aftermath of depression and suicide in the worst possible way to be making light  of Mr. Brogden's situation.   

 You  are  supposed  to  be  the  Health  Minister  and  have  proper  understanding  of   how  dangerous  depression  can  be  yet  you  have  shown  by  your  words  to  be   ignorant of the silent killer that haunts our society. You have more to do in your  role  than  balance  financials  in  the  Health  Industry,  you  should  be  setting  the  

 example  for  the  rest  of  Australia  to  follow  in  Mental  Health.  You  should  have  

 seized  on  the  opportunity  to  set  an  example  and  highlight  the  dangers  of   depression (as did Jeff Kennett) to make more Australians aware that someone in  their family could be suffering in silence and at risk, instead you coldly took an  opportunity to take a cheap shot at a person at risk and who so nearly lost his life.  By setting the correct example you could well have saved a life or more, instead 

 those suffering in silence are now less likely to talk about their problems for fear  of ridicule by the ignorant and insensitive like yourself.   

 I wonder if you would show the same lack of compassion and understanding if a  member  of  your  family  attempted  or  committed  suicide  -  of  course  not.  In  your   role  as  Health  Minister  you  should  go  out  and  speak  to  people  suffering  from   depression and those of us who try to live on and cope with our loss.   

 If  you  can't  show  understanding,  sensitivity  and  compassion,  get  the  hell  out  of   your role and give it to someone who can.   

 I trust those words will ring in Mr Abbott’s ears and cause him to think about both his  position as Health Minister and his attitude to mental illness.   

 Can I congratulate you for addressing in this conference issues that lie at the very heart of  the definition of a decent society and a true democracy.  If we fail to adequately address  human rights and mental health policy, then we fail as a society and as a democracy.   

 

 Do we now have an environment for mental health reform?   

 Slowly we are realising that mental health is not something separate from the health care  agenda, but an integral part of it.  It’s a part of good cancer care, of maternity care and of  youth  wellbeing.   It’s  a  part  of  addressing  the  social  justice  needs  of  Indigenous   Australians  and  it’s  a  part  of  our  responsibility  to  the  welfare  of  those  in  immigration   detention centres and prisons.   

 It can be argued that the Governments of Australia have been able to get away with the  lack  of  a  real  national  mental  health  strategy  and  the  resources  to  fund  it  because  the   community has allowed this to happen. 

 

 Yet there can hardly be a family in Australia that is untouched by mental illness.  People  with  mental  illness  and  their  families  and  carers  bear  substantial  social  and  economic   burdens.  The businesses and community structures of this nation also share some part of  this burden, but too often our attitude is that mental health problems are something that  happen to someone else.   

 Despite  the  widespread  prevalence  and  the  impact  of  mental  illness  on  the  community,   this has remained a largely hidden condition.     

 However  just  as  it  took  decades  to  realise  and  openly  acknowledge  that  cancer  was  a   burden all families bear, now at long last it seems that we have reached this point with  mental illness.   

 From  the  view  point  of  SAVE-Australia,  and  others  who  care  about  the  physical  and   mental  health  of  asylum  seekers,  refugees,  and  those  in  detention,  these  issues  are  now   playing  out  in  an  environment  that  is  much  more  understanding  and  much  more  

 concerned.   

 This new openness and recognition will really help in driving forward progress in mental  health and ensuring that mental health is part of the reform agenda we all want to see for  health care and for social justice. 

 

 This is in large part due to the ongoing lobbying and efforts of professional groups like  yours,  to  the  work  of  people  like  Jeff  Kennett  and  Bob  Carr,  to  the  willingness  of   recognised  community  figures  like  Alan  Fels  and  cricketer  Michael  Slater  to  speak  out   about their own experiences, and most recently, to the publicity surrounding the cases of 

 Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez Solon.     

 Something  about  the  Cornelia  Rau  case  grabbed  peoples’  attention  and  shook  their   complacency.  It made them realise that could have happened to them.   

 The  case  of  Vivian  Solon  highlights  the  complete  indifference  of  the  Howard   Government  and  particularly  the  Minister  for  Immigration  and  DIMIA,  to  the  plight  of   those unable to help themselves. 

 

 

 Labor’s approach to mental health policy   

 Labor  took  a  mental  health  policy  to  the  last  election  that  focused  on  four  major   priorities:   

 â¢ Making mental health a government priority, not hiding it away;  â¢ Early intervention to help people manage their mental health problems and be active  members of their family and community;  â¢ Community,  school  and  workplace  awareness  and  education,  to  take  away  stigma,  

 help with access to training and work, and assist with early diagnosis; and  â¢ Boosting the skills and resources of GPs, who are often the first health professionals  consulted by people with mental health problems.   

 This policy was launched by the Labor Leader, as a symbol of the very real importance  Labor  places  on  mental  health.   It  was  the  first  time  in  a  Federal  Election  campaign  a   policy on mental health had been given the same status as a Medicare policy or hospitals  policy or PBS policy.   

 Labor’s  policy  established  a  Prime  Minister’s  Council  on  Mental  Health  to  advise   Governments  (federal  and  state)  and  to  ensure  that  mental  health  has  the  recognition  it   needs.  The aim of the Council was to establish cross portfolio coordination so that issues  such  as  health  care,  housing,  disability  support,  employment  and  training  could  be   addressed. 

 

 With improved Commonwealth / State partnerships, all levels of Government would be  required to report annually on mental health expenditures, outcomes and progress against  agreed benchmarks. 

 

 

 

 Three  Reference  Groups  were  to  provide  advice  to  the  Prime  Minister’s  Council  on   Mental Health:  â¢ A  new  Administrative  Group,  with  an  independent  chair,  to  replace  the  current   National Mental Health Working Group;  â¢ A Carers Reference Group; and   â¢ A Client Reference Group.   

 The  major  national  community-based  groups  and  key  professional  organisations  would   be  represented  on  these  Reference  Groups,  as  well  as  people  with  mental  illness  and   those who care for them.   

 I believe such a model would have real benefits and would urge Prime Minister Howard  to disregard his Health Minister and to consider setting up such a Council.   

 The Senate Inquiry into Mental Health   

 Obviously  with  the  Howard  Government  returned,  Labor  has  had  to  find  ways  of   continuing to ensure mental health issues and reform is debated and moves forward.   

 Labor  sees  the  current  Senate  Inquiry  as  crucial  to  driving  forward  the  mental  health   reform agenda.  It is an opportunity which must not be wasted. Too many earlier reports  have failed to go beyond fine words and aspirations.  It is imperative that this inquiry is  able to produce an agenda for real action that will lead to the needed reforms.   

 The report from the Mental Health Council of Australia and the Human Rights and Equal  Opportunity  Commission  into  the  human  rights  of  people  with  a  mental  illness  and  the   progress made since the Burdekin Report in 1993 will also inform the work of the Senate  Inquiry.     

 

 So  we  are  understandably  concerned  about  reports  that  this  important  document  is   languishing  on  the  desk  of  either  the  Health  Minister  or  his  Parliamentary  Secretary  -   even they don’t seem exactly sure where it is and why.   

 What  is  certain  is  that  its  release  is  being  delayed  unnecessarily,  and  with  it  a  real   opportunity to review the issues of discrimination.     

 

 The action agenda   

 In the meantime, the action agenda must go forward. 

 1.  There  is  a  continuing  need  for  more  public  education  and  awareness  of  mental   illness   

 Research  shows  that  the  Australian  community  does  not  view  mental  health  as  a  major   general health issue.  Public awareness of common risk factors is limited.     

 Increased awareness will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and a grass roots push to  ensure  that  needed  services  are  available.   Most  importantly,  it  will  help  remove  the   current stigma that currently clouds attitudes - at all levels - to mental illness.     

 Addressing  discrimination  is  one  way  to  ensure  better  diagnosis,  treatment  and   rehabilitation.   

 2. Specific programs are needed to target youth at risk   

 Crucially mental health disorders cluster dramatically in young people when they usually  occur for the first time.  Mental health issues are responsible for 65-70% of the overall  burden of disease for young people between 15 and 24 years of age.    

 But less than a quarter of young people will get the help they need.  This results in a great  deal  of  unnecessary  suffering  for  young  people  and  their  families  and  widespread,   enduring, yet largely preventable social and economic damage.     

 Young people typically fail to access care, often having little idea of how to seek help,  and seeing doctors and therapists as authority figures unlikely to offer sympathetic help.     

 It  can  be  argued  that  young  people  are  poorly  served  by  the  health  care  system as  it  is   currently structured.  This is especially true for those with substance abuse problems and  with poor family and community support.     

 3. Mental health needs of the elderly and disabled are too often ignored   

 Too often the mental health status of the elderly is overlooked. Symptoms of depression,  confusion or agitation may be due to mental illness, Alzheimer’s Disease or inappropriate  medication.    

 There  is  a  large  population  of  older  people  with  significant  depressive  symptoms,  and   consequences of these symptoms include development of other illnesses, exacerbation of  co-existing  illnesses,  excess  use  of  health  services,  severe  restriction  of  quality  of  life,   and unnecessary suffering because of inadequate, wrong or no treatment.   

 4.  We  must  do  more  to  address  mental  health  issues  that  arise  because  of  physical   illnesses   

 There is a growing awareness of the need to address the psychosocial issues that confront  people diagnosed with cancer, or who have suffered other major health crises such as a  heart attack, a stroke or an organ transplant. 

 

 In 2003 the NH&MRC released its Clinical Practice Guidelines for the psychosocial care  of  adults  with  cancer  and  there  is  Level  1  evidence  for  many  of  the  interventions   proposed. 

 5. Failure to properly resource community care has lead to more mentally ill people in  prisons   

 Thousands  of  the  mentally  ill  are  warehoused  in  prison  for  various  alleged  and  proven   offences, at a huge cost to the system and to individual lives.   

 A 1996 study found that half the women and one-third of the men in prison in NSW said  they had been diagnosed with a mental illness at some time in their lives.  A more recent  study  found  that  74%  of  prisoners  suffered  from  a  psychiatric  disorder.   The  rate  of   psychosis is a startling 12% -- 30 times what it is in the general population. 

 

 Many mentally ill prisoners receive little or no treatment and with untrained and stressed  prison guards and thoughtless inmates, their lives begin to resemble those of the inmates  of the insane asylums of the 19th century.   

 So, as the MHCA said in its recent submission to the Senate the case than be made that  “while the [psychiatric] institutions themselves have closed, institutionalisation of people  with  a  mental  illness  has  in  fact  been  transferred  to  prisons  and  detention  systems  or   replaced with isolation within the community, for example through homelessness.”   

 6. People with chronic mental illness and their families and carers have huge unmet  needs   

 Over 90% of people with chronic mental illness now live outside hospital and residential  care, so services must increasingly adopt a community focussed approach.   

 Failure  to  provide  these  services  and  to  make  them  readily  accessible  means  that  those   with  a  chronic  or  recurrent  mental  illness  are  unable  to  lead  a  full  life  or  support   themselves.  Two thirds of all disability in people aged 15-30 is caused by mental illness.   

 And such failure also means that parents and families must shoulder enormous burdens  with little or no support to care for their mentally ill child or relative.     

 Too many people with chronic mental illness end up in our criminal system - or they end  up dead by accident or suicide.   

 7. We need to be better at providing culturally sensitive care   

 Mental health issues must be handled sensitively for all patients, but that is particularly  true for people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, and for refugees and  asylum seekers.   

 

 The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare admits that we have no real data about the  incidence or prevalence of mental disorders among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  people.     

 We do know that the rate of hospitalisation for Indigenous people diagnosed with mental  disorders  due  to  psycho-active  substance  use  is  4-5  times  that  for  the  non-Indigenous   population.  And we can imagine that traumas due to the lack of social justice, the impact  of  the  stolen  generations,  and  the  inequalities  in  services  also  have  an  impact  on  the   mental health of Indigenous communities. 

 

 8. We don’t have the mental health workforce that is needed to supply care   

 It would not be an exaggeration to say that we have a crisis situation, especially in rural  Australia.  

 Lack of access to training, professional isolation, heavy workloads and limited resources  affect the recruitment and retention of mental health personnel in rural and remote areas.   There is a shortage of mental health nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental  health professionals. 

 Only 7.5% of psychiatrists are located in rural or remote locations with more than 90% of  those  in  non-metropolitan  areas  being  in  major  regional  centres  like  Toowoomba.   Shortages  of  clinical  psychologists  are  also  evident  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  The   situation has been exacerbated by the rationalisation of public services in rural areas that  employed psychologists.  

 These  shortages  of  mental  health  professionals  undermine  the  development  of   intervention  and  prevention  strategies  for  people  at  risk.  As  a  consequence  of  the   shortages,  non-mental  health  professionals  in  rural  areas  are  more  likely  to  be  treating  

 people  with  a  mental  illness.  Options  for  referral  are  all  but  non-existent  in  many  rural   and remote areas  

 9. We must look at the current barriers to the provision of mental health services   

 Mental health services are currently provided in a relatively independent, non- cohesive  way due to:  The social-economic status of patient - this is often linked to the health insurance status  of the patient;  Geographic  factors  that  affect  the  availability  of  services,  especially  private  sector  

 services;  The fact that acute mental health services are funded primarily by state governments and  increasingly, private health insurers, and outpatient services are funded primarily by  the federal government under Medicare;  Other confounding factors such as alcohol and illegal drug use and the level of functional 

 disability of the patient; and   The individual attitudes of health providers, carers and patients themselves.   

 Conclusion   

 This should be a time for reform in the health care system, and particularly in the mental  health system.     

 In the absence of demonstrated leadership from the Howard Government, it will be left to  the  Opposition,  the  States  and  Territories,  the  health  care  professionals,  community   groups  and  the  patients  to  force  the  needed  action  agenda  and  change.   We  need  a   strategic  approach  and  a  substantial  long-term  investment,  with  the  primary  focus  on   patient benefits and outcomes.  And we must protect the human rights that are too readily  lost to those who must deal with mental illness.   

 Labor intends to be a leader in health care reform and to address the issues with strategic  policies  developed  on  a  consultative  basis  and  fully  costed.   Labor  will  not  shirk  the   difficult decisions in this regard.   

 We look forward to working with you on these issues.
