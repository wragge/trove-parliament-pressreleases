 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Detainees returned to Indonesia 

 Sunday, 16 December 2007 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today  confirmed a group of 16 Indonesians detained on Christmas Island has been  returned to Indonesia. 

 'Returning these people to Indonesia is in line with the Australian  Government’s firm but fair approach to the orderly migration of people to  Australia,' Senator Evans said. 

 A charter aircraft transferred the group with government escorts, landing in  Jakarta early yesterday evening. 

 'This group did not engage Australia’s protection obligations under the  Refugees Convention,' the minister said. 

 'People from other countries do not have a right to stay here just on the basis  they would be economically better off.'  

 The minister said the International Organization for Migration would be  responsible for the group’s resettlement in Indonesia. 

 The Royal Australian Navy rescued the three families, from Roti, from a  wooden boat 650km west of Darwin on November 20.  

 They were transferred to Christmas Island on November 25 for assessment  and were subsequently detained in the community after health checks and  Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) interviews were  completed. 

 DIAC worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the  Indonesian Government to arrange the group’s return. 

 'The Australian Government provided support for the group to reach their final  destination,' Senator Evans said. 

 'I would like to extend a thank you to the Indonesian Government for its  continued cooperation on immigration issues,' the minister added.
