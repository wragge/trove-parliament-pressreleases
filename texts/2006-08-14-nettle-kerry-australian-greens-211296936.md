 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Time to end the Pacific Solution 

 

 Senator Nettle, 14th August 2006   

 Greens Immigration Spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the Prime  Minister to scrap 'Pacific Solution' following his withdrawal the latest bill to send  asylum seekers to Nauru.    

 "The Australian public and the parliament have indicated that they do not want  asylum seekers sent to Nauru. It is now tone for the government to shut down the  camp and end the 'Pacific Solution', Senator Nettle said.    

 "The Nauru experiment has been shown to be a failure it has ruined and damaged  lives and seen asylum seekers returned to face persecution and death in their home  countries.    

 "Despite this bill being withdrawn the government still intends to send to asylum  seekers to Nauru.    

 "The majority of the Australian community has realised that the government's fear  campaign against asylum seekers is baseless and they do not support the cruel pacific  solution and mandatory detention regime.    

 "The next migration bill should be one to dismantle the Pacific Solution.    

 "The Greens support a humane compassionate refugee processing system which  would allow asylum seekers to be processed whilst living in the Australian  community."
