 Michael Keenan 

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 PRIME MINISTER CLAIMS NEW TITLE  - KEVIN 107  

 Saturday, 10 April 2010   

 Only hours after the Government’s announcement of a bandaid solution to the  growing swell in boat arrivals yesterday, another vessel was intercepted in  Australian Waters, making it the 107th unauthorised arrival since Kevin Rudd  weakened Australia’s border protection in August 2008.    

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said  this latest arrival, and with it a massive policy failure by the Government,  inspired a new election slogan for Labor to take to the polls - Kevin 107.    

 “Kevin Rudd rode the success of his Kevin 07 campaign at the last election -  perhaps Kevin 107 will prove equally as catchy,” said Mr Keenan.    

 “At least under the banner Kevin 107, the Government can be honest with the  Australian people about their failure to secure Australia’s borders.    

 Boat ‘Kevin 107’ was intercepted yesterday evening North East of West Island,  carrying 10 passengers.    

 Shadow Minister for Immigration Scott Morrison said Kevin Rudd’s tough talk  had been exposed for the lack of any real action with the arrival of boat Kevin  107.    

 “The arrival of boat Kevin 107 is the people smugglers verdict on Kevin Rudd’s  political fix announced yesterday rather than a genuine plan to stop the boats.    

 “This will be one of many more boats to follow which will cause the Australian  government to simply pay the rent longer to avoid this issue with any serious  policies.
