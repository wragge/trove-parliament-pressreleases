 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/858 SUNDAY 5 SEPTEMBER 2004    SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS  Democrats Moreton Bay candidate to put the blowtorch to Multiculturalism Minister  Launching Moreton Bay candidate, Ms Freddie Steen, today Australian Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said she was a strong community activist who had worked hard on refugee and migrant issues.  "Freddie Steen will put the blowtorch to Gary Hardgrave. The Minister cannot just keep giving bland assurances while his partyâ€™s policies undermine our multicultural society."  Ms Freddie Steen said that local member Gary Hardgrave, the Minister for Multiculturalism and Citizenship and his party, had divided the community on social justice issues, and alienated sections of society. "In an electorate which has the highest percentage of Brisbane households where English is not the main language spoken, it is important that we have a vision of an inclusive Australia," Ms Steen said. Freddie Steen is a former teacher and public servant with a strong commitment to representing all the voters in the electorate of Moreton.
