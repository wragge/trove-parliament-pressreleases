 Senator Kerry Nettle 

 Senator for New South Wales   

 West Papuans deserve respect not detention  Senator Nettle, 18th January 2006  Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today welcomed the news that the West Papuan  asylum seekers boat has been found and called on the Government to grant these asylum  seekers bridging visas instead of throwing them in detention for months, years or  indefinitely.    

 "Australia must do the right thing by assessing these people's claims in Australia. It  would be a cruel tragedy to now send these people to Nauru or some other island prison,"  Senator Nettle said.    

 "They should be treated in a similar way to the East Timorese who came here, by being  given bridging visas with full rights and allowed to live in the community while their  claims are assessed.    

 "We have recently seen an increase in hostility towards members of the West Papuan  independence movement by the Indonesia with arrests and reports of increased human  rights abuses. It is important that these activists are not returned to such danger. Nor  should they be hidden away in one of Australia's offshore detention centres.    

 "Everyone knows detention ruins lives so the Government has a choice to avert further  human tragedy by allowing these West Papuans to live in the community.    

 "It will be simpler and more humane to grant these people bridging visas until their  asylum claims are assessed.    

 "No-one should be incarcerated in Australia's gulags because everyone knows they ruin  lives," Senator Nettle said.
