  TRIBUNALS REPORT CALLS FOR CHANGE 

  . . 

  A report calling for a major overhaul of Australia's tribunal system  was launched today by the Justice Minister, Duncan Kerr. 

  Tribunals are a central and crucial feature of Australia's . justice  system and administrative decisions affect thousands of Australians  everyday. 

  "Better Decisions", a 220 page report by the Administrative Review  Council, calls for changesâ‘ to key tribunals including â‘ the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Social Security Appeals Tribunal,â‘  the Veterans Affairs Tribunal, the Immigrationâ‘ Review Tribunal  and the Refugee Review Tribunal. 

  Chapters 1-7 of the report deals with ways the tribunal system  could be improved without changing the structure. Suggested  reforms cover training of tribunal . members, tribunal membership  and . appointments to tribunals, alternative dispute resolution,  interpreters, review of decisions and tribunal funding. 

  Chapter 8 suggests the Government consider amalgamating five key  tribunals into a new tribunal to be called the Administrative  Review Tribunal. The ART would then be divided into seven  divisions. 

  Launching the report, Mr Kerr thanked the ARC for its work and  said: "Affordable, faster and more accessible justice is the theme of  the Government's legal reform. 

  "We are going to consult widely for six months about the  recommendations in this report before we decide how extensive the  reforms to the tribunal system should be."
