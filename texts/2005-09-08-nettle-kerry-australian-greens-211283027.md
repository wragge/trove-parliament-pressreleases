 GSL prison approach puts asylum seekers to  work 

 8th September  2005 

 Senator Kerry Nettle today identified the prison culture, which is part of the  policy of mandatory detention, as responsible for the possible illegal and  certainly exploitative use of detainees as cheap labour.   

 "The Palmer report identified the use of staff and management from a  'corrections' background as 'inappropriate', and the use of detainees as  cheap labour maybe a result of this inappropriate staffing," Senator Nettle  said.   

 "Asylum seekers are not convicted criminals and cannot be legally used as  cheap labour, but GSL who manage detention centres are doing just that  and the Minister is ultimately responsible.   

 "The Minister is responsible for presiding over a system which treats asylum  seekers as prisoners, employs ex-prison guards and prison managers who  use prison techniques unsuitable for dealing with families in administrative  detention.   

 "Cultural change at the Department of Immigration must start with the  scrapping of mandatory detention and an end to the employment of prison  guards to manage the care of asylum seekers and refugees.   

 "The Minister should pick up on the concern of Mick Palmer, end the  exploitation of asylum seekers in immigration detention and create a care  culture in the department not a prison culture."
