  MEDIA RELEASE  SENATOR NICK MINCHIN  Minister for Finance and Administration

  AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

  NOVEMBER 2005 

  KEY POINTS  0 The underlying cash balance for the 2005-06 year to 30 November 2005 was a surplus of  $3,165 million.  The fiscal balance for the 2005-06 year to 30 November 2005 was a surplus of $9,946 million. 

  The operating result for the 2005-06 year to 30 November 2005 was a surplus of $10,187 million.  The difference between the fiscal and underlying cash balances is largely attributable to increases in  taxation and other receivables and a reduction in education grants payable.  0

  Operating Result 

  * As published in the 2005-06 MYEFO. 

  Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years and to full year estimates.  Revenues and expenses do vary from month-to-month. Factors such as The New Tax System, and the accrual  framework including the timing of payments and policy decisions, can have a large impact on fiscal  aggregates from one year to the next and on year-to-date outcomes. Further, the November 2005 monthly  financial statements were produced under the Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting  Standards (AEIFRS), with the exception that the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel  Organisation are not yet reporting AEIFRS compliant data for monthly reporting purposes. The move to  AEIFRS brings a number of changes including a new financial statement, the ‘Statement of Changes in  Equity’.

  FISCAL, OUTCOMES 

  Underlying Cash Balance  The main components of the underlying cash balance are cash from operations and cash movements in the  net investment in non-financial assets. 

  The underlying cash balance for the year to 30 November 2005 was a surplus of $3,165 million. This  underlying cash balance is $1,607 million lower than the November pro-rata (a surplus of $4,772 million) of  the 2005-06 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) estimate of $1 1,452 million, but is  consistent with prior year November balances. The difference reflects a number of individual variations  including the following: 

  Movements in underlying cash receipts: 

  Lower receipts from: 

  0 Taxation in line with the usual monthly fluctuations in taxation receipts. 

  Higher receipts from: 

  Dividends due to the receipt of the RBA dividend in August each year. 

  Movements in underlying cash payments: 

  Lower payments for: 

  Grants due to: 

  - the AusLink and Natural Disaster Relief hangements programmes. The level of these payments  does not occur equally each month but when State and/or Local Governments make claims for  payment; 

  - the delay in commencement of payments to the States under the National Competition Policy and  Compensation for GST Revenue Foregone programmes; 

  - underspends in programmes including Drug Strategy, Immunisation, ATSI Services, Medical Indemnity, Mental Health and Primary Care Financing; and  - the National Water Commission’s negotiations with funding recipients over the detailed provisions  of the funding agreements have not yet been finalised, although substantial progress has been made. 

  0 Personal Benefits due to: 

  - lower than expected numbers of people receiving Disability Support Pension.  Foreign aid, specifically, AusAID’s three country and regional programmes (PNG & Pacific; East Asia;  and South Asia, Africa and Other) as well as the Emergency, Humanitarian and Refugee Aid and NGO,  Volunteer and Community programmes. These payments are not incurred on a pro rata basis, due to the  timing of activities, requirements of partner Governments and organisations, and the unpredictable  nature of expenditure on emergencies: 

  Higher payments for: 

  Grants due to the irregularity of payments for schools and higher education.

  Fiscal Balance  The fiscal balance for the year to 30 November 2005 was a surplus of $9,946 million. The main  components of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating balance, which was a surplus of $10,172 million,  and a net capital investment of $226 million for the year to 30 November 2005 (refer to the Reconciliation  of the Operating Result to Fiscal Balance on page 9 for fiuther detail). 

  FINANCIAL OUTCOMES  Actual expenses are $8,174 million lower when compared with a pro-rata of the MYEFO estimate. The  main reasons for the lower result, provided by function, are due to: 

  Education function - Lower expenses for education grants. In accordance with the legislation, a large  proportion of education grants are expensed between December and February of each year to suit the  calendar year operations of these institutions. 

  Transport Function - Lower expenses mainly attributable to AusLink and other transport programmes as  the level of these expenses does not occur equally each month but when State and/or Local  Governments make claims for payment. 

  Defence Function - lower supplier expenses as traditionally a higher proportion of the suppliers budget  is used in the second six months of the financial year, reflecting lead times associated with procurement. 

  Partially offset by: 

  Social Security and Welfare Function - Higher expenses as the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Supplement  is paid upon lodgement of a recipient’s tax return. Because tax returns are mostly lodged in the period  from July to October in each year, a hgher proportion of expenses from the FTB supplement falls in  these months. 

  Assets and Liabilities  The net asset balance within the General Government sector is a negative net asset position of  $29,066 million at 30 November 2005.

  NOTES:  The accounting policies in this part are generally consistent with the requirements of AEIFRS. While the  scope for financial reporting recommended in AAS 31 is the whole of government (that is, the Australian  Government public sector), in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, this presentation 

  covers the general government sector only. This publication does not include full note disclosures. 

  With the introduction of Business Activity Statements and Instalment Activity Statements in 2000-2001,  taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several types of tax when lodging the statement  and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with certainty at the  end of each month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all  statements are received and processed. The outcomes for some revenue items provided in this statement are  thus estimates, in accordance with the best judgement of the Taxation Commissioner, and subject to  revision. The taxation revenue items not affected are: Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, Excise duty, Customs 

  duty, Other Taxes and Individuals Refunds. 

  The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported  in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses. 

  All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AEIFRS basis, unless otherwise indicated.

  NOTE 3: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX  In regard to GST revenue, A A S  would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the Australian  Government's Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of the Intergovernmental Agreement  on the Reform of Australian Government-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a State tax collected  by the Australian Government in an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated  payments to the States and Territories are not disclosed in these statements. 

  GST Revenue (a)  (collected on behalf of the States) 

  * As published in the 2005-06 MYEFO.  (a) GST revenue is presented in this note on an accrual basis. This  which payments to the States and Temtories are based.  differs from GST cash receipts, on 

  NOTE 4: ADJUSTMENT FOR EDUCATION GRANT EXPENDITURE  In regard to education grant expenditure, adherence to AAS results in few education expenses being  reported until the signing of the Ministerial determination, which normally occurs between December and  February each year. This produces a bunching of expenses such that the full year's expense is recognised at  that time and remains relatively constant until June. The table below provides details of the cash paid by  DEST and attributable to the Education h c t i o n  for the year to date.
