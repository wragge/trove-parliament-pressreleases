 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats   Immigration Spokesperson 

 25 February 2004          MEDIA RELEASE                04/103               

 

 Tampa people recognised as refugees  - 30 months on, Govt still dodges responsibility -   

 The Australian Democrats say the Federal Government has an overwhelming responsibility to resettle  refugees from the Tampa who are still detained on Nauru, 30 months after they were first prevented  from seeking protection in Australia.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the news that another 9 people rescued by the Tampa  have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) put  the onus on the Immigration Minister to act immediately to free these people from detention on Nauru. 

 

 “Reports that the Immigration Minister ‘may or may not’ allow resettlement of Tampa refugees in  Australia is another example of the Government continuing to deny its responsibility for the suffering  and plight which these people have endured,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The only reason these refugees have spent 30 months in detention instead of being well on the way to  rebuilding their lives is that the Federal Government is using them as political pawns.”   

 There are 22 asylum seekers remaining on Nauru who were rescued by the Tampa. Of these, nine have  been assessed by the UNHCR to be refugees, with the eligibility of the other 13 still being examined.   

 Senator Bartlett, who met with the Tampa refugees on Nauru last month, said the suffering endured by  these people was enormous.   

 “These are refugees who fled the Taliban, came within a few hours of drowning at sea, followed by  weeks crowded on board a container ship and Navy vessels, only to be dumped on Nauru and left to rot  by Australia.   

 “The Government must no longer ignore the enormous human and financial cost. For 30 months the  Government has bent the truth and pretended this situation has nothing to do with Australia.   

 “This farce of imprisoning refugees in isolation on Nauru has to end.  The Democrats repeat our call for  the Minister to visit the camps and detainees.  Hundreds of millions of Australian dollars have  disappeared into this facility with little result other than a massive amount of unnecessary human  suffering,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
