 DEMOCRATS CALL FOR FULL REVIEW OF REFUGEE TRIBUNAL FOLLOWING HIGH COURT DECISION

 A unanimous High Court decision today that found the decisions by the Refugee Review Tribunal were invalid and had failed to follow procedural fairness could have major ramifications, according to the Australian Democrats.

 Democrats' Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the decision exposes major problems with the way the Refugee Review Tribunal reaches its decisions and demonstrates why the Coalition Government has been so desperate to try to prevent judicial review of refugee decisions.

 “A second decision of the High Court on a similar case came to the same conclusions by a 5-2 majority,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Whilst these findings apply initially to only two cases, my understanding is that the proceedings were representative ones which potentially affect class actions involving over 7000 people.

 “Such a conclusive finding by a conservatively dominated High Court clearly demonstrates how much Minister Ruddock has allowed our refugee determination processes to deteriorate.

 “Today’s High Court decision must lead to a comprehensive review of the procedures used by the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 “It should not be forgotten that this Tribunal literally makes life and death decisions.  For it to reach those decisions using processes that have been found to be seriously flawed must not be tolerated, particularly when we have a Government doing all it can to prevent any form of review of those decisions.

 “Unless the Minister objects to the precedents in these cases applying to those people who are signed up to the class actions, it could lead to thousands of cases all being sent back to the Tribunal for re-determination.  If the Minister does object it could mean all of those cases having to be individually assessed for procedural fairness by the courts.

 “Either way, this finding could be a landmark judgment which should lead to a major re-assessment of the adequacy of our refugee determination process,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
