 Continental drift: whatever happened to Australia’s trade policy?

 Address to the Centre for Public Policy, University of Melbourne

 When I was given the task of explaining whatever happened to Australia’s trade policy I must admit I thought the question implied that Australia no longer had a trade policy; that maybe it had drifted off into the mid-Pacific.

 And yet I had admired Tim Fischer as Trade Minister for the way he had stood up to Hansonism, a reincarnation of the nationalistic, protectionist policies championed so effectively by Black Jack McEwen.

 When Pauline Hanson replied to a question about xenophobia with her famous, politically winning “Please explain,” Tim Fischer could have packed it in, jumped on Hanson’s bandwagon and manned the barricades against cheap imports from nasty Third-World countries.

 That Tim Fischer instead circled the wagons and repelled the early attacks of the Hansonist forces is a tribute to him.

 But this may have been the greatest achievement of the Howard Government’s trade policy.

 The present Coalition leadership seems bewildered in dealing with the anti-globalisation forces - a bit like General Custer’s last words at the Battle of Little Big Horn: “I don’t get it, a minute ago these Indians were singing and dancing!”

 But such a benign interpretation of the Howard Government's approach to trade policy might be too generous.

 2

 The Government’s appeal to nationalism - "we will never surrender our sovereignty to the UN, the ILO or any other global organisation" - has served the Howard Government's political interests very well.

 It has extended to controversies over asylum seekers and the Government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change (while agreeing to meet its targets).

 Whether the Howard Government's aggressive bilateralism on trade policy has served the national interest is far more debatable.  I argue that it has not.

 Readers influenced by the excellent book by this evening’s convenor, Dr Ann Capling, Australia and the Global Trade System, are likely to come to the same conclusion.

 Australia had a clearly defined trade policy for most of the 20th Century, sometimes good for Australia, but more often not.

 For four-fifths of the 20th Century the deal was protection all round.  This approach was forged out of battles at Federation between the free traders and the protectionists. It then became the beggar-thy-neighbour policies of the early 1930s, continued through the erection of trade barriers by successive Coalition Governments in the 1950s and 1960s, was interrupted by the tariff cuts of the Whitlam Government, and was then followed by the reversion to protection of the Fraser years.

 It would not be biased to observe that Labor governments, while being responsible for some of the protectionism, have achieved most, if not all, of the trade liberalisation that has occurred in Australia since Federation.

 The Chifley Government was an active participant among just 23 countries in establishing post-War global trading rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Australia’s activism being led by eminent economists Sir John Crawford and Nugget Coombs.

 But Australia had to wait for more than two decades (and many tariff increases) for further trade liberalisation, until the Whitlam Government’s 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cuts of 1973.

 This was not done as an isolated policy.

 The Whitlam Government transformed the Tariff Board into the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and gave it the job of reviewing all domestic protection.

 But in the finest traditions of protectionism the Fraser Coalition Government increased tariffs on Australia’s most heavily protected industries and introduced quotas on top of tariffs.

 Predictably, the escalating manufacturing protection of the Fraser years failed to protect manufacturing jobs.

 Trade liberalisation began in earnest upon the election of the Hawke Labor Government in 1983.

 The Hawke Government implemented protection-reducing plans for the TCF and automotive industries and announced general tariff cuts in 1988 and 1991.

 The Labor Government’s trade policy was supported by three pillars: â¢ unilateral reductions in domestic protection to secure national gains from better resource allocation; â¢ priority for multilateral negotiations as a means of securing better market

 access abroad; and â¢ a non-discriminatory basis for the pursuit of bilateral and regional trade liberalisation.

 Combined with an economic reform program of floating the dollar, financial market deregulation and competition-enhancing policies, Labor’s trade policies have been associated with the fastest growth in productivity and in per capita incomes in the nation’s history.

 Since the election of the Howard Government all three pillars of Labor’s trade policy have been neglected or actively dismantled.

 It is hard to think of any major Howard Government successes in gaining better market access for Australian exports.

 The Government’s 2001 election policy cites chilled pork to Singapore, sheep to Saudi Arabia and mangoes and rice to Japan.

 The Government counts among its greatest successes the limiting of restrictions on our exports of lamb to the United States.

 Judging by the number of media releases and parliamentary statements, the Government claims as its finest moment in international trade diplomacy its achievement of limiting to 15 per cent the proportion of Australia’s steel exports to the US affected by new trade restrictions.

 Conveniently, the Government chooses to measure its success by volume of steel exports affected; in truth 30 per cent of the value of Australia’s steel exports to the US remain affected by new import barriers.

 In its 2001 election statements the Howard Government claim credit for a 54 per cent increase in exports since coming to office, a trade surplus of $707 million and seven consecutive monthly trade surpluses.

 But it has not claimed responsibility for the most recent trade deficit of  $643 million, the ninth monthly deficit in succession.

 It is true that exports have grown strongly since 1996.

 This performance is overwhelmingly the product of good seasonal and market conditions for primary commodity exports, a very low exchange rate and improved market access obtained in the years preceding 1996 (beef to Japan and Korea and wool to China being prime examples).

 Growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactured goods has actually slowed since 1996, from 17 per cent per annum in the last five years of the previous Government to less than 8 per cent per annum under the present Government.

 The Government has set itself a goal of doubling the number of exporters by 2006.

 But it has no strategy or additional resources to achieve this goal and has capped the Export Market Development Grant Scheme at $150 million - effectively limiting the assistance to new exporters.

 Perhaps if the Government had no trade policy at all and just let our exports continue ticking over, less damage would be inflicted on Australia’s future trade prospects.

 But the Government’s flirtation with a preferential bilateral trade agreement with the United States threatens heavy damage on future access to the markets of East Asia.

 As Trade Minister Mark Vaile pointed out to this very forum in July, average tariffs in the APEC countries have declined from 12 per cent to eight per cent in the last five years and more than two-thirds of APEC country imports attract tariffs of five per cent or less.

 Why threaten this greatly improved access for Australian exports?

 The Government’s enthusiastic pursuit of a preferential FTA with the United States, in the same time frame as the Doha Round, is diverting attention away from our major trading partners in East Asia.

 The Howard Government continually reassures Australian farmers that the Americans have put agriculture on the negotiating table in the proposed preferential FTA with Australia.

 Why the Australian Government would believe the US Administration would settle a discriminatory FTA that included agriculture, outside of the Doha Round, is beyond comprehension.

 Wouldn’t the Americans save any concessions on agriculture for the Doha Round in order to extract similar concessions from the EU and Japan?

 The Howard Government thinks not; because of its claimed close strategic relationship with America the Government will be offered a special agricultural deal for Australia that does not extend to Europe and Japan.

 In fact, the Government’s arguments as to why we need an FTA with the US now, have very little to do with sound trade objectives and more to do with a 1950s view of alliance management.

 5

 Far from deepening Australia’s relationship with the United States, the pursuit of a preferential FTA can only damage the relationship.

 When the Americans, inevitably, indicate that agricultural products such as sugar and dairy are off the table in a US-Australia FTA, Australians will be very unhappy.

 Australian sugar and dairy farmers will say they have been betrayed, especially since Mr Vaile indicated a few days ago that as far as the Howard Government was concerned “everything was on the table”, including Australia’s quarantine laws and single marketing desks.

 The Howard Government’s flirtation with a discriminatory trade agreement with the US runs the very real risk of encouraging East Asian countries to conclude their own agreements that discriminate against Australia.

 Economic analysis of the impact of a US-Australia trade agreement commissioned by the Government (and cited repeatedly by senior Ministers) shows that a preferential US-Australia FTA would divert Australian imports from East Asia to the United States.

 In particular, the modelling shows that automotive imports would be diverted from Japan and Korea to the US, while TCF imports would be diverted from China to the US (in reality, to Mexico as Mexican TCF imports enter the US under NAFTA).

 The Government says the countries of East Asia have expressed no concerns about the prospect of Australia negotiating such a preferential FTA with the US.

 But why encourage China, the ASEAN countries and Japan to establish exclusive trading blocs at Australia’s expense?

 Why deliberately put at risk the more than 55 per cent of Australia’s exports that are sold in East Asia for a modest improvement in the 10 per cent of our exports that go to the United States?

 That is why Labor says put Doha first.

 It is time for the Government of Australia to resume the leadership role it played, as chair of the Cairns Group of fair trading nations, in multilateral trade negotiations.

 As trade adviser on the staff of Prime Minister Bob Hawke, I attended the meeting in Cairns that established this influential third force in multilateral trade negotiations.

 The Australian Labor Government displayed true leadership in the Uruguay Round.

 I hope the Howard Government does not decline the challenge of renewed leadership, in the Doha Round, through its chairmanship of the Cairns Group, for the base political purposes of emphasising its hostility to global institutions.

 Lest this suggestion be seen to be too harsh, the Howard Government can demonstrate its bona fides by giving two commitments to the Australian public.

 The first is that any free trade agreement with the United States must remove US trade barriers for all Australian agricultural exports.

 The second is that a US-Australia FTA will not discriminate against Australian trade with East Asia.

 If the Howard Government is fair dinkum about its preference for multilateral trade negotiations and for an open trading system it will have no difficulty in giving those commitments.

 Having given them, it can look forward to the support of Labor for stronger economic and investment relationships with the United States, an economic cooperation agreement that promotes US-Australian trade and investment while not discriminating against our other trading partners.
