 1990-91 IMMIGRATION PROGRAM

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs,  Mr Gerry Hand, announced today that Australia would  select up to 126 000 new settlers during 1990-91.

 Mr Hand said the planning levels would be 64 000 for family  migration, 50 000 for,skill migration, 11 000 (including a  contingency reserve of 1000 places) for humanitarian  migration, and a small special eligibility category of 1000  places.

 The Minister said the program would maintain the current  balance between the family and skill migration program  components.

 "The Government has decided on a balanced reduction from the  1989-90 announced program planning level of 140 000 places,"  Mr Hand said.

 "The new figure of 64 000 for family migration is based on  trends emerging in the level of demand from concessional  family applicants who are of acceptable skill and age  levels. It's expected that suitable applicants will fill 

 20 000 places in the concessional family category in the  coming year.

 "The planning level of 50 000 for skill migration has been  set in anticipation of a slightly lower demand for skilled  labour in 1990-91. It's anticipated that there will be fewer  employer nominations and some drop-off in the points-tested 

 independent category." __ _

 Mr Hand said that, despite the special arrangements made to  provide long-term protection for a large number of nationals  from the People's Republic of China, a significant off-shore  humanitarian component remained in place to maintain  Australia's capacity to respond to refugee resettlement 

 needs and commitments.

 In particular, Australia's commitment regarding the  resettlement of Indo-Chinese refugees remains strong.  Australia has responded to humanitarian situations in all  parts of the world, and is one of the most prominent 

 resettlement nations.

 â¢  Mr Hand said the Immigration Outlook Conference,  being held  by the Bureau of Immigration Research in Melbourne in  November this year, would provide a forum for bringing  together views on migration, and would create a solid 

 foundation for the Government to review program directions  for 1991-92 and beyond.
