 Australian assistance for Horn of Africa Australia will provide assistance for Somali and Ethiopian refugees living in Kenya, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 Assistance will also be given to about 300,000 people suffering drought related crop losses in northeastern Kenya.

 "Kenya has become a major country of refuge," Mr Kerin said, "with 2000-3000 refugees from Somalia and Ethiopia crossing the border daily.

 "Australia will provide $250,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to assist the refugees, who are living in camps in remote areas.

 "The refugees have few prospects of farming in these semi arid areas. There are shortages of water and medicine and death rates in one camp have reached 35 people per day.

 "A further $200,000 will be provided to World Vision Australia to assist drought affected people in the Wajir and Mandera districts of northeastern Kenya.

 "World Vision will provide supplementary food for 25,000 people including those in high risk categories such as very small children and the elderly.
