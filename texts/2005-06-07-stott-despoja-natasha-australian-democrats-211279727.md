 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/302 TUESDAY 7 JUNE 2005   SENATOR NATASHA STOTT DESPOJA AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS  DOWNER MUST INTERVENE TO PROTECT CHINESE DIPLOMAT The Australian Democrats have called on Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, to intervene in the case of Chinese consular officer, Chen Yonglin, who is seeking asylum in Australia after speaking out against the Chinese Government. Democrats' Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said there was an urgent need to ensure Mr Chen’s safety. “There are overwhelming humanitarian, political and public interest reasons to grant asylum to Mr Chen,” Senator Stott Despoja said. “The safety of Mr Chen and his family must be the first priority, but there are a whole range of other reasons why this case is important.   “If Mr Chen’s allegations are true, they have implications for Australia’s relationship with China. “Especially at this pivotal time when we are in preliminary negotiations for a free trade agreement, I think many Australians would have serious concerns about allegations that China has kidnapped people within our own borders. “Because of the complex issues surrounding this case and the urgent need to protect Mr Chen and his family, the Foreign Minister must intervene. “The Minister must not deflect responsibility by hiding behind Australia’s deeply flawed immigration processes.   “The potential to grant Mr Chen territorial asylum provides a mechanism for Mr Downer’s direct intervention in this case and he should utilise that mechanism. Senator Stott Despoja also encouraged the Government to take up Mr Chen’s offer to provide information regarding the Chinese Government’s alleged illegal activities within Australia.  “If this kind of activity is taking place within our borders, the Government has a responsibility to investigate it. It would be negligent if the Government failed to pursue these allegations further with Mr Chen,” Senator Stott Despoja said.    Media Contact - Raina Hunter - 0417 085 260
