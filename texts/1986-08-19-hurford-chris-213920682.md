 M INISTER FOR IM M IG R A T IO N  A N D  ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 The Hon. CHRIS HURFORD, M .P.  i

 MPS84/86

 FEES FOR IMMIGRATION SERVICES

 Fees for some services provided by the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are to be increased.

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Chris  Hurford, said tonight the increases accorded with the  user-pays principle, adopted by successive Governments,   which sought to ensure that recipients pay for services,   wherever practicable, rather than taxpayers as a whole.

 The increase also reflected the Budgetary pressures facing  the Government and the need to avoid these being borne by  reductions in services to clients.

 In all cases, Mr Hurford said, the increases had been kept  to a minimum. None of the services was being fully cost-  recovered. .

 Charges for some other Departmental services had not been  increased.

 The new fees are:

 Mr Hurford also announced the introduction of a fee of $35  for processing citizenship applications, to be introduced  from tomorrow (20 August).

 He said the fee would not only assist in meeting some of  the cost of granting citizenship but would also make  possible the introduction of a much better quality  Certificate of Australian Citizenship. Details of the new  certificate would be announced shortly.

 This fee, the Minister said, compared favourably with  those charged in other countries. For example, in the  U.K. the fee was $A353, in New Zealand $A37, in Canada  $A25-$A40, and in the U.S.A. $A70. The fee would not 

 fully recover the cost of processing applications.

 Other Departmental fees which have not been increased are:

 Application for change of status  to permanent resident $200

 Application for further  temporary entry permit $35

 Sponsorship for temporary  residents $145

 Application for permission to  work (lodged in Australia) $60

 Mr Hurford said a number of charges relating to the  activities of the Council on Overseas Professional  Qualifications (COPQ), which is responsible for mechanisms  for the recognition of overseas professional, technical  and general academic qualifications, had also been  increased in recent weeks.
