 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Labor’s big Christmas bonus for the people  smugglers  December 27, 2012

 This Christmas season the people smugglers received another million dollar pay check courtesy of the Gillard  Government’s failure to protect Australia’s borders, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael  Keenan said.

 “The hard working men and women of our Border Protection Command will get no break this holiday season as the  relentless wave of boat arrivals continue, with another 2 vessels carrying a total of 105 people intercepted in the last 48  hours,” Mr Keenan said.

 “These latest boat arrivals just reinforce Labor’s astonishing incompetence on border protection policies. 

 “The Coalition understands that in order to stop the boats from coming there must be a comprehensive suite of policies  that includes temporary protection visas and turning the boats back around when it is safe to do so. 

 “When Labor reversed these policies and demolished the robust border protection system they inherited, it reinvigorated  the people smuggling trade that now prospers throughout the region.

 “Whilst Labor remains in power the only ones who will be celebrating this holiday season are the people smugglers,” Mr  Keenan said.
