 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 2000 ARRIVALS SO FAR THIS MONTH April 19, 2013

 More than 2000 people have now arrived by boat since the beginning of April, following the interception of the latest  vessel, carrying 112 people, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice  Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “In today’s boat arrival announcements alone the Government would have already filled a third of their Malaysia  Arrangement quota,” Mr Keenan said.

 “The entire quota for the Malaysia Arrangement was filled in the first seven days of April, which highlights that even if  implemented this would have no impact on the people smuggling trade and would not stem the rapid flood of boat arrivals  at our borders.

 “You would assume that the unprecedented rate of arrivals would make the Labor Party change their failed policies but  instead they seem to cling desperately to policies, like the Malaysia Arrangement, that even their own expert panel said  would not work in its current form.

 “The Government has shown time and time again that they do not have the will or the resolve to take on the people  smugglers and stop this insidious trade,” Mr Keenan said.
