 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 4 December 2013   

 Government’s freeze on protection visas, cruel  and legally questionable   

 The Abbott government’s freeze on the issuing of protection visas to refugees is both cruel and  legally questionable, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Tony Abbott’s government is ruthless, drunk on power and it doesn’t know when to stop,” the  Australian Greens have said.   

 “We’re considering our options to see what the Parliament can do to override this freeze.   

 “There is a legal question as to whether the Minister has the power to halt the issuing of protection  visas and we are currently seeking advice.”   

 The Coalition has also introduced a bill into lower house today which would scrap Complimentary  Protection Visas.   

 “The Greens will oppose the scrapping of Complimentary Protection Visas in the Senate,” Senator  Hanson-Young said.   

 “If this bill went through the Minister would personally decide the fate of people, especially women,  fleeing torture and the threat of honour killings. This will put the fox in charge of the hen house and  the Greens will vote against it.   

 “Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison didn’t get their way in the Parliament with TPVs and now they’re  taking it out on refugees.   

 “This hissy-fit is unbecoming and has serious implications for refugees fleeing for their lives.”
