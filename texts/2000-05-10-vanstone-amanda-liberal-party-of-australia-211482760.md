  MEDIA RELEASE 

  Minister for Justice & Customs   Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone   Senator for South Australia 

  6312000 IO May 2000 

  Suspected illegals intercepted 

  A Customs Coastwatch Dash-8 aircraft, on a programmed surveillance   flight, and Navy patrol boat H/WAS Bendigo detected a vessel carrying a   group of 66 suspected illegal immigrants overnight, the Minister for   Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today. 

  The vessel was detected off Ashmore Islands. The suspected illegal   entrants are of Middle-Eastern origin. There were six Indonesian crew   on board. 

  The vessel is now being escorted to the mainland by HMAS Bendigo.   Customs vessel Botany Bay is en route to assist the escort operation. 

  The use of the HMAS Bendigo to transport the suspected illegal   immigrants highlights the need for a special vessel for this purpose. 

  Last nightâ€™s Budget included an announcement of a new vessel for   Australian Customs to transport intercepted boat people to the   mainland. 

  This will reduce the need to use Customs and Navy vessels as   transporters, allowing them to concentrate on the task of detecting and   intercepting suspect illegal entrant vessels. 

  Minister available through Kevin Donnellan 0419 400 078
