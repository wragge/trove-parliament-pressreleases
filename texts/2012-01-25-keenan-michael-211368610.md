 A DANGEROUS START TO 2012

 Posted on Wednesday, 25 January, 2012

 A boat carrying 121 people, intercepted north of Christmas Island this morning, is further evidence that  the people smugglers are conducting their business as usual with three boat arrivals in the first week of  the new year, the Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for  Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Labor must show some resolve, end their arms wide open policy and stop encouraging people  smugglers by taking away the product they have to sell. Julia Gillard and Labor should have no higher  priority this year than to finally tackle the border protection crisis they have created. 

 "In what will soon be 15,000 unauthorised arrivals since Labor unwound the Coalition’s proven policies  and created this problem - it is time the Prime Minister adopts the solution that we know works and  that we’ve held for a decade. 

 "Offshore processing on Nauru, a return to temporary protection visas and turning the boats back  around when it is safe and appropriate to do so will let the people smugglers know that Australia is  again serious about stopping their illegal and vicious trade," Mr Keenan concluded.
