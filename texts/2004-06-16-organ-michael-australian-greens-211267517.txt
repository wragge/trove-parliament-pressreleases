 ***** MEDIA RELEASE ***** 

 16 June 2004   

 

 SET THE CHILDREN FREE!   

 The continued incarceration of children in immigration  detention is a national disgrace, Cunningham MP Michael  Organ told Federal parliament today.   

 “The Howard government has labelled as ‘backward looking’ the Human  Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s scathing report on children in  detention rather than recognising that it actually brought the government to  account for its shameful treatment of children and their families in immigration  detention centres since 1996”, Mr. Organ told parliament.   

 “These detention centres are nothing less than prisons, and they have had,  and continue to have, a damaging effect upon the detainees.”   

 “The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says that the arrest, detention  or imprisonment of a child shall be used only as a measure of last resort and  for the shortest appropriate period of time.”   

 “The detention of children is a national shame and a national disgrace.”   

 “The people of Australia know this, children in our schools know this, the  world community knows this, and the thousands of Australians who rang bells  last week to mark four weeks since HREOC’s call for the release of child  detainees and their parents know this, yet the government persists with its  heartless behaviour”, Mr. Organ said.
