 ‘Us’, ‘Them’ and implicit religion 

 In 1996, John Howard came to power in a campaign built, according to his then 

 national campaign director, on the organising themes of ‘Us’ versus ‘Them’1. ‘We’ 

 were being marginalised, ignored and belittled by a Labor government in thrall to 

 ‘Them’, noisy, self-serving ‘special interest groups’. Just who ‘They’ were was never 

 made clear. Over three terms of government, ‘Them’ stood, at various times, for 

 Indigenous Australians, ethnic minorities, trade union members, churchgoers, 

 feminists, environmentalists, and more. 

 From July 2001, a new ‘Them’ entered the Howard government’s list of menaces: 

 Muslims. Probably, few would have predicted a surge of religious prejudice. While 

 Australia is often said to be culturally and historically Christian, and that is true at 

 least in the limited sense that its traditions and assumptions are more shaped by 

 Christianity than by any other religious tradition, it could hardly be said to be actively 

 or obviously Christian today. A country where only around nine per cent of the 

 population claim to go to church weekly, rising to the high teens for monthly, seems 

 unlikely soil for the kind of religious fervour which would find others’ views of God a 

 source of fear. 

 Commentators have tended to treat the upsurge of anti-Muslim feeling since 2001 as 

 more an expression of racism than specifically religious prejudice. Others have 

 suggested it has more to do with the alleged association between Islam and terrorism 

 than with religious values per se. This paper argues that a different picture emerges if 

 we put religion in analytical centre-stage. There are good reasons to read Australian 

 Islamophobia as evidence of powerful, if submerged and only half-articulated, 

 religious anxiety. That Australians of Christian heritage are often profoundly 

 ignorant, not only about non-Christian religions, but even about the religious 

 traditions said to be their own, only intensifies the anxiety. 

 The explicit casting of Muslims as a religious ‘them’ us best understood against the 

 background of the concurrent public conversations about religion. One conversation, 

 often loud and explicit, was about Islam. It portrayed Muslims as outsiders-within-the-nation, conduits of anti-Western views and potential terrorists (especially when 

 wearing distinctive, religiously-marked dress). That conversation gained volume from 

 the stereotypes of terrorists and asylum seekers purveyed, and intensified, by public 

 

 

 policy moves such as the anti-terrorism kit and the ASIO and security Bills.  A 

 concurrent conversation, often muted and carried on more between the lines than in 

 the headlines, was about Christianity. It portrayed ‘Christian values’ as ‘tradition’, 

 related to nationalism, civic order and public safety. To bring these two conversations 

 into focus, I first retell familiar stories of anti-Muslim prejudice, placing religion—

 rather than race of culture, for example—in centre-stage. Second, I draw out the more 

 muted, ambiguous conversation about ‘Christian values’ to delineate the particular 

 form of religious anxieties in postmodern, secular Australia. 

 People like that 

 In late July 2001, Sydney newspapers reported serial gang rapes in the western 

 suburbs, with depictions of predatory young men, a high-tech game plan, duped 

 young women and terrible ordeals. Piling detail on titillating detail, Sydney’s Daily 

 Telegraph blustered that not enough was being revealed: ‘politically correct’ police, 

 and politicians in thrall to powerful ethnic organizations, were pussy-footing around 

 the fact that the perpetrators were Muslims2. As the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board (ADB) pointed out, ‘The attacks became major news’ only once 

 ‘they were angled as a story about Lebanese, Arabic or Muslim gangs targeting white 

 Australian women’. And the ADB noted another difference: when police first tried, 

 unsuccessfully, to publicise the issue, in August 2000, Sydney was in the grip of 

 Olympic euphoria. A year later, when the story finally took off, that had been 

 replaced by ‘a growing moral panic about Arabic or Middle Eastern and Muslim 

 asylum seekers’3. The rapes had become big news because they could be mixed up in 

 a religious war on a global stage. 

 The moral panic had not come out of the blue. In 1998, former High Court Judge and 

 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity President Sir Ronald Wilson drew attention to 

 the government’s rebranding of desperate asylum seekers as ‘illegals’, despite their 

 recognition under international law4. Subsequent government opinion-shaping added 

 images of ‘queue-jumpers’, wealthy, self-serving associates of criminal people 

 smugglers. The message got through so well that, a month before the ‘gang rapes’ 

 story hit the headlines, social commentator Hugh Mackay reported that, among his 

 focus group respondents in the crucial outer-suburban marginal seats, ‘Refugees 

 previously referred to as “boat people” are now routinely described as “illegals”’, and 

 

 

 said to bring ‘unacceptable levels of crime and violence’5. By the time the year-old 

 gang rape story emerged in August 2001, the carefully-nurtured public mood was 

 fertile ground for a seemingly natural association between ‘Muslim’, ‘Middle-Eastern’ and ‘criminal’.    

 At that point, Howard was in the fatigue stage of his second term, dented by 

 devastating Coalition losses in the Western Australian and Queensland elections.  One 

 factor in the State disasters had been Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, which was not 

 delivering preferences to the Coalition parties. One Nation had launched its 

 Queensland campaign with a refugee policy: ‘We go out, we meet [the boats], we fill 

 them up with fuel, fill them up with food, give them medical supplies and we say, 

 “Go that way”’.6 Federally, Howard faced falling polls, a resurgent ALP trading off 

 GST anger and a federal election due by the end of the year. David Marr and Marian 

 Wilkinson describe how, on 8 August 2001, Howard broached using the Navy to 

 implement One Nation’s ‘push off’ border protection policy—an option long 

 championed by his hand-picked department head and ally, Max Moore-Wilton7.   

 The issue promised plenty of traction: just a week later, 345 people arrived on 

 Christmas Island, joined by another 359 the following week. Most were Iraqi and 

 Afghani Muslims. By the end of August, Australia had more than three and a half 

 thousand people in migration detention centres, and more were coming. On 24 

 August, the diminutive Palapa lost its engines, leaving its 438 passengers adrift, 

 without even a radio or positioning equipment, until their dramatic rescue by 

 Norwegian Captain Arne Rinnan of the Tampa, two days later.  

 Rinnan’s increasingly frustrated efforts to land his passengers on Christmas Island, 

 the Australian government’s stalling over medical assistance while sending an SAS 

 show of force, the tenuous ‘Pacific Solution’ and the impact of all that on the 2001 

 election have been exhaustively told by Marr and Wilkinson. Our concern is the 

 affair’s part in the continuing depiction of Muslims as the latest ‘Them’. The Howard 

 government went to extraordinary lengths to prevent the Tampa refugees ever setting 

 foot in Australia. One effect of the refugees’ isolation was that, as Marr and 

 Wilkinson note, the nearest image of them that Australian viewers saw throughout the 

 crisis was a hazy picture of a distant ship, coaxed out of a fully-extended long-distance camera lens. There is nothing like distance for keeping ‘Them’ scary. 

 

 

 Literature scholar Suvendrini Perera, in an article called ‘A Line in the Sea’, describes 

 community and personal responses to the Tampa asylum-seekers which emphasised 

 common humanity rather than fear. Lest such gestures appear too private, sentimental 

 or eccentric to offer a moral yardstick for a national government, Perera also recalls 

 Canadian Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien, who, facing questions about the possible 

 terrorist danger from asylum seekers and migrants, declared: 

 Let there be no doubt. We will allow no one to force us to sacrifice 

 our values and traditions under the pressure of urgent circumstances. 

 We will continue to welcome people from the whole world. We will 

 continue to offer refuge to the persecuted.8 

 Like ChrÃ©tien, Howard saw public fear of asylum seekers as a challenge to national 

 identity; but, where ChrÃ©tien saw his people’s identity threatened by giving way to 

 fear, Howard invoked a mind-spinning paradox to accuse the Tampa asylum seekers 

 of illegitimately trying to keep Australians true to our national identity. The refugees 

 were seeking ‘to intimidate us with our own decency’, he announced, as the Tampa 

 passengers tried to land in Australia9. Howard reassured us that we were 

 fundamentally decent. Sending desperate, sick and hungry people away from our 

 shores in a boat too small to legally carry them and in defiance of international law 

 could not be an indecent thing to do: if it were, decent people like us would not have 

 been doing it. Decency seemed to urge the passengers’ claim, so not ‘they’ but ‘we’ 

 were the real victims, ‘held hostage’ by our inclination to help people who proved, 

 overwhelmingly, to be genuine refugees from intolerable regimes.  

 Before Australians had time to reflect too far on these paradoxes, however, all 

 subtleties were burned away in the blaze of world events. Never mind that many of 

 the Tampa refugees were fleeing the very regime that harboured the World Trade 

 Centre and Pentagon attackers; the same Prime Minister who rushed to support the 

 US action against Afghanistan fanned the fear that every refugee was a potential 

 terrorist10. The connection was simple: they were all ‘people like that’.  

 Probably the clearest instance of attributing negative characteristics to a whole 

 segment of the community was the ‘children overboard’ affair. The last days of the 

 November 2001 election campaign were dominated by stories that asylum seekers on 

 

 

 yet another creaky, leaky smuggler vessel had thrown their children into the sea in an 

 attempt to blackmail the Australian navy into taking them to Christmas Island. 

 Though the stories turned out to be groundless, they were unwaveringly recycled by 

 Howard and his then Defence Minister, Peter Reith. Although keeping asylum seekers 

 off Australian shores was, since the Tampa, official government policy—with the 

 whole costly machinery of the navy’s Operation Relex to back it up—the ‘children 

 overboard’ image allowed Howard to paint the asylum seekers’ rebuff as all their own 

 fault. ‘I don’t want people like that in Australia’, an ‘angry’ Howard told the 

 Melbourne Herald Sun, repeating the line in successive interviews11.  

 People like what, exactly, was not spelled out; he could hardly have supposed that 

 every adult on the boat had thrown a child into the water—still less, on every 

 approaching boat—but they had all become ‘people like that’. General allusions to the 

 ‘illegal’ nature of asylum seekers’ arrival had given way to personal vilification, 

 playing on the most emotional of bonds, between parents and children. In fact, it was 

 Howard who was throwing children ‘overboard’—or, at least, shoving them out to 

 sea.  

 The story seemed tailor-made to build up the picture of asylum-seekers as ‘Them’, a 

 ‘sort of people’ wholly alien to ‘Us’, treating even their children in cavalierly self-interested ways ‘We’ could never comprehend or countenance. It was the latest twist 

 in the line of inference and allusion which linked Muslims, suburban teenage 

 criminals, international terrorists, fundamentalist theocrats and desperate asylum 

 seekers together as ‘Them’. Spelling out the connections could only have weakened a 

 set of associations that thrives between the cracks of conversation.  

 Religion, race and ‘Them’ 

 Drawing on detailed polling during the racially-charged 1988 US presidential 

 campaign, Princeton political scientist Tali Mendelberg demonstrates in her book, The 

 Race Card, that, for white audiences, race remains a powerful political motivator. 

 But, for post-1960s voters, imbued with the ideal of racial equality, the most effective 

 racial appeals are the least specific. White audiences who know that racism is bad 

 need to be able to assure themselves, even as they respond to racially-charged 

 triggers, that they are reacting for non-racial reasons. If they cannot so assure 

 themselves, the political trigger is much less effective.12  

 

 

 That pattern is evident in Australian Islamophobia. Although conservative columnists 

 linked the gang rape story to ‘the Muslim community’s … cultural issues’13, they did 

 not directly claim, for example, that all Muslim men are rapists. Nor did anyone make 

 bald assertions that all Muslims are terrorists, queue jumpers, fake refugees or child 

 abusers. Such overt prejudice would have drawn attention to its own implausibility. 

 Instead, repeated references to ‘the sort of people’ who would do such things 

 combined into an implicitly anti-Muslim message which nevertheless contained what 

 Mendelberg identifies as an essential element of a successful implicit appeal: 

 deniability. So, even as Howard wove together fears about asylum seekers, the 

 regimes they were fleeing, terrorism and unproven allegations of child abuse, he 

 vehemently denied any racial overtone. Refugees would be repelled wherever they 

 were from: ‘white or Japanese, or North American or whatever—it is a question of 

 protecting our borders’. He could not be appealing to prejudice, he reassured voters, 

 because, not only was he himself innocent of prejudice, but so was his audience: ‘I 

 don’t find any racism in the Australian public’14. It was just that the refugees were 

 ‘people like that’, so absolutely foreign that they might reasonably be denied even a 

 hearing.  

 The crusade against ‘Them’ 

 In the week following 11 September 2001, the Toronto Star newspaper commented:  

 ‘Acts of war’, ‘acts of terror’, ‘we’re at war’, ‘hunt down and smoke 

 out’, ‘wanted dead or alive’, ‘evil-doers’, ‘mass murderers’ and 

 ‘barbarians’ who ‘slit’ women’s throats. If the war on terrorism was 

 fought with rhetoric, US President George W. Bush may have won 

 it by now.15 

 From the beginning, Bush seemed to be commissioning his troops for a cosmic 

 showdown between the forces of evil and the forces of righteousness. All that paled, 

 though, against his announcement of a ‘crusade’ on terror and his identification of 

 Iraq as part of an ‘axis of evil’.  Both were taken as placing his government’s actions 

 in the middle east in a historical continuum with the medieval church’s crusades 

 against Islam, with all their overtones, for Muslims, of unprovoked, ideologically-driven Christian brutality. Two days after the ‘crusade’ remark, Bush’s office issued a 

 

 

 retraction, saying that all the President had meant was that the response to terrorism 

 would have the characteristics of a ‘broad cause’.16  

 Taken at face value, the apology paints staggering verbal ineptitude—what a 

 monumental brick to drop in the most diplomatically sensitive environment since the 

 end of the cold war! What extraordinary, gratuitous offence to offer at the very 

 moment of trying to assemble friends—one which could almost seem calculated to 

 produce a coalition of the affronted.  

 Observers of US political rhetoric might draw a different conclusion. Political 

 scientist Cynthia Burack points out that Christian Right leaders regularly ‘practice 

 small duplicities—such as apologies—in order to be misunderstood by the major 

 population’. Her observation is not primarily about Bush: it comes in a discussion of 

 the homophobic outbursts of politically activist televangelists such as Jerry Falwell 

 and Pat Robertson, when ‘narrowcasting’ to their ‘born again’ constituencies. That the 

 speakers apologise when addressing a mainstream public does not alter the underlying 

 message.  

 Her point is that the apology is a specific kind of ‘niche-marketing’, soothing the 

 secular audience who would be horrified by such sentiments, while letting the original 

 offence hang in the air long enough to be clearly heard by its Christian right target 

 audience. They can mentally discount the apology—‘of course, he was forced into it 

 by the politically correct liberal elites’.  For those disinclined to see the most powerful 

 man in the world as a hapless blunderer, though, Bush’s crusade ‘slip’, and belated 

 retraction, can be read as just the kind of double-entendre Burack describes. Far from 

 being an unintentional clanger, the evocation of Christian religious warfare can seem 

 ‘narrowcast’ to a Christian fundamentalist audience waiting for just such a clarion-call, and its retraction a necessary hosing-down without removing the original 

 message. 

 Following the ‘crusade’ episode, Bush took some pains to neutralise the comment, at 

 least as far as his secular and international audiences were concerned. He was shown 

 visiting a mosque, meeting Muslim leaders and repeatedly describing Islam as ‘a 

 religion of peace’. The ‘c’ word dropped from his vocabulary, though he persisted 

 with religious allusions such as the idea that ‘the liberty we prize is not America’s gift 

 

 

 to the world, it is God’s gift to humanity’ (America, the delivery boy, charged with 

 seeing the gift gets through to its recipients, want it or not)17. Bush’s iconography of 

 an anointed ‘us’ facing down a religiously threatening Muslim ‘them’ required 

 delicate handling. 

 By contrast, Howard’s messages about Muslims have been much less ambiguous. In 

 Australia, explicitly religious language cannot be relied on to carry the automatic 

 positive vibes it does for substantial American audiences. Rather, religious appeals in 

 Australian politics work more along the lines of the ‘implicit’ racial appeals described 

 by Mendelberg. In our much more secular political environment, religion is likely to 

 seem suspect in the same way that race is to post-1960s Americans. Not that religious 

 appeals don’t work in Australia—they just have to be deniable, so their subliminal 

 appeal is not interrupted by rational dissociation. 

 Having announced no crusade, Howard did not need to appear at a mosque, or protest 

 admiration for Islam. Instead, his portrayal of Muslims as the new ‘them’ picked up 

 the half-spoken list of associations forged during the gang rape and asylum seeker 

 episodes. Muslims remained firmly ‘people like that’, even when he was expressing 

 sympathy with their plight. The chasm between ‘us’ and ‘them’ was obvious, for 

 example, in his response to the deliberate burning of a Brisbane mosque shortly after 

 11 September 2001. Although newspapers reported his comments under the heading 

 ‘PM Outraged’, his indignation proved conditional: ‘If it is an act of vandalism or 

 vilification, I condemn it unreservedly’. He continued, piling on qualifications: 

 Islamic Australians are as entitled as I am to a place in this 

 community. If their loyalty is to Australia as is ours, and their 

 commitment is to this country, we must not allow our natural anger 

 at the extremes of Islam … to spill over onto Islamic people 

 generally. 18 

 By purporting to know the hearts of one part of the population (‘ours’), while raising 

 doubt about the loyalty and commitment of another, he drew a sharp division between 

 Australians; and he placed himself firmly on the righteously angry, patriotic, non-Muslim side. 

 

 

 Incidents like the mosque torching were the visible crest of a wave of street-level anti-Muslim harassment, with women and children the most frequent targets.19 Barely a 

 year later, Australia’s response to the October 2002 Bali bombing raised the 

 possibility that ‘acts of vandalism or vilification’ against Muslims were no longer the 

 exclusive work of individuals, but had become official policy. Breaking into family 

 homes during the evenings or in the early hours of the morning, handcuffing parents 

 in front of their children and confiscating personal belongings, ASIO agents 

 conducted highly public raids on the homes of people suspected of having attended 

 past public lectures by Bali-implicated cleric Abu Bakar Bashir. Victims described 

 violent methods that seemed less about catching suspects than about intimidating 

 communities. The wider public got an impressive picture of strong, security-conscious 

 government. It seemed a heavy-handed form of intelligence-gathering—and, leading 

 to neither charges nor convictions, a singularly ineffective one. That the raids took 

 place during Ramadan made the insult seem still more calculated. As the lawyer for 

 one of the raided families put it, ‘If [ASIO] had given our client the courtesy of asking 

 him to provide information, or let them interview him or even come to his house, he 

 would have opened his doors and made them a cup of tea’.20 In fact, as the Asia 

 Pacific Human Rights Network reported, at least one of those raided had contacted 

 ASIO and offered to be interviewed. ASIO personnel refused his offer, only to come 

 crashing through his front door at dawn two mornings later.21  

 The depiction of Muslims as the new ‘Them’ had progressed so far by this time that 

 violent images of armed men breaking into the homes of sleeping families, rather than 

 evoking fear of government terror tactics, showed up in opinion polls as reinforcing 

 the government’s standing as strong on national security.22 Howard declared himself 

 ‘one hundred percent’ behind the raids on Indonesian Muslims: 

 These raids relate to investigations concerning individuals. People 

 who claim that this is in some way targeting Islamic sections of 

 Australia are just, in my opinion, deliberately trying to create a 

 difficulty that does not and ought not exist.  23 

 The facts that the raids used unnecessary force and maximum family disruption at the 

 time of greatest potential religious offence to obtain no evidence against people who 

 

 

 had, in some cases, already come forward all melted into a perfect example of 

 Mendelberg’s ‘denial’.  

 Other people’s dogma 

 While endorsing actions which reinforced the updated version of ‘Us’ and ‘Them’, 

 Howard’s spoken responses tended to be brief, ambiguous and elliptical, leaving 

 plenty of room for denials of prejudice, but also plenty of cracks in which implicitly 

 religiously vilifying messages could thrive.  

 One issue, though, elicited a long exchange in which the shifting, un-pin-downable 

 nature of ‘Them’ became strikingly apparent. Sydney radio talkback host John Laws 

 asked Howard how he felt about NSW Legislative Councillor and maverick Uniting 

 Church minister Rev Fred Nile’s suggestion that Muslim women should not be 

 allowed to wear full body and head coverings in public because the clothes might 

 conceal weapons—indeed, as Laws put it, ‘we don’t even know if they’re women 

 because they’re that covered’.  

 Howard gave his customary reassurances of Australian decency, tolerance and 

 commitment to equality: ‘We have to respect each other in these things. It’s just a 

 question of civilised living. If you’ve got a religious faith and providing you’re not 

 flinging it in somebody else’s face, then you should be allowed to practise it.’  

 Nevertheless, Howard now inserted his ‘I understand …’ formula, which he regularly 

 uses to endorse obliquely views too extreme for direct support (his response to 

 Pauline Hanson’s fist speech being one famous earlier instance): 

 I don’t have a clear response to what Fred has put. I mean I like 

 Fred and I don’t always agree with him, but you know Fred speaks 

 for the views of a lot of people … No, look, I understand what he’s 

 getting at …  

 In the process, the Prime Minister licensed a sharp contrast between Muslim women 

 and ‘the Australian way of life’: 

 I want everybody in this country to live according to the modalities 

 of Australia … People coming to this country, whether they’re 

 

 

 Islamics [or not],  … must understand that when they come to 

 Australia they … can’t cherry pick the Australian way of life. I 

 mean, people have to sort of, they have to take the good with the 

 bad and things they don’t like, well they’ve got to live with them 

 because that’s the nature of our society. 

 Howard’s next comments, though, might have opened him to the accusation of doing 

 some cherry-picking himself: 

 We do respect very strongly equality of men and women. I think 

 that’s very, very important. And I think practices of any religion that 

 don’t meet that expectation will inevitably draw some disapproval 

 and some criticism. 

 This was the Prime Minister whose belief in the equality of the sexes led him to rejig 

 the tax and benefits system to encourage partnered mothers out of the paid workforce, 

 reinstate ‘chairman’ for convenors of Commonwealth boards and committees and 

 propose an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act to allow the Catholic Education 

 Office to offer men-only teaching scholarships24. Given his particular concern about 

 ‘practices of any religion’ that contravene equality of men and women, we might also 

 wonder at his silence on the ordination of women in the Catholic church and the 

 consecration of female Anglican bishops. 

 Much of the discussion hinged on how much covering Muslim women are obliged to 

 wear. Laws put it to Howard that ‘apparently it’s not mandatory in the Qu’ran for 

 them to do that’. By most standards of religious freedom, whether a practice is 

 mandatory or not is irrelevant—the point is that people are free to worship in the way 

 they choose. Howard, though, would have been happy to adjudicate, if only he knew a 

 bit more: 

 Well, I’m not precisely sure of what the rules of the Muslim religion 

 are on this question … I have got to frankly myself have a better 

 understanding of just how fundamental that is … Now I can’t make 

 at this stage a judgment. I’ve just had this flung at me. I’m not 

 sufficiently apprised of the tenets of Islam to fully understand that. 

 

 

 Laws reassured with a relevant authority: ‘Well I think dear Fred is, in as much as he 

 [has] obviously looked at the Qur’an, and the Qur’an doesn’t state that it is necessary 

 to have the full covering.’ Not religious freedom, but religious compulsion was the 

 issue. (Imagine if the government decreed that Catholics could go to Mass, since it is 

 compulsory, while Protestants, for whom communion is less central, could not).  

 Still more alarming is the public airing of naÃ¯vetÃ© about religious orthodoxy. It comes 

 into focus with a thought experiment, putting Christian, instead of Muslim, custom in 

 the dock. Imagine the response of Fred Nile, founder of the ‘family values’ oriented 

 Festival of Light (FOL), to a similarly-argued case about his interpretation of 

 Christianity. Suppose that, after reading the New Testament, a member of a non-Christian faith told Nile that there is no biblical reason why Christians should support 

 1950s nuclear families over other forms. They might maintain that, since Jesus was 

 often at loggerheads with his parents and siblings, while Paul argued that marriage is 

 only a second best to celibacy, the government should ban Christian heterosexual 

 couples from flaunting their family form in public. The merits of the argument (or of 

 FOL’s) are less important than that, like Nile, Laws and Howard’s view of Islam, the 

 imaginary case treats religious orthodoxy as singular, able to be determined once-and-for-all by uncritical recourse to sacred text and blind to histories of interpretation.  

 Howard’s responses were a masterpiece of double-entendre. On one hand, he made 

 noises about tolerance and inclusiveness: we respect religious diversity. Laws and 

 Howard assured listeners that ‘most Muslims … overwhelmingly’ are ‘a delight to 

 talk to’. In the same breath, they both firmly cast Muslims, and especially Muslim 

 women, as ‘them’, whom ‘we’ assess. When pressed, rather than affirm religious 

 freedom, Howard cast his response in terms of needing a better understanding of 

 Islam. His listeners could infer that, once convinced that the chador was merely 

 ‘optional’ for Muslim women, he would be happy to ban it—not only for public 

 safety but for their own good: 

 LAWS: But wouldn’t it be better if they were less conspicuous at this time? 

 HOWARD:         Well, obviously, consistent with their religious beliefs 25  

 

 

 In suggesting that Muslim women would do better to abandon non-compulsory 

 religious traditions, Howard effectively supported repression. The problem, in other 

 words, was Islam, not prejudice.  

 Other people’s fears 

 As a result of such implicit appeals, from ‘illegals’ to ‘rapists’ to ‘terrorists’ to ‘child 

 abusers’, Australian Muslims were been repeatedly made to bear collective 

 opprobrium in ways other communities are not. Muslims were portrayed as 

 collectively responsible for other people’s perceptions of them, even when the 

 perceptions were groundless or the result of deliberate misrepresentation. 

 This became particularly prominent in 2003, when federal Education Minister 

 Brendan Nelson wrote to his state counterparts asking for extra scrutiny of Islamic 

 schools to allay fears that they were encouraging ‘anti-Christian and anti-Western 

 sentiments’. Curiously, Nelson claimed not to be reflecting his own concerns—he was 

 reportedly ‘confident’ that no such sentiments were being taught, and praised the 

 Islamic schools’ charter promoting peace and mutual respect, making it unclear what 

 the requested scrutiny would achieve. Nelson told State ministers the fears came from 

 ‘concerned citizens’, and he was worried that their negative perceptions might spread.  

 Nelson’s declaration of personal confidence in Islamic schools was corroborated by 

 the chair of the Australian Council for Islamic Education in Schools, Mahomed 

 Hassan, quoting a letter he had received from Nelson two months earlier, praising the 

 schools’ charter. So, the fact that Nelson then aired doubts to State ministers struck 

 Hassan as ‘hypocritical’. Tabling the Nelson letter in the Queensland Parliament, 

 State Education Minister Anna Bligh argued that Nelson’s first recourse should have 

 been to allay the ‘concerned citizens’’ fears himself. Instead, she argued, ‘By issuing 

 a “please explain” to state education ministers on the quality of Islamic schools he has 

 used his position to add weight to these unfounded fears and to pour petrol on the fire 

 of prejudice’. She might have added that putting the onus on Muslim schools to 

 counter allegations he knew to be unfounded, rather than trying to correct the 

 prejudice at its source, furthered the perception of Muslims as ‘them’. Once again, 

 Islam, not prejudice, was made to seem the problem.26   

 

 

 The schools controversy erupted around the same time as another initiative which laid 

 the government open to charges of implicit racism, the ‘fridge magnet’ campaign. 

 Like the post-Bali raids, the medium seemed to be the message. In 2003 the federal 

 government posted every household in Australia a booklet and fridge magnet with 

 information about what to do in the event of a terrorist strike, phone numbers to ring 

 to report suspicious behaviour and space to write in items of household information 

 such as the location of the gas meter (the relevance of the latter in avoiding terrorist 

 attack was left to the householder’s imagination). As University of NSW political 

 scientist Matt McDonald points out in a detailed analysis of the anti-terrorism kit 

 campaign, international relations theory has long noted the way governments 

 ‘constantly attempt to create fear of “others” outside the nation as a means of 

 garnering support for specific practices and achieving or maintaining support for the 

 government itself.’ Viewed in that light, the kit’s purpose seemed to be ‘augmenting 

 … domestic fear of terrorism’. Its mission was arguably to ‘reiterate to Australians the 

 new dangers and insecurities …’, while indicating ‘that the government was “doing 

 the job” of security’27.  

 McDonald sees the kit as part of a government strategy to facilitate the passage of two 

 controversial pieces of legislation then being debated in Parliament. The ASIO 

 Legislation Amendment Bill promised ASIO powers to detain, incommunicado and 

 without legal representation, people—including children as young as fourteen—

 suspected of being connected with, or having information about, terrorism. The 

 Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill included a 25-year or life term for a 

 designated ‘terrorist act’ and gave the Attorney-general power to proscribe terrorist 

 organizations.  

 Given the controversy surrounding the Bills, and the fact that they seemed to curtail 

 civil liberties in ways unnecessary to the goal of containing terrorism, one could 

 equally see the legislation, and the publicity surrounding it, as further ‘fear 

 augmentation’28. The Bills painted a ‘them’ so dangerous (even when children) that 

 normal civil liberties should not apply. Coupled with the anti-terrorism kit’s invitation 

 to spot suspicious activity and dob in anyone whose behaviour did not ‘add up’, the 

 new ASIO powers arguably offered not increased security, but a heightened sense of a 

 half-visible menace. 

 

 

 Our values 

 The national conversation about Islam (largely carried on by non-Muslims, deaf to the 

 attempted contributions of Muslims) forms one part of early twenty-first century 

 Australia’s religious anxieties. The other big part was a quieter, less headline-grabbing conversation about Christianity. Its most frequent expression was in growing 

 talk about values.  Everyone seemed worried about who’s got them, who needs them 

 and how to impart them; but no one said what they are. All the talk about them 

 assumed that everyone knows what ‘values’ are. No one questioned them: apparently, 

 everyone does know what everyone else means when they talk about ‘values’. Except 

 me: I found myself increasingly confused. 

 Howard began it, with an apparently off-the-cuff remark about the drift of students 

 from state to non-government schools. The state system, he said, had become, ‘too 

 politically correct and too values-neutral’. He glossed the remark by explaining that 

 parents were frustrated with a lack of ‘traditional values’. A Sydney Morning Herald 

 editorial made me feel I was not, after all, quite alone in my confusion, observing, 

 ‘these phrases are code—but for what it is hard to say’29.  

 The only clue Howard offered, either in the initial interview or in any of the numerous 

 follow-up pieces, was that some schools ‘think you offend some people by having 

 nativity plays’.  Searching earlier sources, the Herald’s Mark Riley found that this 

 was not the first time Christmas traditions had come in for prime ministerial 

 championship: in 2002 Howard had inveighed on Melbourne radio against 

 kindergartens’ alleged ‘banning’ of Santa and department stores’ dropping nativity 

 scenes from Christmas displays, which he labeled ‘not very impressive’ and ‘a cave-in to political correctness’. Riley also unearthed a piece of vintage Howard outrage 

 over NSW Premier Bob Carr’s 1997 intervention to stop a NSW state school’s annual 

 passion play. In fact, the State government had intervened not on religious grounds 

 but because parents had complained that the whipping, spitting and humiliation scenes 

 were too graphic for young children. Riley concluded that the collection of 

 instances—‘Easter plays, Christmas nativity scenes and old Saint Nick’—indicated 

 that ‘“values” has become his shorthand for “religious values”’. In fact, the traditions 

 cited all relate (though tenuously in Santa’s case) to a single religious tradition. 

 Riley’s Herald colleague, Linda Doherty, was more precise, pointing out that to 

 

 

 ‘Howard, his ministers and talkback radio callers’, ‘values’ referred not to just any 

 religion, but meant Christian values30. 

 Similarly, the language of ‘banning’ evokes religious censorship, raising the 

 theocratic ghosts of ‘them’. From his 1995 campaigns against ‘political correctness’, 

 Howard had given ‘censorship’ an additional meaning—the ‘pall’ of elite prohibitions 

 which, he claimed, the ‘chattering classes’ had draped over the social landscape, 

 which the silenced ‘we’ pierce only at our peril. While the kindergarten ‘banning’ of 

 Santa conjures up images of spiky-haired teachers barricading doors and chimneys 

 against the white-haired old fellow’s doddery efforts to reach the innocents within, it 

 is hard to see how it could mean more than that the (unnamed) kindy had decided to 

 hold a Santa-less Christmas party. (The childcare centres I’ve had to do with lately 

 enjoy an annual visit from the Christmas Fairy, a trend I had put down not to ideology 

 but to scarcity of fathers willing to don the furry red suit in midsummer—no one to 

 my knowledge has interpreted Santa’s absence as a ‘ban’). 

 During an interview with Sydney talkback host Alan Jones, Howard did dredge up 

 one more concrete instance: a Queensland Education Department suggestion that 

 schools replace Christmas observance with a celebration focusing on year’s end and 

 holidays. This, he said, was an ‘attempt to sort of bland down any kind of traditional 

 approaches in our country’. That blanding-down was a symptom of political 

 correctness, which he saw as the root of discourtesy, incivility and, ultimately, even 

 the kind of street violence that produced that week’s other big news story, the death of 

 cricketer David Hookes31.  

 Far from blanding down, the multicultural classrooms I know have preferred a 

 multiplicity of religious observances, with children introducing one another to their 

 respective traditions. Howard’s claim of secularist censorship surely belongs more to 

 the overheated religious atmosphere of North America, where, at the time of writing, 

 courts are considering whether the Pledge of Allegiance should be said in schools 

 (with its polarising cold war addition ‘under God’)32 and whether the Ten 

 Commandments may be displayed outside court houses (many of them, it turns out in 

 a truly American twist, placed there originally by Cecil B. de Mille to promote his 

 movie of that name)33. Those are just the most recent in a long string of court battles 

 over the detail of what religious references may be made in US public life (sometimes 

 

 

 summed up as the ‘plastic reindeer test’: if a Christmas nativity tableau appears with a 

 sufficient proportion of reindeer and other secular decorations, it is cultural, not 

 religious, and therefore permissible34). One possible lesson from the bitter American 

 fights, where each successive judgment deals a body blow to one side or the other, is 

 that the more rigidly people’s deepest commitments are excluded from public life, the 

 more easily they retreat into resentful fundamentalism of the kind that exploded into 

 the Oklahoma bombing35. Howard’s out-of-the-blue musings about ‘politically 

 correct, values-neutral’ public schools seemed an attempt to translate that vote-rich 

 feeling of frustrated exclusion into Australia’s much more laid-back religious climate. 

 What faith can do 

 One feature of secularisation to which sociologists of religion have long drawn 

 attention is that religion comes to be seen in increasingly instrumental terms. It 

 becomes less as a system of beliefs relating to a force which makes claims upon us, 

 than a toolbox of therapeutic and goal-setting techniques which can be adopted 

 selectively to achieve individual ends (the personal fulfilment theology of Norman 

 Vincent Peale’s The Power of Positive Thinking is a paradigm)36. Such theories 

 flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as mainline denominations’ membership rapidly 

 ebbed from their post-war crests, while the religious marketplace seemed suddenly 

 flooded with new age and faux-eastern movements offering goal-oriented fulfilment, 

 often with only the most minimal claims on converts.  

 A number of strands in the late 1990s suggested a further, more overtly political 

 development in the use of religion as instrumental. People remained willing to 

 appreciate religion as producing desirable outcomes, but they embraced it on others’ 

 behalf. I am sufficiently sophisticated not to need religious beliefs to make me moral/ 

 obedient/ compliant/ generous/ truthful, their behaviour suggests; but religion is a 

 good thing for other people to have. This development helps explain the appeal to a 

 highly secular electorate of an apparently sincerely—but not too in-your-face—

 religiously committed Prime Minister. More, it explains the attraction of other policy 

 developments of the Howard period, such as social programs which carry a 

 (particular, conservative kind of) religious aura.  

 Howard’s 2004 remarks were not the first time the drift from state to private 

 schooling had been linked to a quest for ‘values’. The Sydney Morning Herald ran a 

 

 

 major series of articles in mid-2003 documenting the transfer in federal government 

 funding from state to private schools, which the paper declared to be expanding ‘on a 

 runway trajectory’37. The Herald found parents who professed no religion hoping that 

 schools would instil ‘values’ they themselves felt incompetent to convey38. When 

 Howard’s comments reopened the issue in 2004, the paper ran a follow-up article, 

 maintaining that parents who denied any religious conviction nevertheless 

 deliberately sent their children to Christian schools in quest of ‘a better sense of 

 discipline’ and tending to the ‘spiritual and social needs’39.  

 A similar pattern is likely among those who, though lacking religious convictions of 

 their own, support religiously-inflected ‘family values’ positions such as affirming 

 marriage as exclusively heterosexual, discrimination against gay and lesbian parents, 

 opposition to euthanasia and the move towards US-style ‘faith based’ contracting out 

 government welfare services to church agencies40. On one hand, such people draw a 

 distinction between religion (meaning Christianity) and the allegedly associated 

 values: ‘I’m not a believer, but …’ On the other hand, they affirm, probably more 

 strenuously than many religious believers, an indissoluble nexus between faith and 

 morality: even if you don’t accept the theology yourself, you (or perhaps those more 

 at risk of moral lapse—single mothers, children, the unemployed) stand the best 

 chance of learning the morals, receiving the standards and absorbing the principles 

 from people who do.  To the holders of such views, a Prime Minister who not only 

 apparently believes in dogma which they themselves cannot, but also enacts it on the 

 nation’s behalf, in the form of ‘mutual obligation’, upholding exclusively 

 heterosexual marriage and so on, is a highly attractive option.  

 Howard’s vague appeals to ‘values’ work in the same way as his allusions to his 

 Methodist childhood: they add a quasi-religious weight to his frequent nostalgic 

 invocations of ‘the way things used to be’, without being religiously specific enough 

 to mark him off from the secular, amorphously spiritual ‘us’. The combination 

 contributes to a politically invaluable persona for a prime minister in a highly 

 secularized electorate, where religion (meaning some vaguely-apprehended kind of 

 Christianity) is seen as a good thing for other people to have. It makes particularly 

 effective politics in a climate of increasing fear and suspicion. Religious values, even 

 if we don’t ourselves share them, promise sincerity, right-mindedness and safety in an 

 

 

 uncertain world. How much stronger and more reassuring the promise, when the 

 world beyond our vulnerable borders is portrayed as teeming with a religiously 

 fanatical, potentially criminal ‘Them’. 

 Other people’s faith 

 In 2003, federal Treasurer Peter Costello told tertiary students about his faith. The 

 venue was the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values, a Parliament-sponsored annual conference, introduced under the Howard government and modelled 

 on a Washington program of the same name. Delegates get to quiz politicians about 

 their faith, and meet international guests such as Fiji’s successful coup leader, 

 subsequently elected President and constitutional reformer, Sitiveni Rabuka.  As well 

 as living exemplars, students study historical leadership models such as Jesus of 

 Nazareth, missionary Albert Schweizer and Mother Theresa41.  

 Costello tied his discussion of faith and values to events of the day: 

 You would have seen yesterday, the big explosion in Jerusalem, 

 maybe like me you watched the TV and you have seen video of the 

 suicide bomber who did that. He was holding a rifle in one hand and 

 a Koran in the other. He had faith and he had values, you can’t deny 

 that. He probably had more faith than all of us put together, but 

 were they the right values?  

 The example of the suicide bomber proved that not any values would do. Instead, 

 students were better off with ‘the ethic and the faith background that we come from’, 

 which Costello praised for recognising ‘the value of life over death’.42  

 Costello’s speech provides a telling link between the Howard government’s explicit 

 casting of Muslims as a religious ‘them’ through references to community tragedy, 

 women’s dress, the school system and even suicide bombing, and the more muted, 

 between-the-lines conversation about Christianity. Like the values in schools debate, 

 Costello portrayed ‘Christian values’ as ‘tradition’, related to nationalism, civic order 

 and public safety. In Costello’s speech, the traditions of Jesus of Nazareth, Mother 

 Teresa and Albert Schweizer became ‘our’ values and ‘faith background’, contrasted 

 to the misguided faith of a Qu’ran-clutching suicide bomber. Such a blatant 

 comparison between ‘our’ fine spiritual values and ‘their’ dangerous religion was the 

 

 

 exception. Usually, the fear of ‘them’ is most effective when ‘we’ and ‘they’ are only 

 obliquely marked out, because any more specific definition is liable to be 

 contradicted, losing its force. The confluence of the two religious conversations in 

 Australian public life during the Howard government’s second and third term created 

 a space in which the pictures of an embattled ‘us’ protecting ‘our’ values and a 

 menacing ‘them’, driven by the frightening values of a strange religion, could 

 flourish, half-articulated and, consequently, barely challenged.  

 Religion, race and values 

 Why should it matter whether vilification and harassment of a particular marginalised 

 group is the product of racism or religious prejudice? In an important sense, of course, 

 it doesn’t—the bullying of already vulnerable is the problem, not any putative 

 justification. However, I think that the specifically religious form the vilification took 

 in relation to the Howard government’s most prominent third-term ‘Them’ is a 

 worrying straw in the wind. In my forthcoming book43, I demonstrate that the Howard 

 government has overseen a period of Americanisation of Australian religion-state 

 relations, drawing on the strategies and, increasingly, the rhetoric, of the US Christian 

 right in support of a distinctive blend of social conservatism and economic liberalism 

 which there are good reasons to see as an enduring trend, not an aberration of the 

 current leadership.  The identification of a religious enemy in this phase of Australia’s 

 culture wars is one more step down that path.
