 Australia provides emergency assistance for Mozambicans in  Mozambique and Malawi

 Australia will provide emergency food aid and other relief assistance worth  more than $7m for displaced people in Mozambique and Mozambican  refugees in Malawi, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Neal  Blewett, announced today.

 "Over the past decade, more than five million people have been affected by  the civil strife in Mozambique. Large numbers remain dependent on  emergency food aid," Dr Blewett said. "The World Food Programme  forecasts a precarious situation for Mozambicans if additional food aid is not  provided soon. Australian emergency assistance will help alleviate the  situation."

 The relief package has a number of components. It includes 19,000 tonnes of  maize for Mozambique, channelled through World Vision Australia (10,000  tonnes) and CARE Australia (9,000 tonnes).

 World Vision Australia will receive a further $576,000 for relief assistance  programs including an agricultural recovery program, child survival work  and an emergency airlift operation to zones that until recently were under  rebel control.

 5,000 tonnes of maize will be provided to the World Food Programme for  refugee feeding programs in Malawi.

 The Salvation Army Australia will receive $40,000 for a relief project  involving Mozambican refugees in Malawi.

 Australian emergency assistance to Mozambicans is administered by the  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
