 MAJOR COMMUNITY GRANTS INITIATIVES FOR 1994-95 ANNOUNCED c  C c r m r r v  . (\ \ JS.

 An $11m package of grants to help with migrant settlement was announced today by  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus.

 “The grants will assist ethnic and other community organisations to address the  settlement needs of migrants and to improve their access to government and other  services,” Senator Bolkus said.

 The equivalent of 214.5 grants have been awarded for employment of grant-in-aid  workers, while 93 community-based projects have been funded under the Migrant  Access Projects Scheme.

 The grants range from small projects, not exceeding $10 000, to help the operations  of community groups, to larger projects, between $10 000 and $50 000, designed to  ensure better access to services.

 The grants also include a mixture of one- and three-year grants-in-aid, with an  average of about $47 500 per annum each to help community groups to employ a  specialist social welfare worker.·

 “The package ensures that priority is given to meeting the needs of recent arrivals,  without neglecting those of longer-term residents,” Senator Bolkus said.

 “The package follows on from the May 1994 Budget initiatives and addresses needs  identified in a Task Force report prepared by the Department at my request."

 These new initiatives are designed to assist ethnic communities:

 â¢ deal with the impact of unemployment and industry restructuring, focusing on  youth and migrants from a non-English speaking background (NESB);

 â¢ develop retraining schemes for NESB migrants who have been unemployed  late in their working life;

 â¢ support other proposals to enhance the participation in the workforce of NESB  migrants and ethnic communities as a whole;

 meet the particular needs of people arriving under the Humanitarian Program;

 â¢ strengthen the co-ordination and delivery of settlement services provided  through non-Government agencies;

 â¢ improve the focus of services on the needs of Humanitarian entrants.

 “Many of the newer refugee groups do not have large or well established communities  in Australia to provide support," Senator Bolkus said.

 “These people need special assistance at the initial reception and post-arrival stage.  These decisions acknowledge the added pressure community organisations face in  having to deal with social changes and the increasing dependence on their services.”

 I am particularly pleased that the high priority given to meeting women’s settlement  needs has been matched by both number of quality applications received, and grants  awarded.

 The package brings the total of Commonwealth commitment to community grants  (including the Migrant Resource Centre network) to about $21 m.
