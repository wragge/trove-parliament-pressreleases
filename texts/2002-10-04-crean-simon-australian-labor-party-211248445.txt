 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - NATIONAL CONVENTION CENTRE, CANBERRA, FRIDAY 4 OCTOBER 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: SPECIAL RULES CONFERENCE; IRAQ & WAR TAX; DEIRDRE GRUSOVIN; ALP POLICIES

 JOURNALIST: How do you think it’s going to go this weekend?  Are you confident?

 CREAN: I am confident, because I’m confident that the party wants to win the next election.  It won’t win the next election unless it modernises itself.  And that begins with revamping our structure, changing our rules, making ourselves more appealing to people to join, inviting more people in on the basis that they know that they’ve got a real say.  And I said I wanted bigger conferences so that it’s easier for people to get to conference.  And I’ve said that I want to stamp out the branch-stacking so that we build integrity into the basis upon which candidates are put forward.

 JOURNALIST: So by your own admission, you’re dead in the water if you don’t change.

 CREAN: We will change, because the conference knows we must change.  We’ve lost the last three elections and, if we don’t change, our chances of winning the next election are diminished.  That’s why conference delegates will support the changes.

 JOURNALIST: Is this just a stage-managed opportunity for, you know, Simon Crean’s leadership?  I mean, is it stitched up now, or have you got a real battle on your hands?

 CREAN: I think with all the publicity surrounding this conference, the last thing you could call it was stage-managed.  I think that what it ...

 JOURNALIST: [inaudible]

 CREAN: Of course there’s a battle.  There are people that have very strong views about the way in which the organisation runs but, look, that’s no different than people having a view about their football club.  They have all sorts of different views about the coach, and who should be playing full forward, and what’s the administration doing.  That’s the nature of any organisation.  So I don’t think people should see that in itself as unusual.  But change is always hard and, in the process of change, some people are going to be affected.  And so they will take positions.  But they’ll have the opportunity to debate those positions at this conference.  I want them to, because there has been very wide debate within the Party.  The Hawke-Wran review must have had, it received 700 submissions, it had public fora that I think had over 2,000 people attend.  There were very strong views that came forward from those people arguing the need for change.  I want this conference to stand up for them.  I want this conference to reflect what the rank and file say they want by way of change.

 JOURNALIST: Yet, what will your future be if you lose that battle?

 CREAN: My future will be as head of a Labor Government.  What comes out of this conference, if we get it right, is a Labor Government.  When people say, what’s in it for me?  I say, a Labor Government.

 JOURNALIST: But isn’t it going to be a fatal blow to your leadership if you don’t succeed tomorrow?

 CREAN: I intend to succeed.

 JOURNALIST: You said earlier that if the Party doesn’t pass the changes that you want at this conference it won’t win the next election.  What do you say to people like Joe de Bruyn and other influential people in the Party who are saying they’re going to vote against the key changes you’re putting up.

 CREAN: Well, I respect the view that they come to this conference with, but I’ll continue to talk with them, I’ll continue to debate with them. And what I want them to do is to understand the totality of the framework that I’ll be putting forward.  And I think that when people see the total package, see the dimension of the changes, see the opening up, see the renewal of the relationship with the trade union movement - not through proportions at conference, but by a genuine relationship built around the issues, built around the agendas, built around a revitalised ALAC.  These are the sorts of things people have got to weigh up, weigh up in the totality of the debate, weigh up when they have to make the final decision.

 JOURNALIST: What’s in this package of yours that you say they’re going to see and be impressed by?  Can you tell us?

 CREAN: A greater ownership of the Party by the rank and file.  A greater ability for the rank and file to participate in policy recommendations.

 A cleaning up of the branches and weeding out the branch-stackers.  An ability for the trade union movement through a revitalised ALAC to have consultations with the Labor Party about policy.  These are the important things that matter to them.

 JOURNALIST: Is 50-50 negotiable, Simon Crean?

 CREAN: I say that 50-50 has to be delivered, because 50-50 represents the equal partnership.  If we’re to open the party up, if we’re to invite people in, if we’re to try and attract more people - which is what I say the conference has got to be all about - we can only do that if we’re inviting them in on an equal partnership, not as a minority shareholder.

 JOURNALIST: Did you expect at the start of this whole process it would still be such a close-run thing on the eve of the conference?

 CREAN: Reform is hard.  I always expected that it would be hard, but it had to be done.  I’m not going to shirk responsibilities.  If the Labor Party is to position itself to win the next election, it has to take the hard decisions early.  That’s what leadership’s about.   That’s what I’m prepared to give, and that’s what I believe will be supported at this conference over the weekend.

 JOURNALIST: So no regrets?

 CREAN: No regrets.  It’s been an interesting ride.

 JOURNALIST: It’s all or nothing now, isn’t it?  It’s all or nothing.  Do you concede that if you don’t get [50-50] up, that your leadership is dead?

 CREAN: What I will concede is this:  that if we get this conference right, we have laid the basis for Labor winning the next election.  That’s why this conference is important.  What I want to do is to lay the basis for our next victory.  And I’m prepared to do, and I’m determined to achieve, what I believe is the correct path forward.  And I hope, and I expect, to get support for that direction.

 JOURNALIST: Will you personally be supporting direct rank-and-file election of delegates, and the 40-40-20 proposition for women?  Will you personally be supporting those two?

 CREAN: I’ll see you at the conference tomorrow and on Sunday, and you will know exactly my position in relation to those.

 JOURNALIST: There’s a lot of people who don’t know the numbers.  The only other reason could be that people still haven’t made up their minds.  I mean, which is it?

 CREAN: Look, this is a conference to determine the outcomes, Geoff.  I …

 JOURNALIST: So people are coming along tomorrow, and they still haven’t made up their mind?

 CREAN: What I’m saying to you is that I’ve been to many conferences in my day.  I’ve led the industrial wing of the movement, and I’ve now led the political wing of the movement.  I know better than most about those two relationships.  And I also know that people respect better the ability to consider those issues at the conference.  I’m going to pay them that respect, and I’m going to outline my views at the conference tomorrow.

 JOURNALIST: What deal has been made, or what do you think is going to happen with the issue of refugees?  A number of people have said they want to raise it on the floor of this room.  And you’ve said previously that it’s a rules conference so it’s not coming up.  And they’ve said they’re going to raise it.  Have you made a compromise?

 CREAN: Well it is a rules conference, it’s as clear as that. Everyone knows it’s a rules conference.  It was called as a rules conference, not as a policy conference. Therefore it’s a conference that can’t debate policy, it’s as clear as that.

 JOURNALIST: So when somebody stands up and says, I want to talk about the Labor Party’s position on refugees, are they going to be sat down or thrown out?

 CREAN: They’ll have to do it in accordance with the rules and the procedures that govern this conference.

 JOURNALIST: But are you prepared to set up a working party at least so the Party has more input into the refugee policy?

 CREAN: We have had considerable consultation in relation to this issue. If people want further consultation, I’m more than happy to involve them in that. That’s never been a problem for me. Anyone suggesting that that’s been a problem for me is misleading you. So we’ve got to get the policy right. You don’t get it right until you’ve had the consultations, and I’ll have whatever consultations are necessary to get it right.

 JOURNALIST: As we speak now, is the Right still holding out against 60-40 as we speak now? Is there still a battle going on behind the scenes, that’s what I’m asking?

 CREAN: All will be revealed tomorrow.

 JOURNALIST: Is it appropriate for the Governor-General to be making comments in regard to the possibility of a war in Iraq?

 CREAN: Well I haven’t heard that the Governor-General has made comments in relation to war in Iraq.  But in relation to a war in Iraq, I hope he’s saying that we’ve got to avoid it.  And I hope the Governor-General is saying that the United Nations should be the appropriate vehicle for such avoidance.

 JOURNALIST: He’s suggesting that sometimes we have to choose between a lesser of two evils, basically sort of saying that if you’ve got to war it’s not as …

 CREAN: Was he just talking war or was this a biblical analogy? Was he doing a reading or?  I don’t know, look I haven’t seen the comments, Geoff.  You know my position in relation to Iraq.  The United Nations should settle it by diplomacy, and everyone should be directing their efforts to achieving that outcome.

 JOURNALIST: There’s also been talk amongst the Uniting Church about a campaign of civil disobedience where its members might refuse to pay a war levy if one is imposed. Would you support that kind of action by people opposed to the war?

 CREAN: I’ve made my position clear.  No case has been made out for a war tax.  We won’t be supporting one if they put one forward now.

 JOURNALIST: Just another thing, this is back to the National Executive. Were you angered by the fact that the Deirdre Grusovin preselection issue came up to the National Executive? It was said this morning that it distracted from the main game?

 CREAN: No, look there’ve been all sorts of distractions. There have been highs and lows in this process in the lead-up to the conference. This is just one of the many things that you have to deal with in the course of leadership of the Labor Party. And I’ll front up to all of my responsibilities, and that’s why I was there last night. I’m delighted to say that the outcome last night was unanimously arrived at.

 JOURNALIST: What do you make of Iraq’s criticism of Australia’s behaviour in the Gulf at the moment, the Australian Navy?

 CREAN: I haven’t seen that criticism. I can’t comment.

 JOURNASLIST: Mr Crean, after this conference and if you succeed in getting your agenda up, a number of people are going to say, ‘That’s fine, that’s great, you’ve modernised the Party.  When are we going to see the policies?’  What’s your answer to that?

 CREAN: I say have a look at the policies that we’ve already put out. Have a look at our commitment to Paid Maternity Leave. Have a look to our commitment to making the corporate crooks own up, and penalise them. Have a look at our commitment in terms of the protection of workers’ entitlements.  Have a look at our commitment in terms of making housing more affordable.  Have a look at our commitment to retain Telstra in public ownership.  Have a look at our commitment in terms of requiring the banks to have a social charter.

 Now I can go on, Phillip. But the truth is, don’t misrepresent our position as having no policy. We clearly have policy out there, and policy that the Government has either been forced to embrace - such as in the case of Iraq -that it will be forced to embrace, in the case of Maternity Leave, in the case of corporate governance, in the case of a whole range of other issues.

 Labor will continue to put out constructive policy outcomes. I said when I took the leadership, I wanted this to be a Party that proposed initiatives, didn’t just oppose theirs.  And I’ll continue to do that.
