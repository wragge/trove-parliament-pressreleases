 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - MELBOURNE - 10TH AUGUST 2002.

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Hawke Wran Review; Party Reform; Pacific Solution and Wheat sales to Iraq. 

 CREAN: I’m delighted with the response to the report. It’s a blueprint for the party to move forward. I urge all Party members to get behind it and I think that when people read the totality of the report, understand it they will support it very strongly indeed.

 JOURNALIST: …that you’re pleased with the response, there really hasn’t been one. It’s been very muted for something that’s been flagged for such major reform?

 CREAN: These are major reforms and people who’ve read the report believe it is an excellent report. The detail of implementing that report is now the task at hand but I believe that the goodwill is there to implement this reform, it’s essential that we do it. It is about opening up the Party. It’s about giving greater ownership to the members so I urge the members to read it and get behind backing it. It’s important that these reforms are implemented.  

 JOURNALIST: Do you have the timeframe for implementation?

 CREAN: Yes, the timeframe is the October Special Conference. We meet on the 5th and 6th of October to endorse the recommendations, giving effect to this report.

 JOURNALIST: What about the women’s criticism…? 

 CREAN: I’ve seen those. I urge them to read the report fully. It’s a strong commitment to getting more women into the Parliament. But it argues that we’ve got to look at different mechanisms for encouraging that to happen. Simply setting the quota may not be enough and there are other reforms in the report, such as the ability for me as the Leader, for example, to influence preselections, to have a say in the preselections, which I think is a very important avenue. I’m committed to getting more women into Parliament and I

 think that people should get behind the whole thrust of the report not just pick out selective elements and not misrepresent positions contained in the report.

 JOURNALIST: …Democrats, to what degree of disarray are they still in…?

 CREAN: Well they’ll have to move quickly to sort themselves out, to get their house in order. I think that parties that can’t manage themselves get marked down by the public. But I’m intent, not just in managing ourselves but improving ourselves. And the reason I’m asking for reform of the Party is because of the message it sends to the wider public. I want a Party that’s more open. I want a Party of integrity and I want a Party of equality. They’re the same qualities of relationship I want with the Australian people. I want to be open with them. I want to be honest with them and I want to treat them as equals.

 JOURNALIST: …the October Conference. There are still plenty of people who are quietly waiting for that time…

 CREAN: I think getting to where we were was the hard bit. Party reform is hard and you’ve seen that debate taking place in the public. But I think now that the report is out, now that people can read it and not misrepresent it and now that people can see the trust and get behind a constructive approach to implementing it, we will move forward.

 JOURNALIST: What more do you have to do in the months before October to actually sell the report, Mr Crean? Will you be actively, you know, talking to the document around the country or how will you sell it?

 CREAN: Well I’ll be actively promoting it. I believe in the thrust of the report, I want to see it implemented. There is the necessary drafting of the detail of the rules to give effect to the report and I’ll be involved in that as well.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, on another matter, Michael Somare said that he’s said that he’s taking no more refugees or asylum seekers from Australia for the Pacific Solution?

 CREAN: Well this is just another example of the Pacific Solution unravelling. The Pacific Solution is not a solution. It was a political solution, not a Pacific Solution. And the sooner the Government comes up with the lasting plan the better. Now Labor offers to work with the Government to get that lasting solution. We can develop one, we’re prepared to work with the Government. Let’s work together for the nation to achieve a result. Let’s get that inclusion that I talk about, that ownership of a way forward. Not a political fix but a lasting solution.

 JOURNALIST: On another front Mr Crean, the Iraq diplomat points out that Australia is likely to lose its wheat contracts today, do you have a comment on the Government’s conduct on affairs with Iraq?

 CREAN: Alexander Downer has handled this very badly. He’s talked up the problem rather then talked about a solution and Australia and its wheat growers in particular are paying a very high price for that talking up. Alexander Downer ought to calm down. He ought to get behind the appropriate approach and that is to get the UN in there, get the weapons inspectors in there, do a proper assessment of the circumstances in Iraq. Do it with cool heads, not hot heads. Alexander Downer’s hot headedness is costing Australian wheat growers.

 JOURNALIST: …stage where this sort of retribution was exacted against Australia?

 CREAN: Well it’s a very good question. I remind you back in 1991 with the first Gulf War, which Australia supported and the Labor Party was in Government, we supported the US as part of an international effort but we did not lose wheat sales to Iraq. So it is possible to manage the trade relationship as well as the security. But you won’t get that sort of management if you’ve go the likes of Alexander Downer beating up the circumstances. Talking out of school, out of sync with the US and inflaming the situation.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)

 CREAN: No I think that obviously the American intelligence gathering has got to be a very important part of any assessment. But it has to be a coalition of support and it has to be built around the facts of the case and proper analysis not just off the top of the head statements. Alexander Downer makes the off the top of the head statements and look what happens to our wheat sales.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: The solution is to insist upon the arms inspectors going back into Iraq. There is a framework for that through the United Nations, that’s what should be pursued. And diplomatic efforts and trade efforts ought to be aimed at getting our wheat sales back on track.

 JOURNALIST: …emotive argument rather then one based on common sense then?

 CREAN: So far as Alexander Downer is concerned, yes. I’ve urged caution in this. I’ve urged consideration of all the facts. I’ve been prepared to make myself available to get across those facts. I’m prepared to work together with the Government based on the information available and make the appropriate decision at the appropriate time. But the case has to be made and it needs cool heads not hot heads.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Well I can’t speak for Iraq and I would never, ever speak for Iraq. I mean Iraq is doing the wrong thing this in not allowing the weapons inspectors in. But the fact…

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: …well, no, we’re not at war and one has to therefore question why the trade has been suspended and the suggestion is its because of the statements that Alexander Downer has made that are out of step with anything that’s coming from anywhere else. Now you make your own judgment about that as to what’s caused the loss in wheat sales.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean are you saying that Labor is opposed to any unilateral American action on Iraq, separate from the UN and separate from the weapons inspectors going back in?

 CREAN: We’ve laid down two conditions. If the link can be made to Al Quaeda that would be consistent with joining with them on the War Against Terror. Such a link has not yet been made and as I understand it the Americans say, can’t be made at the moment. The second basis is through the UN approach, which is to get the arms inspectors in. That process has to be exhausted before further action is taken and we will always be available to talk with the US, receive information, receive intelligence if any other developments happen. But let’s make decisions based on the facts not just wild rhetoric.

 JOURNALIST: What could Australia lose in (inaudible) until this problem’s sorted out?

 CREAN: You mean Iraq? Well Australia obviously is losing its wheat sales.

 JOURNALIST: In monetary terms?

 CREAN: I’m not too sure of the amount. You’d have to speak to the wheat growers about it.

 JOURNALIST: …$29 million?

 CREAN: It could be, I mean we’re a big supplier. May I remind people that we didn’t lose the sales to Iraq when Australia joined the coalition against it back in ‘91.

 JOURNALIST: Because Alexander Downer was not the Foreign Minister?

 CREAN: Absolutely, because you had a Labor Government in place and it knew how to get the balance right. Anyway as I understand it Alexander Downer doesn’t want to remain the Foreign Minister, he wants to become the Deputy and Treasurer.

 JOURNALIST: Just back on the report on the review, is there are plan for you to go around (inaudible).

 CREAN: Look the consultation with the branch members has been massive. 2000 people have turned up at meetings all around the country, submissions have been made. The report will be mailed out to all Party members, they will discuss it in their own branches. My urging to Party members is to get behind the push for reform because what it means for them is a greater say, a greater say in policy, a greater say in conferences and of course I’ll pushing that agenda.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: I have many tasks to do over the course of the next couple of months, this is but one of them. There are important policy considerations that we need to develop. I believe that when people read the report they’ll understand the importance of this reform. I’ll continue to promote it. The most important thing is to get our policy agenda moving forward again. We’ve already come out with key announcements on Maternity Leave, on protection of worker entitlements, on tax cuts for working families. We’ve got to get out and promote these as well so I’ll have lots of opportunities to promote many parts of that agenda.
