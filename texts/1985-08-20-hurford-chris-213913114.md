 MIGRANT SETTLEMENT PROGRAMS

 1 Teaching English

 2 Refugee Children

 3 Migrant Centres

 4 Review of Post-Arrival Services

 Funds to help migrants settle in Australia will increase  in 1986. 1 

 â ' " t

 Expenditure on post-arrival services, excluding migrant  accommodation, will rise $5.4m to $60.5m, an increase of  9.8 per cent.

 Most of the increase will be in teaching English and  looking after refugee children without parents in  Australia.

 Migrant accommodation will be changed from the Silver City  or hostel style to self-contained units in which  newly-arrived refugees prepare their own meals.

 Closing and selling some old-style hostels and  redeveloping others on the self-contained model will  reduce the cost of migrant accommodation from $14m in  1984-85 to $10.6m in 1985-86.

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr  Hurford, said the changes in post-arrival services  reflected the importance the Government placed on helping  settle migrants in Australia.

 Mr Hurford added that $250,000 had been allocated for a  review of post-arrival services. This would ensure  migrants were assisted in the best possible ways.

 TEACHING ENGLISH

 "Expenditure on the Adult Migrant Education Program will  increase $3.7m to $46m," Mr Hurford said.

 Parliament House, Canberra

 "AMEP teaches English to migrants and is vital to'  successful settlement.

 "This year's budget puts special emphasis on an  English-in-the-Workplace program. An extra $300,000 will  be provided for this in 1985/86, bringing total  expenditure to $ 1.4m."

 Mr Hurford added that the Government had increased funding  for English-in-the-Workplace by $600,000, or 75 per cent,  since it had come to office. â 

 The language needs of migrant workers were a high priority. i

 Another $200,000 would be spent on special English classes  for unemployed youth.

 These initiatives complemented other recent improvements  such as providing child care for migrant parents who  wanted to attend English classes.

 REFUGEE CHILDREN

 The budget provides an extra $360,000 for the welfare of  refugee minors without parents in Australia. The States  will match Commonwealth grants.

 Workers employed under these grants will counsel refugee  children and those who look after them.

 Mr Hurford said this money would complement the  Commonwealth's maintenance allowance for refugee children  who are wards of the Minister. Maintenance payments will  increase from $0.8m in 1984/85 to $ 1.09m in 1985/86.

 MIGRANT CENTRES

 The eta of big, institutionalised migrant centres is over.

 The old-style hostel with mess halls, serviced rooms and  extensive grounds is costly to run and not popular with  residents.

 Cafeteria food cannot satisfy the many different  nationalities in residence. Security is also a worry  because of outside laundries and ablution blocks.

 "Institutionalised living is prompting many new arrivals  to move out before essential language and orientation  programs have been undertaken," Mr Hurford said.

 "This leads to subsequent settlement problems."

 The new, renovated centres will comprise self-contained  units with their own bedrooms,  kitchens and laundries.

 One of the new-style cehtres is being built at Pennington,  in Adelaide. It will cost $2.46m and accommodate 78  people. Brisbane's Wacol migrant centre is being  redeveloped at a cost of $6.23m and will offer 167  bedrooms.

 "A beauty of the new-style centres is that they will pay  for themselves," Mr Hurford said.

 "Savings on operating costs, and selling land and assets  tied up in the big, old centres, will fully offset the  cost of conversions." .

 "The new centres will be flexible, inexpensive and capable  of being used for other purposes if demand for migrant  centre accommodation falls."

 Four old style migrant centres will be vacated:

 Enterprise (Springvale,  Victoria), Endeavour  '  (Coogee, NSW), Mount St Canice (Hobart) and Tamarind (Darwin).

 Enterprise has a capacity of 900 but now has only 534  residents. The figures for the other centres are:   Endeavour 850 and 344, Mount St Canice 70 and 30, Tamarind  70 and nil.

 Enterprise's migrants will move to the Midway Centre at  Maribyrnong and Endeavour's to the Westbridge Centre at  Villawood.

 "If the Pennington and Wacol redevelopments are as  successful as I hope they will be, Enterprise and  Endeavour may follow," Mr Hurford said.

 He said many refugees were going straight into the  Australian community with the support of caring  Australians and the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme.

 In 1984/85 up to 2,000 refugees had been taken directly  under the wing of Church and community groups who found  them accommodation, furniture and jobs. The CRSS  subsidised groups which helped resettle refugees. Payments under CRSS had been increased sharply.

 Mr Hurford said the scheme had worked well, particularly  in the country. He stated he hoped there would be an  increased response to the CRSS particularly in Hobart and  Darwin.

 Review of Post-arrival Services

 A review of post-arrival services will be made in 1986 to  ensure services meet the real needs of migrants.

 The 1985/86 Budget includes $250,000 for the review.

 Mr Hurford said the Government would also publish an  annual report 

 He said the first report would be published at the end of  the year. .  ,

 "The Hawke Labor Government has tried to make Government  Departments sensitive to the needs of migrants". Mr  Hurford said.

 "The Report will allow people to check our policy against  the reality."
