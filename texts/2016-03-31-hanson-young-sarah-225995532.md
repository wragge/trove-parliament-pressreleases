 MEDIA RELEASE   

 

 Thursday, 31 March 2016   

 

 Polling shows Australians want solutions, not refugee cruelty   

 

 Polling released today has shown that the majority (58.1%) of South Australian’s want to see people  seeking asylum, who are in need of protection, resettled in Australia while only 25.9% of South  Australians support the government’s cruel policies of detention on Manus Island and Nauru.   

 

 The polling found similar results in the Federal seats of Indi and New England.   

 

 “Australians want to see solutions, not more government cruelty,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 

 “Along with the majority of Australians the Greens believe that, after having their claims assessed,  people found to be in danger should be resettled in Australia.   

 

 “It’s clear that we should be processing people’s claims for asylum in our region and then bringing  those who need protection to Australia safely, so that they can get on with rebuilding their lives.   

 

 “The government’s choice to lock people in appalling detention camps on Nauru and Manus Island is  deeply unpopular.   

 

 “It’s time the government admitted it has no exit strategy when it comes to offshore detention and  got on with protecting people who are in need.”
