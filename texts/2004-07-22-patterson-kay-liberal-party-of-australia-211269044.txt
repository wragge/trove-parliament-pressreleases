 Prime Minister's Community Business Award Winners Boost People with  Disabilities and Disadvantaged Youth in South Australia

 22/07/2004

 The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson, today  congratulated two South Australian partnerships, for winning 2004 Prime Minister's  Awards for Excellence in Community Business Partnerships in South Australia.

 The two award-winning partnerships have been recognised for outstanding contributions  to the community, by providing jobs and training for people with disabilities and  improving the lives of disengaged and disadvantaged youth.

 The SA Large Business Award has been won by a partnership between Electrolux Home  Products Pty Ltd (Services and Spare Parts) and Phoenix Society Incorporated for  providing training and job opportunities for people with disabilities.

 Phoenix has five facilities in SA, which offer employment and training opportunities for  385 people with varying degrees of disability. Phoenix has provided a number of  employees to Electrolux and supervises their training and work performance. It has also  provided the necessary infrastructure and support to maintain a disability employment  program.

 Electrolux originally outsourced some of its labour requirements to Phoenix but then  provided opportunities for people to work within its Woodville North facility. The company  provided physical infrastructure including buildings and equipment, which gave people  with disabilities the chance to work in a commercial manufacturing facility.

 This arrangement has enabled a reduction in travelling time for the employees and given  them greater exposure to a mainstream workplace where they are gaining valuable  training and skill development. Phoenix's involvement in management of work production  targets has also improved the employees' expertise.

 "The partnership has given Electrolux access to a reliable source of labour and greater  flexibility to respond to work demands. Other staff have benefited from first hand  experience of the issues related to employment of people with disabilities and training by  Phoenix," Senator Patterson said.

 "This partnership has enabled people with disabilities to gain skills and develop self-esteem which has equipped them to progress through the employment and training  process and win jobs in mainstream employment.

 "It has not only helped people with disabilities to make the transition to the open  workforce it is also shown others how this can be achieved on a broader scale."

 The SA Medium Business Award has been won by the partnership between Burns for  Blinds and Youth Opportunities Association for its work in improving the lives of  disengaged and disadvantaged youth.

 Burns for Blinds, a successful SA blind furnishing company and Youth Opportunities, a  seven-year-old non-profit organisation, have conducted programs to empower young  people with skills, confidence and the motivation to break cycles of under-achievement,  marginalisation and poverty in their communities.

 Youth Opportunities has been working with 11 SA schools located in areas with low socio-economic demographics. To date, 93 per cent of more than 300 graduates have won jobs  within three months of finishing the program. Youth Opportunities' success has been  recognised by the SA government as offering a key solution to the state's most  problematic schools.

 The company has been recognised for its contribution to the community with positive  results for its customer base and suppliers. Sales turnover has increased from $1.5  million to $9 million a year through the partnership. The company won the Prime  Minister's Award for Excellence in Business and Community Partnerships (SA) two years  ago in the Small Business category.

 "This program is achieving results by changing the outlook of young people from being  victims of circumstance to being leaders," Senator Patterson said.

 State Encouragement Awards have also been made to the partnership, Libby Hogarth and  Associates and Australian Refugee Association (ARA) Inc, in the Small Business category  and Fisher Jeffries and Helpmann Academy partnership in the Medium Business category.

 Libby Hogarth, a professional migration service and the non-profit organisation, ARA,  have given migration assistance to 1500 people in the past three years and their  partnership has helped refugees rebuild their lives.

 The partnership between legal firm, Fisher Jeffries and the high achieving non-profit  Helpmann Academy, has supported young and emerging artists and helped launch many  artists into successful professional careers.

 Fisher Jeffries has helped develop a grants scheme, which has distributed more than  $900,000 to young and emerging artists. The partnership's Fisher Jeffries Christmas Card  Commission Competition has become a regional and national benchmark in creative  marketing as well as a springboard for Helpmann Academy students to achieve  professional recognition in the wider community.
