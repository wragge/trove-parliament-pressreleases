 Background Paper on Unauthorised Arrivals Strategy MPS 131/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock today released a background paper on the Government's approach to the problems of irregular migration and people smuggling.

 Mr Ruddock, who is in Indonesia with ministerial colleagues for a series of meetings, said the strategy has been constructed around an integrated, comprehensive approach, which recognises that these are international problems that require international solutions.

 "In particular, these problems are intertwined with the longstanding and unresolved refugee caseloads around the world for which the international community needs to develop solutions," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This stands in stark contrast to claims by the Opposition. The Opposition leader's comments expose him and his colleagues as unaware of the complexity of the problem and bereft of ideas."

 The Government's approach comprises three major elements:

 prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and secondary outflows from countries of first asylum; 1.  

 working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and intercept their clients en route to their destination, while ensuring that those people in need of refugee protection are identified and assisted as early as is possible; and

 2.  

 developing appropriate reception arrangements for unauthorised arrivals who reach 3.  

 Australia, focusing on the early assessment of the refugee status of the individual, the prompt removal of those who are not refugees, or who are refugees but can access effective protection elsewhere, and the removal of additional benefits not required by the Refugees Convention to minimise the incentive for people to attempt illegal travel to Australia.

 "A key element is the development of a broad international consensus on the need for action and strengthened cooperation," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I have been working to this end by developing strong relationships with source, first asylum, donor, destination, and transit countries, in international forums and with the UNHCR and other international organisations over the past five years."

 Initiatives undertaken through this strategy include:

 seeking reform of the international protection system to ensure that protection is available to those who need it, in the countries where they first seek asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the provision of $12 million in 2000-01 in targeted humanitarian aid to ameliorate the range of "push" factors in countries of origin and first asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 engaging the international community to increase its humanitarian support to countries of origin and first asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 an information campaign, targeted both domestically and overseas, entitled "Pay the People Smuggler and Pay the Price"; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the establishment of cooperative disruption arrangements with Indonesia and Cambodia; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 strengthening penalties for those involved in people smuggling; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of temporary protection visas to reduce the attractiveness of Australia for those seeking to enter illegally and claim asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of legislation to exclude those who have access to effective protection elsewhere from Australia's asylum process; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of legislation to prevent abuse of the judicial process to extend the stay of people who have no entitlement to be here; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of legislation to protect the integrity of the Refugees Convention and to ensure that its definition is brought back to what it originally intended; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 allocation of an additional $14.3 million to support initiatives to resolve the situation of displaced Afghanis; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 improving detention capacity and shortening processing times for unauthorised arrivals; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 increased dialogue with countries of origin and first asylum aimed at putting in place an interlocking web of return and readmission agreements. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "The Government is committed to the implementation of this strategy and I will be undertaking a range of initiatives in the coming months to ensure that our national interests continue to be pursued," Mr Ruddock said

 "The attached paper details the approach the government has taken and will continue to take in dealing with this complex and difficult problem," he said.

 Introduction

 Historically, Australia has enjoyed a high degree of control over those who enter and live in this country. Illegal migration to Australia, however, is not a new phenomenon.

 The first significant influx of illegal arrivals came by boat between 1975 and 1980 when more than 2000 Indochinese arrived fleeing oppressive regimes and internal conflict in Vietnam and Cambodia.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A further 200 Cambodians arrived unauthorised by boat in 1989-90 to escape fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the new Cambodian government. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Throughout the 1990s there has been a regular flow of unauthorised arrivals by boat from China, with a total of 1,867 arriving between 1989 and 2000. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In response, the then Government amended the Migration Act in December 1992 to require that all non-citizens who are unlawfully in Australia must be detained and removed as soon as practicable, unless they are granted a visa authorising their stay. In November 1994, 'safe third country' legislation was enacted that provided for the return of an unauthorised arrival to a country of prior protection.

 At the time the Coalition came to Government in March 1996, there were a total of 212 unauthorised boat arrivals from China in detention - many had been there several years. The ALP Government had no strategy for returning people who had failed asylum claims or who did not otherwise have an entitlement to remain in Australia.

 Since 1996, Minister Ruddock has travelled to China twice, and Departmental officials on numerous occasions, to negotiate the return of Chinese nationals who had no right to remain in Australia. These negotiations resulted in return arrangements whereby China accepted back its nationals and led to the quick turnaround of Chinese boat arrivals. Those arrangements have been in place since 1999. Most of the boats sailed directly from China and were not organised from Indonesia.The last boat from China arrived in December 1999.

 Change in illegal migration pattern

 In 1999, however, a notable change in the pattern of illegal migration to Australia emerged, for which existing policy approaches were inadequate.

 First, between July 1999 and June 2001 there were 8,316 unauthorised boat arrivals compared with 4,114 in the period from 1989-90 to 1998-99.

 Second, there has been a distinct shift in the nationality profile of unauthorised boat arrivals from mostly Asian to mostly Middle Eastern in origin.

 Third, there has been an increase in the percentage of these arrivals presenting protection

 claims. For the past two years, more than 80 percent of unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia made protection visa applications, compared with 46 per cent for 1998-99.

 Finally, people smuggling is now behind a large proportion of unauthorised arrivals, with Indonesia now the key staging point for the movement of people from the Middle East and Afghanistan to Australia. The disposal of identity documentation before arrival in Australia and the high proportion of nationality and identity fraud prevents Australian officials from accessing material, which might help to verify the claims made by those arriving.

 Response to changed patterns

 In response to this dramatic change in the caseload and country of origin and transit, Minister Ruddock undertook a comprehensive itinerary of visits to the Middle East, Pakistan, Indonesia and Europe in order to engage the international community on this issue.

 Furthermore, in April 1999 the Prime Minister established a Coastal Surveillance Task Force to make recommendations on the strengthening of coastal surveillance procedures and systems. The Government adopted the Task Force's recommendation for a $124 million, four year program to strengthen Australia's capacity to detect and deter illegal arrivals, including:

 improved Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capabilities to detect pursue, intercept and search boats carrying unauthorised arrivals; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the introduction of harsher penalties, such as up to 20 years' jail and fines of up to $220,000, for people smugglers; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the placement of an additional seven immigration compliance officers and five airline liaison officers in key overseas missions; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 increased funding for technical assistance to transit countries, including training and equipment; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the development of an Overseas Information Campaign aimed at discouraging illegal air and boat arrivals. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Task Force also recommended that priority be given to concluding arrangements with source and transit countries and strengthening international cooperation in combating people smuggling.

 In late 1999, the Government established a second task force, the Unauthorised Arrivals in Australia Task Force, to look at the issues of international cooperation to combat irregular migration and people smuggling; measures to bolster the international protection framework; and steps to improve coordination and efficiency among Australian Government agencies.

 The primary outcome of this Task Force was the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated unauthorised arrivals strategy that addresses all points in the irregular migration chain, from source through first asylum and transit countries to destination countries. The three key elements of the strategy are:

 prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and secondary outflows from countries of first asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and intercept their clients en route to their destination, while ensuring that those in need of refugee protection are identified and assisted as early as is possible;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 developing appropriate reception arrangements for unauthorised arrivals who reach Australia, focusing on the early assessment of the refugee status of the individual, the prompt removal of those who are not refugees, or who are refugees but can access effective protection elsewhere.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government has adopted a whole-of-government approach to the management of irregular migration. This involves a high level of cooperation and coordination by all agencies involved in dealing with the problem including Immigration, Defence, Customs, AFP, Foreign Affairs and government intelligence agencies.

 1. Prevention

 In recognition that irregular migrants can be motivated by a range of a range of considerations, including humanitarian, protection and economic issues, the Government has sought to reduce the "push factors" from countries of origin and first asylum. Key actions under this strategy include:

 (a) Targeted aid funding

 Australia has provided substantial additional aid contributions to countries of origin and first asylum. In addition to the annual core contribution of $14.3 million to the UNHCR, the Government has committed almost $28 million since June 2000 for initiatives aimed at addressing the humanitarian needs of displaced Afghans and Iraqis refugees in the Middle East and South West Asia.

 In June 2000 $1.5 million was reallocated from Australia's 1999-2000 aid budget to the UNHCR 2000 Appeal for South-West Asia aimed at increasing the self-reliance of refugees in Iran and Pakistan;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In 2000-01, under a joint AusAID/DIMA program $9.5 million was allocated as follows:

 $3.0 million for the World Food Program's drought relief and food activities in Afghanistan; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $2.5 million to the UNHCR's South West Asia Appeal to assist countries of first asylum to receive and support asylum seekers from Afghanistan, and to strengthen their registration and refugee status determination programs;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $1.7 million to the United Nation's Children Fund (UNICEF) for development, and poverty eradication programs in Afghanistan; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $1.5 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for emergency programs in Afghanistan; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $0.8 million to the International Organisation for Migration to assist in stabilising the population in Afghanistan and to develop sustainable return and reintegration procedures.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In June 2001, DIMA provided an additional $2.5 million to the IOM for support to camps for Internally Displaced Persons in Afghanistan. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 (b) Information campaigns

 The Government has conducted domestic and international information campaigns designed to:

 (i) highlight the dangers of illegal migration and deter people smugglers; and

 (ii) explain the legal avenues of migration to Australia.

 The domestic information campaign uses ethnic community networks and media. Our international information campaign is conducted in source countries as well as in first asylum and transit countries to target smugglers and their potential customers.

 (c) Technical cooperation, capacity building and information exchange

 The Government has supported key countries of first asylum in combating irregular migration and people smuggling through cooperative approaches including the provision of technical assistance, and the exchange of intelligence and information.

 In May 2000, the Australian Government sponsored a workshop for Turkey's judges and prosecutors on refugee law issues. During 2000-01 Australian immigration officers presented successful document awareness and fraud detection training courses in Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and Syria.

 Australia has passed information to authorities in the Middle East on people smuggling activities that were targeting Australia. This has resulted in the arrest and deportation of a number of people. In January 2001, Syria signed a Record of Meeting with Australia, agreeing to the exchange of information relating to the activities and methods of people smugglers. In August, Malta signed a Memorandum of Understanding. Pakistan and Iran are currently considering agreements on the exchange of information.

 (d) International cooperation to enhance the integrity of the global protection system

 The Government has undertaken broad-ranging efforts aimed at increasing the international focus on the need to improve the operation of the international protection system. The Inter-Governmental Consultations process (IGC) has been one of our primary channels for engaging donor/destination countries on illegal migration and people smuggling issues.

 Australia took over as IGC Chair for the 12 months from November 2000 and focused on

 resolving problems in an integrated and comprehensive way, including:

 increased efforts to combat people smuggling; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» better targeted provision of aid and other forms of assistance; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 dealing with the Afghan and Iraqi caseloads; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the need to ensure that the provision of protection does not also provide an automatic migration outcome, which acts as incentive for movement. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The European Union (EU) is another important multilateral forum for engagement. Our engagement with the EU has been increasing steadily over the past 12 months, including through our participation in the EU's High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration (HLWG), which could be a valuable channel for cooperation to combat irregular migration from the Middle East.

 In addition, and in line with the review of United Nations' Treaty Bodies, the Government has pursued the reform of the UNHCR and its controlling body the Executive Committee (ExCom). The primary aim of this reform has been to seek to make ExCom more responsive to the needs of member states and more focused on responding to the challenges that irregular migration and people smuggling pose for the international system of protection.

 Activities with IOM include supporting a move towards recognition of the strategic role IOM can play as a forum for a wide range of countries with an interest in migration matters. IOM has the task of developing the framework of inter-governmental understandings and a consistent set of principles for all aspects of international migration in the lead up to the second Berne Initiative Conference in 2002-03.

 2. Disruption

 People smugglers have played a key role in the increase in irregular migration. In response, the Government initiated a range of actions, including:

 (a) Australian resources overseas

 DIMA has an extensive network of internationally posted Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs), Compliance officers and Liaison officers.

 ALOs investigate people smuggling, liaising with authorities in the host country, exchanging information, and providing training to assist in combating irregular migration. In the 2000-2001 Budget, the Government provided $3.1 million over four years was allocated to place additional ALOs in airports known to be key transit routes for irregular migrants.

 Compliance officers work closely with those host country agencies involved with border control and immigration law enforcement to counter and disrupt the activities of people smugglers. In the 2000-2001 Budget, the Government provided $12.4 million over four

 years was allocated to expand DIMA's compliance officer network (initially in Islamabad, Belgrade, Moscow, Amman, Tehran, Suva and Cairo) to combat document and identity fraud and people smuggling. Liaison officers have also been placed in Vietnam, Iran, Jordan and Pakistan.

 (b) Technical cooperation and capacity building

 The Government has undertaken a range of capacity building measures to assist other countries in our region to develop the systems and expertise necessary to deal with the problems of people smuggling and irregular migration.

 Minister Ruddock visited Papua New Guinea in October 2000 and a senior officials visit was undertaken in June 2001. These visits produced agreement on a range of joint cooperative activities to enhance PNG's border management capacity.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In East Timor, the Government has been discussing potential areas of cooperation with the interim Ministers and intends to continue to work with East Timor after the new government is constituted.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Document awareness and fraud detection training was provided in March 2000 to Indonesian immigration officials. Subsequently, a range of cooperative activities have been initiated, including joint training on: border management issues; character issues; bona fides assessment; entry strategies; and further document examination exchanges.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There have also been efforts to work with the Cambodian authorities to prevent Cambodia becoming a staging point for unauthorised arrivals to Australia. In June 2001, document fraud training was provided for over 200 Cambodian officials. In order to build on their recent cooperation, a delegation of Cambodian officials visited Australia in August to discuss areas of mutual interest, and possible areas of future cooperation. The Government is currently negotiating with Cambodia towards an MOU on combating irregular migration and people smuggling, which includes provision for the orderly return of migrants.

 Australia and Thailand recently signed a Joint Ministerial Statement (JMS) to combat irregular migration and people smuggling, which outlines ways in which the cooperation between the two countries can be enhanced. So far, Australia has provided technical and financial assistance for a five-week training program for over Immigration Bureau Police.

 In May 2001 Australian and Vietnamese officials met in Hanoi to discuss a range of technical cooperation initiatives, including the provision of border infrastructure such as computer assistance and document fraud training.

 (c) Intelligence gathering and exchange

 Intelligence information includes successfully identifying organisers of people smuggling, routes taken and the origin of bogus documents. Where possible, Australia passes back to the country of origin any information that it has collected on organisers of unauthorised arrivals to help local authorities with prosecutions.

 The Government has:

 worked closely with countries throughout the region to exchange information on the activities and methods of people smugglers; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 pursued a greater emphasis on information exchange and intelligence issues through various fora, including the Inter Governmental Asia Pacific Consultations on Refugees, Displaced Persons and Migrants (APC); and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 improved the national intelligence coordination effort against people smuggling and illegal migration, including the creation of several national intelligence coordination oversight committees.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 An example of the value of information exchange is the interception in Cambodia of an Australia-bound boat carrying 239 third country nationals who did not have permission to enter Australia, which resulted from intelligence exchanged between Indonesia, Cambodia and Australia.

 (d) Regional cooperation aimed at interception of irregular migrants

 Australia has supported the establishment of cooperative arrangements between the UNHCR and IOM and the Governments of Indonesia and Cambodia to intercept irregular migrants within their territories. The arrangements have resulted in:

 the interception of over 2,700 irregular migrants. Of that number approximately 990 are still in detention across Indonesia (mainly Iraqi and Afghan nationals). This number comprises people awaiting refugee determination as well as those who have been found not to be in need of protection;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 UNHCR assessing 480 third country nationals to be refugees. UNHCR is currently negotiating with donor countries for the resettlement of these people; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the removal by IOM of 180 third country nationals from Indonesia. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Detainees are accommodated in a number of transmigration centres or hotels across the Indonesian archipelago, which are not secure and a number have therefore left these arrangements.

 3. Reception

 The Government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that those who do reach Australia are dealt with efficiently, focussing on the early assessment of the status of the individual and removal of those immigrants who are not refugees or can access effective protection elsewhere. In addition, the Government has reduced the availability of additional benefits not required by the Refugees Convention to minimise the incentive for people to attempt illegal travel to Australia.

 (a) Detention arrangements

 The Government remains committed to the principle of mandatory detention for all persons without authority to be in Australia, implemented since 1992. The Government has established seven detention facilities around Australia, including two facilities at Curtin RAAF Base in Western Australia and Woomera in South Australia established in response to the sudden surge of arrivals 1999.

 From 7 August 2001, alternative detention arrangements have been trialed for 25 women and children who are living outside the Woomera IRPC in a cluster of four three-bedroom houses under close ACM supervision. Each has a family member remaining at Woomera, an application for asylum under consideration and poses neither character nor management risks.

 Major new detention facilities, announced in the 2000 Budget, are also planned for Darwin and Brisbane.

 On 23 August 2001, the Minister announced plans to increase contingency capacity for detaining unauthorised boat arrivals, including:

 a temporary reception and processing centre at HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin for unauthorised arrivals located off northern Australia. This facility will be an initial processing point, with detainees moved to other centres within a few days; ultimately it will be replaced by the permanent Darwin reception and detention centre announced in the 2000 Budget;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a detention facility at Singleton NSW at the existing Defence facility; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a facility at El Alamein near Port Augusta in South Australia, to become the primary contingency centre ahead of Singleton. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 (b) Processing capacity

 Since the sharp increase in late 1999 in the number of unauthorised arrivals, the Government has substantially re-engineered the processing of unauthorised arrivals without compromising the integrity of its assessment.

 80% of protection visa applications made by unauthorised boat arrivals in late 1999 received a decision within seven and a half months, this has been reduced to less than 14 weeks for applications lodged in late 2000.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Where applications are straightforward, decisions can now be made in as little as 2-3 weeks after lodgement. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 (c) Legislative changes

 A range of legislative amendments have been implemented to reduce the incentives of using Australian refugee law to achieve a migration outcome:

 On 1 July 1997, legislative amendments were introduced to remove the main incentive for people to use the system to prolong their stay in Australia. These âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 amendments provide access to work rights only for those people who have been in Australia for less than 45 days in the 12 months before they applied for a protection visa.

 On 20 October 1999, regulation changes came into effect that provide for unauthorised arrivals, who are recognised as requiring Australia's protection obligations to be granted a three-year temporary protection visa (TPV) instead of a permanent protection visa.

 The regulations were amended on 1 November 2000 to provide that those people who are immigration cleared on fraudulent documents, apply for a protection visa and are found to be owed protection obligations, only have access to a temporary protection visa in the first instance.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In December 1999, amendments were introduced to ensure that people who clearly have alternative protection avenues available to them will be prevented from making a valid protection visa application, unless there are public interest grounds for allowing them access to Australia's refugee determination system.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 On 28 August 2001, legislative amendments were introduced into parliament to restore the interpretation of the refugees convention to its original intention and to promote integrity in the protection visa process.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 (d) Negotiations on returns

 The Government has been working bilaterally for the past eighteen months to highlight to countries of origin and first asylum for irregular migrants the need to establish arrangements to return these people to their country of origin or to a country where they have previously had access to effective protection.

 The Minister has travelled extensively throughout the Middle East, South and South-East Asia, Europe and North America to engage with governments on these issues. The major focus to date has been on the primary caseloads in detention: Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians and Palestinians. These efforts will continue.

 Future actions

 The Government remains committed to the implementation of this strategy and will be taking a range of initiatives in the coming months to ensure that our national interests continue to be pursued:

 On 28 August 2001, the Minister announced the allocation of an additional $14.3 million to support the development of options aimed at resolving the situation of displaced Afghans.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government is now working to develop a coalition of countries interested in âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 supporting information campaigns in key countries. Such an approach will ensure the delivery of a single, coherent message with a greater geographic reach than equivalent bilateral campaigns.

 The Government will continue to seek to expand cooperation throughout the region on the interception and assessment of irregular migrants. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Ongoing cooperation with Indonesia will remain an essential element of the strategy. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The APC is the pre-eminent regional forum dealing with refugee and migration issues, including irregular migration and people smuggling. The 6th Plenary of the APC is to take place in Manila in November 2001. Issues for consideration include measures to provide the APC with a concrete operational structure to ensure its enhanced long-term effectiveness.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In October 2001 there will be a visit by Malaysian high-level officials including the Secretary-General of Home Affairs, the Director-General of Immigration, and senior members of the Royal Malaysian Police.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A working-level delegation of Cambodian officials is also expected in October, as a follow up to the August visit by senior officials. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In November 2001 a high level Vietnamese delegation consisting of Ministry of Public Security officials is expected to visit and discuss capacity building proposals. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»
