 Abstract: The  States  of  Europe  and  Australasia  share  democratic  institutions  and  

 political party traditions in many respects. They also share a concern with influxes of 

 immigrants  and  refugees  which  are  changing  the  ethnic  composition  of  what  were  

 previously  regarded  as  ‘nation  states’.  However  there  are  considerable  differences  

 between them in their political reaction to these changes. Some European states have 

 racist  or  fascist  traditions  which  have  been  entrenched  for  many  years  and  were  

 previously  directed  against  long-resident  minorities.  Others  have  been  relatively  

 homogenous and ethnic variety is a new experience. The immigration policies of the 

 states vary, with Australia and to a lesser extent New Zealand having a long history of 

 carefully planned and controlled intakes, designed to enhance the economy and avoid 

 ethnic conflict. Others can scarcely be said to have immigration policies at all and see 

 the  control  of  entry  largely  in  law  enforcement  terms.  This  variety  is  reflected  in  

 different  political  responses,  which  range  all  the  way  from  mass  support  for  anti-immigration  parties  at  the  ballot  box  to  anti-democratic  street  violence.  The  

 established  parties  may  attempt  to  pre-empt  new  movements  by  adopting  some  of  

 their  platform.  Resisting  this  temptation  is  a  particular  dilemma  for  parties  of  the  

 ‘Left’  which  rely  on  working  class  support.  Traditional  ‘left-right’  divisions  may  

 become  confused.  However  many of  the  new  movements  are  very unstable  and  this  

 may help  to  contain  their  impact,  especially if  the  established  parties  agree  to  resist  

 them.

 There  is  a  startling  contrast  between  the  Australian  and  the  European  experience  of  immigration  and  

 refugee flows and of ethnic relationships. While Australia has taken in over 600 000 permanent settlers 

 on a humanitarian and refugee basis since 1945, it has never been faced with an uncontrolled rush of 

 asylum seekers.  To prevent this from happening it instituted mandatory and irrevocable detention for 

 all  undocumented  arrivals  in  1991  and  developed  this  more  fully  in  the  late  1990s.  All  of  this  it  has  

 justified  to  the  UNHCR  as  legitimate  within  the  Convention  on  Refugees  of  1951.  The  rest  of  the  

 Australian immigration program is carefully controlled at a level of about 100 000 per annum, with net 

 migration at about 60 000 because of permanent departures. It is very improbable that many will enter 

 Australia  without  being  recorded  as  all  arrivals  need  a  valid  visa  to  avoid  detention  and  probable  

 deportation.  This  effective  control  does  not  prevent  public  hostility  and  even  panic  influencing  

 immigration  policy.   But  it  does  weaken  the  basis  for  anti-immigration  extremist  groups  when  

 compared  with  the  European  situation.   Moreover,  despite  a  long  history of  official  racism,  Australia  

 does not have a fascist tradition. Until the late 1940s it was overwhelmingly colonised from the British 

 Isles.   Those of British and Irish origin still constitute 75 per cent of the population and there are no  

 other ‘ethnic groups’ with more than four per cent, however generously defined. It has one of the oldest 

 two-party  systems  in  the  world  which  has  never  been  disrupted  by  war  or  revolution.  Lesser  parties  

 have  only  rarely  gained  10  per  cent  of  the  vote.  Only  one  of  these,  One  Nation,  has  been  centrally  

 concerned with immigration. It rapidly disintegrated after early success in 1998. 

 

 The European Contrast 

 

 Australia  has  no  land  borders  and  most  of  its  neighbours  do  not  adhere  to  the  UN  Convention  on  

 Refugees, although Australia may still judge them to be ‘safe havens’ nevertheless.  All members of the 

 European Union and  the Nordic Union subscribe to  the Convention,  to  the Schengen agreement (now 

 the  Amsterdam  Treaty)  effective  from  1995  and  the  Dublin  Convention  on  asylum  seekers  of  1990.  

 These  require  the  first  country  of  entry  to  take  responsibility  for  undocumented  arrivals  or  asylum  

 seekers.   Each  state  reserves  the  right  to  deal  with  such  immigrants  within  the  context  of  its  national  

 law  and  administration,  subject  to  the  UN  Convention  and  to  the  European  Convention  on  Human  

 Rights.   This  gives  considerable  scope  to  political  forces  opposed  to  immigration  and  refugees  to  

 influence  legislation  and  administration,.   There  is  a  wide  discrepancy  between  the  welfare  state  

 humanism of the Scandinavian states and the Netherlands, the reliance on the police of France or Italy 

 or  the  muddled  response  of  the  United  Kingdom.   Most  European  states  administer  immigration  

 through  their  law enforcement  agencies   (Ministry of  Justice,  Home  Office,  Ministry of  the  Interior  )  

 and  the  emphasis  is  often  on  deterrence  and  punishment.  However  none  of  them  have  adopted  the  

 mandatory and  irrevocable  detention  policy which  Australia  has  applied  to  all  unvisaed  arrivals  since  

 1991.  Most  of  them  allow an  ‘exceptional  right  to  remain’  for  many  who  are  not  strictly  Convention  

 refugees,  which  Australia  does  not.  Thus  the  flows  into  western  Europe  are  unpredictable  and  create  

 uncertainty and hostility which encourages opponents of all kinds of immigration and ethnic change(see

 Many  European  states  do  not  have  coherent  and  planned  immigration  programs  organised  through  a  

 national  ministry.    This  does  not  prevent  them  from  having  substantial  immigration  both  legal  and  

 illegal. Often the only legal route towards permanent settlement is to apply for asylum.  Two-thirds of 

 asylum applications in the world are made to European states, with Britain recently replacing Germany 

 as  the  main  target.   Germany  now  counts  12  per  cent  of  its  population  as  ‘foreign  born’  despite  

 maintaining  for  many  years  that  it  was  not  an  immigration  country.   In  the   past  decade  the  largest  

 numbers  of  asylum  seekers  in  Europe  have  come  from  Iraq,  Iran,  Afghanistan,  Turkey  and  former  

 Yugoslavia.  With  the  exception  of  Turkey  this  pattern  has  also  been  repeated  for  the   Australian  

 humanitarian  and  asylum  seeker  intakes,   although  earlier  influxes  were  mainly  from  Indochina  and  

 China. Orderly quotas of refugees are settled in Australia and New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, 

 Norway,  Denmark  and  Finland  by  arrangement  with  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees.   All  

 other  refugees  seek  asylum,  either  at  the  border  or  when  already  within  the  country.   The  former  

 frequently do not have a visa where required, while the latter do. To secure permanent residence they 

 5  JUPP, James  

 must  usually  satisfy  the  authorities  that  they  qualify  under  the  specific  requirements  of  the  1951  

 Convention and 1967 Protocol. 

 

 Immigration  might,  thus,  be  divided  into  legal  immigration  for  work  and  family  reunion;  refugee  

 immigration governed by the UN Convention;  asylum seekers (a majority of whom will not eventually 

 be  accepted  as  settlers);   and  those  who  have  managed  to  enter  a  country illegally or  to  remain  there  

 illegally.   While many extremists object to all forms of alien migration, it is the latter two categories 

 which  have  provoked  most  recent  political  reaction  and  hostility.   Between  1995  and  2000  Germany  

 greatly reduced its intake by changes to the law, but still received 827 000;  Britain received  308 000;  

 Sweden 65 000;  and Denmark 38 000.  The sudden escalation of British figures from 46 000 in 1998 to 

 76  000  in  2000  provoked  considerable  public  concern  and  media  agitation.  Over  the  same  six  years  

 Australia,  with  a  larger  population  than  Sweden  and  Denmark  combined,  received  60  000  asylum  

 applications.   This  also  provoked  a  major  political  reaction  and  drastic  changes  to  refugee  law  and  

 practice. 

 

 All the democracies of western Europe, like Australia and New Zealand, have increased ethnic variety 

 based on immigration.   But European variety is also often long-established and complex.   The history 

 of  most  nation  states  over  the  past  few  centuries  has  been  one  of  nationalising  previously  differing  

 ethnic  groups  within  their  boundaries,  which  some  groups  have  resisted  more  steadfastly  than  others.   

 Australia, too, in its repression of the Indigenous peoples, and New Zealand in its compromise with the 

 Maoris under the Waitangi treaty of 1840, have both preferred assimilation to the British-derived norm.  

 These  historic  developments  have  produced  a  kaleidoscope  of  ethnic,  religious  and  linguistic  variety,  

 which may be summarised as: 

 

 â¢ Relatively  monocultural  with  recent  changes  due  to  immigration:   Norway,  Sweden,  Denmark,  

 Portugal, Greece,  Austria, France, Germany, Australia 

 â¢ Officially  bilingual  or  multilingual:   United  Kingdom,  Ireland,  Belgium,  Finland,  Spain,  

 Switzerland, Italy,  New Zealand 

 â¢ Officially religiously diverse with a minority language; Netherlands. 

 

 This classification obscures much minor variety.  Greece, by treaty has had to recognise the Thracian 

 Turks;  Norway,  Sweden,  New  Zealand  and  Australia  have  indigenous  minorities;  Irish  is  a  minor  

 language  in  Ireland  although  officially  equal  with  English;  Germany  by  treaty  recognises  Schleswig  

 Danes;  Italy by treaty accepts  several  minor  languages  but  not  Italian  dialects;  France  refuses  to  give  

 official  status  to  its  large  Breton-speaking  minority;  and  so  on.   Norway,  Sweden,  Denmark,  Finland,  

 Australia and New Zealand are predominantly Protestant;  Portugal, Austria, France, Ireland, Belgium, 

 Spain and Italy are Catholic; Germany,  Switzerland  and the Netherlands are divided; while Greece is 

 Orthodox.  All have Jewish communities of varying sizes and Islamic populations of recent immigrant 

 origin which now usually outnumber the Jewish population. 

 

 6  JUPP, James  

 There was, then, plenty of scope for ethnic disputes and compromises before the more recent influx of 

 immigrant  workers,  refugees,  tourists,  students  and  illegal  entrants.  Anti-Semitism  has  a  European  

 history going back for  centuries  although this  has been muted  in Scandinavia  and  Australasia  and  has 

 little  relevance  to  Ireland.  Historically the  parties  of  the  ‘Left’  have  favoured  liberal,  multicultural  or  

 cosmopolitan policies, through this is not historically true in Australia.  The parties of the ‘Right’ have 

 emphasised national unity and homogeneity and the assimilation ( or in extreme cases the expulsion or 

 decimation) of ethnic minorities.  The French emphasis on common citizenship enabled the Jews to be 

 officially emancipated two centuries ago but offers little to those wishing to preserve Breton or Islamic 

 distinctiveness.    The  German  insistence  on  ‘blood-based’  citizenship  has  only  recently  been  relaxed  

 under a Social Democratic government and earlier spawned the horrendous imposition of racial purity 

 under  the  Nazis.   Less  ideologically  inclined  nations  have  all  defined  themselves  in  terms  of  core  

 cultures  and  founding  principles,  including  such  recently  established  societies  as  Australia.  These  

 nation-building  approaches  have  not  simply  been  ‘debates’  or  ‘discourses’  but  have  often  involved  

 severe repression of minorities. 

 

 Racist and Extremist Parties 

 

 Most  European  states  have  effective  parties  based  on  ethnic  or  religious  minorities  as  well  as  

 reactionary parties hostile to ethnic minorities and further immigration.   Britain has the former but not 

 the latter - Australia the latter but not the former.  Italy, Austria, Denmark and (briefly) the Netherlands, 

 have anti-immigration parties which are so influential that they have been admitted to government and 

 even  given  the  immigration  ministry.    France,  Germany,  Sweden,  Spain  have  kept  such  parties  from 

 office.  Britain,  Ireland,  Greece,  Australia  and  New  Zealand  have  pushed  them  to  the  margin.   This  

 variety often reflects conscious tactics rather than electoral support.    

 

 Whether  a  party  is  “extremist”  may  be  a  matter  of  taste.  This  is  usually  best  understood  within  the  

 context  of  the  established  organisations  and  ideologies  of  particular  societies.  For  the  purposes  of  

 discussion we might look for the following characteristics: 

 

 â¢ A  central  emphasis  on  race  and  ethnicity  in  the  party’s  appeal,  which  may  focus  on  recent  

 immigrants or have its origins in much older racist traditions; 

 â¢ Frequent involvement in street violence or even ‘terrorism’(bombings, killings, assassinations etc.); 

 â¢ Sympathy for previous racist movements and especially for Nazism and Fascism; 

 â¢ Alienation from the established parties and the system of parliamentary elections; 

 â¢ Glorification of the past of the dominant ethnic group; 

 â¢ Reliance on a charismatic leader 

 

 A combination of these usually characterises those parties which are marginal to electoral politics even 

 if  they  contest  elections.   While  such  parties  may  influence  the  political  system  they  are  usually  

 denounced  by  all  major  political  figures  relying  on  electoral  support.    Problems  of  definition  arise  

 7  JUPP, James  

 when  such  parties  suddenly  gain  mass  support  -  the  “Nazi  syndrome”  of   the  early  1930s  which  still  

 haunts  much  of  Europe.    Of  more  importance  is  the  difficulty  of  distinguishing  between  essentially  

 ‘racist’ parties and ‘populist’ parties.  One Nation  was quite clearly ‘populist’ and gained much of its 

 support on that basis. But it also got support from small activist groups which were much closer to the 

 European  pattern.    ‘Populism’  is  much  more  potent  electorally  than  ‘extremism’  and  thus  more  

 dangerous for harmonious ethnic relations and the acceptance of immigrants and refugees. 

 

 The recent electoral success or failure of relevant parties is indicated in Table Two.  The parties listed 

 may  be  broadly  conservative,  but  have  used  xenophobia  actively  in  recent  elections  to  enlarge  their  

 vote.   Some,  like  the  Dutch  Pim Fortuyn  List  may not  even  be  conservative  at  all  but  so  diverse  that  

 they rapidly disintegrate.   Some have entered governments, while others give their support.   These are 

 obviously  the  most  influential,  but  such  a  tactic  is  rarely  possible  in  systems  not  using  forms  of  

 proportional  representation.   The  anti-immigration  parties  have  generally  been  described  as  on  the  

 “Right” and have had most influence on voters and parties at that end of the political spectrum (which 

 is still recognised in Europe whatever may be true of the English-speaking countries).  But they are not 

 classically conservative nor are the electorally appealing ones neo-Nazi.  Major parties like Forza Italia, 

 the  Vlaams  Blok,  the  Swiss  SVP  or  even  the  Spanish  PP  are  not  exclusively  concerned  with  

 immigration  and  ethnicity  even  when  they  make  this  an  electoral  appeal.  Even  lesser  parties  such  as  

 One  Nation  tried  to  extend  their  program  into  areas  of  general  concern.   While  most  minor  parties  

 depend  on  charismatic  leaders,  these  are  not  always  from  the  same  mould  as  previous  fascists  or  

 conservatives. One Nation and the Danish Peoples Party were both led by women while Pim Fortuyn 

 was a homosexual and Winston Peters (NZ First) a Maori.  Most such parties have been populist and 

 try to draw support from all social sections by appealing to engrained prejudices and fears.

 in parliament. ‘Opposition’ means that the party is represented in parliament but that it does not support 

 the government. ‘Not applicable’ means that the party is not represented in parliament. ‘Recent vote’ is 

 for the latest lower house election (except for France). 

 

 

 The Impact on Policy 

 

 While  much  attention  has  been  focussed  on  specifically  anti-immigration  or  extreme  ‘Right’  parties,  

 most policy continues to  be  made  by major ruling parties.  These will, of course, take  account of any 

 significant rise in electoral support for the minor parties, as well as keeping an eye on public opinion 

 polls.   As  most  European  governments  are  coalitions  or  dependent  on  minority  support,  the  anti-immigration parties may exert considerably more direct influence than they do in the one or two party 

 governments of Britain, Australia, Ireland , Sweden or New Zealand.  They may even, as recently in the 

 Netherlands,  give  power  over  immigration  to  a  minority  party.   But  a  more  normal  reaction  in  all  

 systems  has  been  for  the  major  party  of  the  “Right”  to  pre-empt  nationalist  and  even  xenophobic  

 policies and thus hope to undermine the vote for minorities.  The Australian Liberals did this with much 

 success in 2001, whereas the British Conservatives failed miserably to do so in the same year.  In both 

 countries  the  major  party  of  the  “Left”   found  itself  adopting  policies  which  it  had  previously  

 denounced, as a way of maintaining its vote especially among the working class.   British Labour, like 

 many European parties, began to stress the need for national unity and social solidarity, especially after 

 the transfer of the Home Secretaryship from Jack Straw to David Blunkett in 2001.  Australian Labor 

 endorsed  most  of  the  policies  of  the  Coalition  government  arising  from  the  detention  and  transfer  of  

 asylum seekers in 2001 and the security measures adopted in response to the September attack on New 

 York.   Other  social  democratic  parties  were  less  willing  to  shift  but  some  suffered  electorally  as  a  

 result.  But  there  were  quite  different  results  in  superficially  similar  societies.  In  Austria  the  FPÃ  lost  

 half its  vote  in  2002  but  this  went  over  to  the  mainstream Peoples  Party (ÃVP)  with  whom they had  

 been in coalition.  In Switzerland the Swiss Peoples Party (SVP) supported a referendum, opposed by 

 all other parties, which would have made it almost impossible for asylum seekers to enter by land. This 

 was very narrowly defeated in November 2002. 

 9  JUPP, James  

 

 Policy shifts in the last years of the century may be summarised as: 

 â¢ Reasserting national culture, assimilation and loyalty 

 â¢ Tightening the control of asylum seekers 

 â¢ Seeking international co-operation in controlling movement 

 â¢ Reducing commitments to multiculturalism and humanitarianism 

 â¢ Attempting to institute more ‘rational’ immigration systems 

 

 These shifts have  not been incompatible with continued  assertion of human rights, racial equality and  

 the need to ‘integrate’ immigrant minorities and to cater for ‘indigenous’ languages and cultures.  Most 

 anti-immigration  parties  claim  not  to  be  racist.  Violent  racism  is  limited  to  the  extra-parliamentary  

 fringes  and  is  denounced  by  leaders  of  all  parliamentary  persuasions.   But  allegations  of  crime,  drug  

 trafficking  and  political  violence  are  often  used  in  mainstream  debates.   Christian  conservatives  may  

 join with secular liberals in criticising some aspects of Islam.   More recently the equation of Islam with 

 terrorism has made the lot of many Muslims difficult. However, it must also be said that some Muslim 

 activists, especially in Britain, France and Germany, have not made the life of their coreligionists any 

 easier by endorsing some terrorist actions. 

 

 Conclusions 

 

 For  those  who  like  neat  correlations,  there  is  little  in  the  recent  European  experience  of  resistance  to  

 immigration  which  gives  much  guidance.   The  two  major  recipients  of  asylum seekers,  Germany and  

 Britain, do  not have  strong racist parties.  While this may be  inhibited  in Germany by post-War anti-Nazi legislation and a cutoff level for parliamentary representation, there is a remarkable contrast with 

 the experience of neighbours such as conservative Austria or the liberal Netherlands and Denmark.  In 

 the United Kingdom neither the National Front nor the British National Party has ever won more than 

 the odd local government seat.  However both Britain and Germany have an unfortunate recent record 

 of racial violence - leading to deaths in both. These are not confined to recent immigrants and refugees 

 but often involve the local children of those who have been settled for many years. Those who seek for 

 socio-economic causes might note that the recent unemployment level in Germany has been more than 

 twice that in Britain. Those who prefer cultural-historical influences, might note that race rioting is as 

 prevalent in democratic Britain as it is among the heirs of Nazism or the DDR and that they, and social 

 democratic Sweden, have some of the most violent neo-Nazi groups. 

 

 For  the  rest  of  Europe  one  might  distinguish  between  states  where  anti-immigrant  parties  are  weak;  

 those where they are popular enough to make a claim on effective legislative representation; and those 

 where  they  have  been  strong  enough  to  join  governments  or  to  lend  them  necessary  support.   Anti-immigrant  parties  exist  throughout  Europe  and,  like  other  minorities,  have  legislative  representation  

 through proportional representation systems.  Thus a party like One Nation would have secured seats in 

 the  lower  house  if  it  had  contested  under  most  of  the  European  electoral  systems.   However,  the

 systems alone do not account for differing parliamentary influences. Ireland, with a relatively pure form 

 of PR, did not return the Immigration Reform Platform to the Dail.  Britain has only given very limited 

 support to the National Front and its successor, the British National Party.  Sweden saw off the Swedish 

 Democrats just as surely as Australia saw off One Nation, though New Zealand did give parliamentary 

 representation  to  New  Zealand  First  with  a  similar  level  of  voting  support.  New  Zealand  First  was  

 almost  the  only major  anti-immigration  party to  increase  its  support  into  the  21st  century,  though  this  

 has yet to be tested at the polls. 

 

 Australia  and  New  Zealand  found  themselves  in  the  unenviable  position  of  having  quite  strong  anti-immigrant  parties,  although  ones  with  a  very volatile  history.    One  Nation  secured  9  per  cent  of  the  

 national vote in 1998 and 23 per cent of the vote in Queensland in the same year. These are high by 

 European standards. While it might be argued that racism and xenophobia were not the sole appeal of 

 these  Australasian  parties,  the  same  could  be  said  of  some  European  parties  like  Forza  Italia.   One  

 Nation  was  frustrated  by  the  Australian  election  system,  while  NZ  First  benefited  from  different  

 arrangements close to those in most European states.  One Nation disintegrated rapidly, but so has the 

 Pim Fortuyn List in the Netherlands.    

 

 Despite all this variety, some generalisations might be made: 

 *     anti-immigrant and racist parties tend to rise quickly but to plateau or even decline; 

 â¢ anti-immigration parties lie on the ‘right’ of the spectrum and draw most of their supporters from 

 the ‘right’ parties; 

 â¢ they do,  however,  tend  to  appeal  to  the  less  educated,  the  provincial  and  those  often  not  directly 

 affected by immigration but subscribing to ‘traditional’ ideas of the nation; 

 â¢ street violence is often a sign of frustration when there is no  electorally effective  anti-immigrant 

 party; 

 â¢ the main party(ies) of the ‘right’ will co-opt much of the program of anti-immigrant parties 

 â¢ the parties of the ‘democratic left’ may respond by also co-opting or not resisting but are often at a 

 disadvantage because of the ambivalence of their members; 

 â¢ there will be a significant element ‘fighting racism’ but without much effective electoral following 

 as it, too, is seen as “extremist’; 

 â¢ the  overall  trend  is  to  tighten  immigration  and  refugee  control  with  public  approval,  partly  as  a  

 method of reducing anti-immigrant support. 

 

 The overall impact of parliamentary politics in Europe and Australia in the past five years has been to 

 domesticate  what  might  otherwise  have  developed  as  a  violent  and  destabilising  reaction  not  only  

 against  asylum seekers  but  also  against  many longer  established  ethnic  minorities.   Even  when  ethnic  

 politics has spawned violence, this has not been electorally acceptable.  Violence against minorities has 

 either  been  sporadic  and  unorganised  or  has  been  adopted  by parties  like  the  BNP  in  England  or  the  

 neo-Nazis  in  Germany.   In  Australia  most  of  the  violence  in  the  last  1990s  was  directed  against  One  

 Nation rather than by it. The major political parties have acknowledged a degree of ethnic variety even 

 11  JUPP, James  

 if  they  will  not  subscribe  to  multiculturalism  as  a  desirable  policy.   The  European  parties  have  also  

 accepted a need to allow free movement within the European Union and substantial tourist, student and 

 business  migration  globally.   Australia  and  New  Zealand  have  gone  further  in  operating  quite  

 substantial  programs  of  planned  immigration  designed  to  increase  their  workforces,  to  unite  families  

 and to prevent population decline.    All the states reviewed have maintained their commitment to the 

 Refugee  Convention  and  Protocol,  though  they  have  interpreted  this  very  differently.  The  impact  of  

 anti-immigration parties has generally been to restrict this commitment. However, they alone are not to 

 blame.  In  the  face  of  large  numbers  of  asylum  seekers  the  British  government  from  the  “Left”  has  

 modified  its previous liberalism without facing a serious minor party challenge, just as the Australian 

 party  of  the  “Right”  did  when  confronted  with  One  Nation.  Effective  minor  parties  certainly  sharpen  

 the ‘debate’ but they are not always the determining factor.    

 

 The ethnic situation in most of Europe  is currently more combustible than in Australasia. Even states 

 which have negligible electoral followings for extremist parties, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland or 

 Sweden, may have violent minorities. The aggravating role of the British National Party in the riots in 

 Lancashire in 2001 is a case in point. Both the BNP and the much more overtly neo-Nazi Combat 18 

 have  strong  links  with  European  neo-Nazi  groups  and  influence  on  the  racist  elements  in  soccer  and  

 rock music.  Similar groups in Denmark, Sweden and Germany are openly dedicated to violence rather 

 than to electoral politics.  Yet at the same time governments, churches and NGOs are actively endorsing 

 multicultural and integrative policies and denouncing racism. The European Union and individual states 

 guarantee minority language rights to a greater extent than ever before. 

 

  “Left”  groups  often  clash  violently  with  the  racist  extremists,  creating  an  atmosphere  of  instability  

 which  is  belied  by  election  figures.   The  tabloid  media  contributes  to  the  atmosphere  of  danger  and  

 violence  and  is  not  subject  to  any  effective  limitations,  unlike  broadcasting.   Police  forces  in  many  

 states are reluctant to report violent crimes and disturbances as ‘racially motivated’ even when this is 

 evidently the case.  The response of governments and  political parties to  this is to  tighten restrictions 

 and  to  demand  assimilation,  which  they  believe  will  appeal  to  the  majority.   Overall,  the  security  of  

 immigrants,  refugees  and  even  long-established  minorities  is  under  threat.  This  has  been  made  more  

 serious by the escalating fear of terrorism and the rising numbers of asylum seekers.   The Australian 

 government  has  responded  to  this  by  maintaining  its  draconian  regime  against  unauthorised  arrivals,  

 transferring  the  One  Nation  vote  to  itself  in  the  process.   It  has  met  with  little  resistance  from  the  

 official Opposition and has improved its electoral support nationally though not at the State level where 

 other  issues  predominate.   This  has  worked  to  the  advantage  of  the  national  government,  rather  than  

 encouraging specifically anti-immigration parties as in many European states.
