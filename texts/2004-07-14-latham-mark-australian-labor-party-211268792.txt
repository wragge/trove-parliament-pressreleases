 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   BENDIGO, VICTORIA    

 

 WEDNESDAY, 14 JULY 04  *E&OE **   

 Subjects:  American Alliance, Waste Dump in South Australia,  Federal Electorates of Bendigo, Ballarat, McEwen, Calder Highway,  Deer Park Bypass, Point Nepean, Temporary Protection Visas   

 

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]    

 LATHAM:  As you can understand and appreciate, I don’t comment on  the commentary but what I can say is that Labor strongly supports the American  Alliance. It was founded by a Labor Government in World War II. We’ve  supported it ever since and we’ll support it in the future. The fact that Kim  Beazley has come back to our front bench - he is someone who is widely  respected and admired and it signifies that he was one of the decision makers in  the 80s and 90s, when the Alliance was at its very best, and we’ll get it back to 

 its best when Labor is next in Government. That’s the reality of our relationship  with the United States and we’ll keep that up for the future.   

 JOURNALIST:  The Federal Government has decided against the nuclear  radioactive waste dump in South Australia. Is this a sign [inaudible] election  policies in South Australia?    

 LATHAM:  It is a sign that there is an election coming up - and I think the  Government is saying this with an eye to the federal election - but they are likely  to reverse their decision once the election is out of the way. Let’s be honest 

 about this: the Howard Government, for eight years, has been pursuing a  nuclear waste dump in South Australia. They have been funding legal cases.  They’ve been dogged in their determination to get the dump into South  Australia. I think this announcement has been made just for the Federal election  and it is another example of Mr Howard saying one thing before the election and  getting ready to reverse his decision as soon as the election is out of the way. A  Government that has been pursuing a dump for eight years, they are only saying  this because an election is coming up and really they can’t be believed.     

 JOURNALIST:  With all the waste, is that for the States to look after, as the  PM has said?   

 LATHAM:  My understanding is the States are just responsible for 10 per  cent of the waste that’s generated in Australia. The other 90 per cent is the  national responsibility and the Howard Government has been dogged for eight  years in trying to get the waste dump into South Australia. They can’t be  believed, a month before a federal election, in saying that after all that time  they’ve changed their mind. There are so many examples where the Prime  Minister says one thing before the election and then goes down the same old  path once the election is out of the way. I see this as another example of  decisions, announcements that are made just for the election that really can’t be  believed.   

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible] Mike Rann saying he’s really been playing politics.  What is your response to that?   

 LATHAM:  I think it is the Howard Government that is engaged in politics  a month prior to a federal election. For eight years they have been trying to get  the dump into South Australia and the only reason they are saying this today is  because there is an election coming up. People in South Australia would know  that they will be back to their old form quick as a flash. As soon as the election is  out of the way, they will be trying, as they have been for eight years, to get that  dump into South Australia.    

 JOURNALIST:  Isn’t this [inaudible] the Coalition’s three marginal seats in  South Australia?   

 LATHAM:  I’m not getting into that sort of commentary. I just know that  they want the dump in South Australia and Mr Howard is only saying this  because there is an election coming up.   

 JOURNALIST:  Where would Labor put all of that waste?    

 LATHAM:  What we want to do is get the process right. We’ve  consistently said that unless you’ve got the process right, the consultation right -  that you are working with the State governments instead of against them - you’ll  never get a decent outcome so we’ve said we will start the process again. We  wouldn’t be doing it in South Australia but we would recommence the process  and, without the quality process, you’ll never get quality decision making.   

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Latham, just on [inaudible] comments again, do you see  that as an attempt by the United States to try and [inaudible] the relationship  with Labor? 

 

 LATHAM:  Labor has always had a very strong relationship with the  United States. We founded the American Alliance during World War II. We’ve  kept it strong over the years. In the 80s and 90s, when we had Labor  governments, we were able to enhance the relationship - although, from time to  time, there were differences of opinion. We believe in a robust and strong  American relationship and we’ll have that again when we are next in  Government.   

 JOURNALIST:  You are visiting three rural electorates - yesterday and today.  How do you think Labor is travelling in those seats?    

 LATHAM:  What I know is that people are very concerned about the run  down in services. Local people have said to me, both in McEwen and now  Bendigo, they are worried about the run down in health and education services,  the lack of opportunity for young people. We’ve been putting policies out there  to try and overcome those deficiencies. Whether it is our Youth Guarantee or our  mentoring program or the many initiatives we’ve got in health and education,  these are the things that build quality of life in regional Australia and we’ll be  very determined to implement all those policies when in Government to build up  quality of life in centres like Bendigo so that you keep the people who live here  now and attract new investment, new skills and new people in the future.   

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible] in Bendigo?   

 LATHAM:  We’ve got very good effective local members who work hard  on all the issues. In a democracy we rely on the good trust and judgment of the  Australian people but if they want to back in hard working local members - and 

 in Bendigo Steve Gibbons is a tremendous MP. We can’t get out of Canberra  alive unless you back him on the Calder Highway, which is what we are doing.  The same with Catherine King, who has been a great advocate in Ballarat on her  road and project of importance - the Deer Park Bypass - which, again, we are 

 supporting. So they’ve had a big influence on Labor policy to let us know that we  need the right policies and projects to improve, even further, quality of life in  Bendigo and Ballarat.   

 JOURNALIST:  John Howard hasn’t been in Ballarat or Bendigo for some  years now. Do you think it is a sign that perhaps the Coalition has given up on  winning the central Victorian belt?    

 LATHAM:  You’ll have to ask Mr Howard about that. If he gives up then  it’s about time!     

 JOURNALIST:  What about the [inaudible] that is a marginal of about  [inaudible]    

 LATHAM:  Yes, I was there yesterday in Seymour, and the same  message from all the service providers: they need more help - more help to deal  with youth unemployment, more help to create education and health  opportunities and it was good to see that Labor’s policy was relevant, effective,  and trying to help the community with the concerns they’ve got.   

 JOURNALIST:  What about McEwen?    

 LATHAM:  That’s up to the people, you see. I’m an advocate for policy. It  is the people who decide who holds the seat of McEwen. We held it prior to 1996  and, obviously, we are working hard to try and regain the trust and confidence  of those local communities.    

 JOURNALIST:  Are you concerned about how the handling of Point Nepean  will actually play out in McEwen?   

 LATHAM:  Well, we know it is playing out very badly in Flinders, where it  has been something of a shemozzle, the handling of Point Nepean. It should  have come over as a national park and let’s get on with the preservation there  instead of all the silly games and maladministration that Fran Bailey has been  involved in.   

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible] do you have any detail of the issue?   

 LATHAM:  What is the nature of that - I’m happy to -   

 JOURNALIST:  In relation to giving them more opportunities to become  permanent residents.    

 LATHAM:  That is something the Government should try and overcome.  If people on long-term TPVs, who are contributing to regional economies and  they’re appreciated, they’re good citizens, they’re good workers, then we’ve got  to ensure that they’ve got the opportunity to continue that in the future on a  permanent basis. Hopefully, the Government can address those farmer concerns.  They’re certainly addressed in Labor policy. If the Government hasn’t yet got it  right then, with this back flip on TPVs, they should do the full Monty and adopt  the full Labor approach.   

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible] devil in the detail?   

 LATHAM:  That’s the Howard Government for you; there is always devil  in the detail but they should adopt the full Labor policy on TPVs, and that’s  something that we could give to regional Australia - the communities that have  benefited from the hard working TPV holders. If they are doing the right thing in  regional Australia, we should give them the opportunity to continue their service  to the local economy and their service to good Australian citizenship. Thank you,  very much.
