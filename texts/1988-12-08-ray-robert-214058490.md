 1989-90 MIGRATION PROGRAM TO REMAIN AT 140,000

 Australia's migration program for 1989-90 will remain at the  current year's level of 140,000.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Robert Ray said this program level struck a  good balance between family, economic and humanitarian  needs.

 He said the that without the benefit of more detailed  research, Government was not. prepared to accept the view  that the level should be increased for each of the next  three years.

 "The 140,000 figure has been set following wide-ranging  consultations with state governments, industry, community  and ethnic groups and individuals," the Minister said.

 "We have assessed all the issues which have an impact on the  size and nature of the program and have set an optimum  program figure," Senator Ray said.

 "This figure does not include an expected inflow of New  Zealand citizens.  Nor does it take into account permanent  departures of Australian residents in 1989/90," the Minister  said.

 The intake would comprise:

 Family migration - immediate family 41 000

 - extended family 30 000

 71 000

 Economic migration 54 000

 - Business Migration Program 10 000 - Tripartite negotiated arrangements  and other employer nominations 11 000 - Special talents 500

 - Independent 23 500

 - Occupational Shares System 9 000

 Humanitarian migration 12 500 14 000

 Senator Ray said"the—present migration program  would be realigned, and renamed in these broad  (see separate press statements for further descriptions).

 The Minister said however that the end result would be very  similar to that expected in the current year,in terms of the  types of migrants coming to Australia.

 In other words, there would be no significant shift in the  balance of the program between family, economic and  humanitarian migrants next year.

 The Minister said the "Special eligibility" category  facilitated the entry of eligible former Australian citizens  and residents, and of a few people other than family members  granted resident status for compassionate reasons.

 In another change which would affect small numbers of  people, the existing provisions for self-supporting retirees  would be abolished and replaced with extended temporary  entry provisions.

 This was to avoid unfair demands on Australia's health and  social welfare system by people who had not contributed to  the system during their working life. (See separate  statement.)

 Senator Ray said the current Grant of Resident Status (GORS)  provisions would be maintained with some administrative  changes. (See separate statement).
