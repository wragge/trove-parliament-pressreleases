 1983/84 'IMMIGRATION PROGRAM

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West, today announced details of the Government's  1983/84 immigration program.

 The main·feature is that an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 visas  will be issued to migrants, a slight reduction on the present  financial year intake.

 This will be done with a new mix of migration. Greater  emphasis is to be placed on'family re-unions and refugees. The’  Government is cutting back in 'the employment related  aieas including Occupations in Demand, and the Employer  Nomination Scheme.

 Mr West told Parliament that the Government's aim was to  achieve the right combination of costs and benefits to  the community in settling migration parameters.

 "We have tried to balance the various competing and ·   conflicting interests," he said. '

 "We recognise that the economy is in recession but also  recognise that we have humanitarian obligations to people  far worse off than us." Mr West also pointed out that  while the present Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangements â    between Australia and New Zealand would remain, the 

 situation would continue to be closely monitored. This  would ensure the arrangements continued to be in  Australia's interests.

 "Suspension of the arrangements would have serious ·   implications for trade, foreign policy and other national  interests and would be inconsistent with the recently  signed Closer Economic Relations Agreement," said Mr West.

 Mr West pointed out to the Parliament that the Government's  1983/84 program was a ceiling.

 "Within this ceiling, it will maintain a strong commitment  to the re-union of close family members of Australian  citizens and residents," he said.

 It is anticipated that between 51,000 and 57,000 migrants  would be approved in the family migration category.

 The points system under which some family and other migrants  are selected has been restructured to make the system more  equitable. Mr West told the Parliament' that points for  English language and occupational demand have been dropped  for family selection purposes but points for arranged " -employment will continue to operate.  .

 The Government's commitment to a refugee policy is based on  humanitarian objectives.

 In 1983/84 20,000 places will be made available under the  Refugee and Special Humanitarian Program. Substantial  programs would be maintained for Indo-Chinese and East  European refugees but the Government will look to a wider  range of sources for its humanitarian intake.

 "It is unacceptable for instance that only 100 out of 17.000 in 1982/83 should be from Central and South America,   when there are already 300,000 refugees in Central America  alone," said Mr West.

 "Persons from totalitarian regimes in that part of the world,t,;  are not receiving adequate representation in Australia's  humanitarian programs."

 "The remainder of the program will consist of some 3,000  to 6,000 persons in the Occupations in Demand sub-category,-2.000 to 3,000 under the Employer Nomination Scheme,  2,000  under the Business Migration Program, and about 1,000 in 

 each of the Independent and Special Eligibility Categories,   said Mr West.

 Mr West said that in reaching decisions on labour shortage  migration, the Government believed that less reliance should  be placed on the migration program as a source of skilled  workers. .

 "The Goxfernment will develop a manpower planning approach  to ensure that economic recovery is not held back by skilled  labour shortages,  and conversely that immigration does not  become an alternative to Australian training and re-training  programs," he said.

 The Business Migration Program will continue to be promoted.
