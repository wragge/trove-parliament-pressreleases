 REGIONAL CONSULTATIONS ON ILLEGAL MIGRATION

 The illegal mass movement of people is emerging as one of the  world's most pressing problems, the Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus said today.

 Opening the Regional Consultations on Illegal Migration at  Canberra's Lakeside Hotel, Senator Bolkus said that more than  100 million people were on the move throughout the world, both  legally and illegally.

 "While the regular temporary movement of people for business and  tourism is a welcome development for Governemnts, illegal  migration undermines their sovereign rights to determine who can  enter and remain in their territory, and brings with it security 

 and health problems as well as creating social tensions in the  community," Senator Bolkus said.

 "The methods and routes of clandestine travel are diverse and  involve varying degrees of organisation and sophistication.

 "One of the aims of the Regional Consultations is to exchange  information and increase the level of knowledge amongst 

 participants of the ways in which illegal migration operates.

 Seventeen countries from throughout the region, the United  Nations High Commission for Refugees and the International  Organisation for Migration are represented at the two-day 

 consultations, which are being hosted by the Australian 

 Government.

 They are:  Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, China (PRC), Hong Kong,  Indonesia, Japan Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,  the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, UK, USA, and Vietnam.

 Senator Bolkus leaves today for a two-week official visit to  Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, where illegal migration  will be one of a range of immigration and humanitarian issues for  discussion.
