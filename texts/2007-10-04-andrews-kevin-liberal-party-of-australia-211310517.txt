 Statement of Refugee and Humanitarian Intake 2007-08   

 Since 1945, Australia has welcomed more than 6.6 million people from all over the world,  including around 675 000 refugee and humanitarian arrivals.     

 In 2007, we are a thriving country of 21 million people, with more than 40 per cent of our  population either first-generation migrants or their children.   

 Our great achievement in Australia has been to balance diversity and integration.    

 Community support and confidence in our immigration program is essential if we are to  continue our proud history of being a peaceful and cohesive nation.    

 Each year, the Australian government sets the size and composition of the immigration  program, including the refugee and humanitarian component.   

 In deciding the composition of our refugee and humanitarian policy we consider who is in the  greatest need of our assistance. Various groups are consulted, including representatives of non  - government refugee organisations and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees  (UNHCR).    

 There are an estimated 20 million refugees globally and in absolute numbers, Australia takes  more refugees than any country other than the United States. On a per capita basis, we are the  most generous country in the world. Outside of Australia, Canada and the United States, only  seven other nations have a similar resettlement program. Between them, these seven countries  take only about one-third of the number that Australia does. In other words, Australia’s  refugee program is larger than the whole of Europe’s.   

 The Australian Government’s responsibility for newly arrived refuges does not simply end  once they arrive in Australia.  It also must consider and monitor how well those who have  recently arrived are integrating into the community.  

 

 The Government has been aware that many refugees from parts of Africa have had difficulties  settling in Australia. Many are young men in their teens and early twenties, most of these  have low levels of education. Most have come from war and conflict including torture. Many  have lived in refugee camps for up to and over a decade and all have come from a vastly  different culture.    

 The unique challenges of this group have long been recognised and acknowledged. It is not  surprising that some young men, without adequate English, and with low levels of education  who drop out of school without a job, pose more challenges for us. 

 

 This year I have received advice from my department and from community organisations  across Australia.  It has been conveyed to me that recent refugee and humanitarian arrivals  from the region of Africa are continuing to experience difficulty in successfully settling in  Australia, and the result is high levels of community concern.    

 Each month my department compiles a concise community report for me which contains  feedback from various ethnic organisations about events in their local community.    

 The following is a summary of material provided to my Department:   

 â¢ Concerns about the establishment of race based gangs.   

 â¢ Reports of altercations between African groups in nightclubs and at community  functions.     

 â¢ Disagreements amongst prominent African community organisations over accusations  that some are receiving favoured treatment in accessing community services   

 â¢ Tensions have arisen between some African families, involving conflict and assault.     

 â¢ Concern among some community leaders as to the increase in crime among African  youth.     

 â¢ Reports of a developing trend of young African males congregating in parks at night,  often to consume alcohol.    

 Since 2001, the largest group of refugees and humanitarian entrants have been from Africa.  This reflects our response to the conflict on that continent, especially in the Horn of Africa.  The proportion reached 70 per cent of our total intake in 2003-4 and 2004-5.   

 Data on the pre-migration experiences of humanitarian entrants has indicated that there was a  significant increase in the levels of disadvantage.  For example, of entrants arriving in 2005-06:   

 - average schooling was 4.3 years compared to 7 years in 2002-03;  - 40% had spent time in a refugee camp compared to 15% in 2002-03;  - 11% rated their reading ability as good or very good, compared to 27% in 2002-03; 

 - 80% required an interpreter compared to 64% in 2002-03; and  - 67% were aged under 25 compared to 58% in 2002-03.   

 In recognising the potentially disparate needs of recently arrived humanitarian entrants it was  determined that a whole of government strategy was required.  For example, a single  humanitarian entrant may require English Language assistance, income support, vocational  training, support to develop life skills, family relationship counselling, health services and  education about legal responsibilities. 

 

 Following an examination of settlement services, an additional $210 million was allocated in  this year’s budget to enhance these programs. This is in addition to the $250 million a year the  Australian Government normally spends on settlement related services. 

 

 This extra money is especially needed to enable young people to speak adequate English, to  assist victims of torture and trauma and to simply teach people the basic essentials needed to  manage from week to week. 

 

 The Government is also changing the sponsorship arrangements for humanitarian entrants  following observations that individuals struggling to adjust in Australia are not necessarily the  best placed to be sponsoring other people. Instead, community organisations will be taking up  this role.   

 Secondly, the Government decided to reduce the proportion of refugees from Africa to 30 per  cent of the 13,000 quota for this year. Applications can take months and years to process,  given the need for health and other checks. Most of the 30 per cent from Africa will come  from those applications already in the system.   

 Next year, the government will once again examine the size and composition again, as it does  each year.  This approach makes sense and it allows for flexibility in being able to respond  appropriately to any problems that may arise with the program. 

 

 The Labor Party holds the opposite view and has criticised the Government for setting  refugees targets on a year by year basis.  Labor has committed to setting long term targets,  which would be inflexible and provide no room to respond readily to changing conditions and  circumstances.   

 The critics who shout ‘racism’ are bereft of real arguments. Having a more equal focus across  Africa, the Middle East and Asia hardly constitutes ‘racism’.   

 Australia has the right to ensure that those who come here are integrating into a socially  cohesive community.  From early 2008, the capacity of migrants to integrate into the  Australian community will be formally assessed through an interview.  Those who are  assessed as representing an unacceptable integration challenge will be refused permission to  migrate to Australia. 

 

 The government’s approach to modulating the program, providing more services and  monitoring the progress will best serve the Australian people, including those who we seek to  assist by bringing here.   

 For Australia’s immigration program to be successful, it needs the support and acceptance of  the Australian community.  This will only be achieved if they have confidence in the integrity  of the program.  Responding to issues where there are concerns about the benefits of certain  aspects of the program is not only justified, it also protects and reinforces the integrity of  Australia’s overall immigration program.
