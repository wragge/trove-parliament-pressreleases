 JOE HOCKEY:  I nearly dropped a barbell on my foot at the gym this morning when I heard Wayne Swan say - in an  answer to a question from Fran Kelly on whether the government will increase taxes - ‘well we have  found  the  savings  and  we  will  find  further  savings’.  When  you  look  at  the  Labor  Government’s   definition of savings, at the last Budget, and all the Budgets before, half their so called ‘savings’ are  actually  tax  increases.  The  truth  must  out.  The  Labor  Party  cannot  keep  spending  like  there  is  no   tomorrow, they actually need to be upfront before the election with the Australian people about what  taxes they are going to increase to pay for their wild spending spree. According to Julia Gillard there  is money for everyone, and there is plenty of it. But what we now know from Martin Parkinson and  Ken Henry is that the money is not there unless the government is actually going to increase taxes to  pay  for  its  big  spending  promises  on  schools,  on  submarines,  on  a  National  Disability  Insurance   Scheme - tens of billions of dollars, blow outs on asylum seeker policy. This is a Labor Government  that is not coming clean with tax increases. We are not going to let them get to the next election, and  then during the course of the next election, promise there will never be a carbon tax, or promise there  will never be capital gains tax on the family home. We want them to come clean now. They can’t  keep spending the way they are. 

 JOURNALIST:

 Wayne Swan is insisting there is a $70 billion black hole in Coalition policies. Can you rule out any  tax increases or levy increases when you come to power? 

 JOE HOCKEY:

 The thing about Wayne Swan is every time he is asked a question about his Budget as Treasurer, he  turns onto us. He turns onto us! I have said it before, I will say it again, there is no $70 billion hole.  The only hole is in Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan’s credibility and that is because they keep telling  lies.  They  might  throw  out  Tony  Abbott  and  Joe  Hockey  and  Peter  Dutton  and  others,  but   unfortunately, sadly, we have a Prime Minister and we have a Treasurer that lie. They lied before the  last election saying there would be no carbon tax. They are telling lies now and it is really regrettable  to have to say that but it is the truth and if they were my children they would be on the naughty step  on a regular basis.

 JOURNALIST:

 I think the question was though ‘can you rule out any tax increases or cuts in spending?’ 

 JOE HOCKEY:

 No, we are going to cut spending.

 Can you rule out tax increases?

 JOE HOCKEY:

 We  have  already  said  that  we  are  going  to  have  a  paid  parental  leave  levy  but  we  are  going  to   decrease company tax. The problem is Labor when they talk about tax increases it is new taxes, and  then  they  refer  to  the  mining  tax.  The  MRRT  represents  less  than  1%  of  Federal  Government   revenue,  less  than  1%.  So  let’s  be  fair  dinkum  here,  the  Government  is  true  to  form.  It  is  big   spending, big taxing, and that is the way they do it, in that order. They spend big then they tax big. 

 Spend big then tax big.

 JOE HOCKEY

 Well  we  don’t  know  when  the  next  election  is.  So  on  today’s  numbers,  yes,  of  course.  We  have   found  all  our  savings  and  we  have  got  our  policies,  we  are  ready  to  roll  if  an  election  is  called   tomorrow.

 JOURNALIST:

 When are we going to see those policies?

 JOE HOCKEY:

 You tell me when the election is on. 

 JOURNALIST:

 Are you going to put them out beforehand?

 JOE HOCKEY:

 Yes, before the election. That is the best time to put out policies. Thank you.
