 Australia makes first contribution to Afghan returnee program

 Australia would provide $3.2 million to assist Afghan refugees In Pakistan  and returnees to Afghanistan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,  Senator Gareth Evans, announced today.

 Of this, $2 million represents the first component of Australia's pledge  made in 1988 to provide $20 million over three years to assist a special  United Nations program to resettle Afghan refugees in their own country.  Australia's contribution is in response to a UN $US1.2 billion appeal last year  for the return of some 5.5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.

 Senator Evans said Australia's contribution would be used by various UN and  international agencies to provide short term relief and recovery assistance.  The bulk of the funds would be used to provide Australian wheat to the  returnees. Most of the $2 million would be channelled through the UN 

 Coordinator’s office for allocation to the agencies to Implement their relief  programs.

 The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), UN World Food  Programme (WFP), International Committee of the Red Cross and the  Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief will all receive support from  Australia to implement their programs to support the mass return of Afghan 

 refugees. Funds have also been made available, should they be required, to  assist In training Afghan people to deactivate land mines.

 "Australia is pleased to be able to provide support to the UN and other  agencies involved in one of the most complex recovery programs ever  undertaken," Senator Evans said.

 Further funding is expected to be allocated to Australian voluntary agencies  in the coming months.

 The balance of $1.2 million would be provided to WFP as part Australia's  ongoing assistance to help feed approximately three million Afghan refugees  in Pakistan. ,

 Senator Evans said the grant would cover the costs of internal transport,  storage and handling charges for the provision of Australia's annual  20 000 metric tonne wheat shipment to Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

 Australia's support for Afghan refugees and returnees forms part of the  Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
