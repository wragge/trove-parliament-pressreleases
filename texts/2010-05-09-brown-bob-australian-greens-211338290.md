  Greens attack Abbott's xenophobic action plan 

 

 Sunday 9th May 2010, 1:10pm 

 Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown says Liberal Party Leader Tony Abbott's new election campaign 

 television advertisement is xenophobic. 

 The advertisement promises action on ‘illegals', singling out the nations of Sri Lanka, Indonesia, 

 Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. 

 "This campaign is xenophobic," said Senator Brown. 

 "It's a sign of things to come in the election campaign from the Coalition.  

 "It is not illegal for people to seek asylum. 

 "Mr Abbott is suggesting that Australia renege on its obligations under the UN convention on refugees. 

 "4200 people sought asylum in Australia last year and 90% were accepted as legal refugees. 

 "Australia accepts only 1.6% of the world's refugees, and they represent only 7% of Australia's immigration 

 intake. 

 "The vast majority of "illegal" immigrants in Australia are the 50,000 visa over-stayers, who largely come 

 from China, Malaysia and the United Kingdom. 

 "And to put this perspective, 30 000 Kiwis are allowed to - rightly - come and go as they please. 

 Senator Brown also called on the Federal Government to hold early negotiations with the Greens regarding 

 the federal budget. 

 "As always the Greens will be looking to improve the Government's legislation to get better outcomes for 

 the community. 

 "Key areas will be: the $1.7 billion going to miners in fuel tax credits, and also the Fringe Benefits Tax 

 concession on company cars, which encourages people to drive more to get tax breaks. 

 "This money should go to fast efficient public transport including the Greens proposed study into High 

 Speed Rail."
