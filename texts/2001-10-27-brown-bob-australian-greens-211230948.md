 Australian Greens National Campaign Launch Greens Launch Campaign for 'Generous, Humane Australia'

 Glowing from poll analysis which shows the Greens may win 5 Senate seats, Greens Senator Bob Brown today launched the Greens national campaign in Sydney.

 Senator Brown rebuked the Howard/Beazley attitude to asylum seekers and the war in Afghanistan as failing Australia and called the Greens platform positive, spirited and aimed at building Australia's reputation as an independent, generous problem-solving nation renowned for its humanity.

 Platform highlights include:

 Afghanistan â¢ A one month moratorium in Afghanistan to allow international aid to the million civilians at risk â¢ A ban on cluster bombing: Australian to help clear bombs â¢ A new "Marshall plan" of international aid to the region

 Asylum seekers â¢ A multi-party fact finding mission to asses the refugee crisis in Pakistan and Indonesia â¢ Australia to accept the 450 recognised refugees now in Indonesia

 Environment â¢ Nominate WA's Ningaloo Reef and coast range and the Tarkine in Tasmania (Australia's largest temperate rainforest) for World Heritage listing â¢ German style national deposit laws on containers including the 6 million plastic bags

 consumed in Australia annually â¢ ending logging of old growth forests across Australia

 Democracy â¢ Get rid of corporate donations which reinforce the power of old entrenched industries â¢ Make corporate welfare accountable, in the same way as social welfare â¢ Shift the subsidies from the old resource extraction industries to the new clean, green

 job rich enterprises based on environmental technologies

 GST assistance for small business and community groups -- $2 billion pa â¢ Allow organisations with a turnover of less than $2 million per annum to keep the first $1000 of GST collected each year as partial recompense for their work as unpaid tax collectors

 â¢ This will help the 95% of GST registered businesses and community groups which have a turnover under $2 million per annum

 â¢ Funded by abolishing the concessional tax treatment of company cars, tightening the fringe benefits tax and stemming tax avoidance

 Valuing the arts -- $10 million pa â¢ $10 million per annum initially to introduce the European scheme of royalties for artists each time a work is sold â¢ introduce a system equivalent to Public Lending Rights for authors so an annual

 payment is made to artists whose work is displayed in public spaces

 Rejuvenate the ABC â¢ Restore funding to 1985/86 levels â¢ Restore the independence of the Board by adopting the British system of arms-length appointments by an independent commission:  two staff representatives, Chairman to

 be elected by the Board
