 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 04 005 28 January 2004 

 Further Humanitarian Assistance to the Palestinian  Territories 

 I have announced a further Australian contribution of $3 million in humanitarian assistance to  refugees in the Palestinian territories. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will  receive $2 million and $1 million will be allocated to the International Committee of the Red  Cross.

 These contributions are part of the continuing humanitarian and development assistance that  Australia provides to the Palestinian people. They bring total estimated aid flows to the  Palestinian people in 2003-2004 to $11 million.

 Australia's contributions will be covered by an agreement between Australia and UNRWA  which I signed with the Commissioner General of UNRWA, Mr Peter Hansen.

 Funding through UNRWA will go towards food aid, employment generation, shelter  reconstruction and emergency health and education. UNRWA currently provides food aid to  more than one million refugees in the Palestinian Territories. The agency has a highly effective  field presence and the necessary infrastructure to carry out such work.

 I am pleased that previous Australian funding was used by UNRWA in emergency renovation  work at the Aida Girls' School in Bethlehem, which I saw during my visit.

 Our assistance to the ICRC will help it promote respect for International Humanitarian Law on  both sides of the conflict.

 Further assistance in the areas of agriculture and rural development could be made available  should there be genuine progress towards implementing the 'Roadmap'. Agriculture, which  provides an important source of food security, employment and income generation, has been  severely affected by the conflict. Australia would be well placed to offer additional support.

 Peace between Israel and the Palestinian people is possible. I would urge all parties to work  together to bring an end to hostilities and give the 'Roadmap' to peace the chance to succeed.

 Mr Downer is visiting the Middle East from 25-29 January 2004.
