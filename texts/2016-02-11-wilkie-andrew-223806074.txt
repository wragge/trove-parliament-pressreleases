 SENDING KIDS TO NAURU IS A CRIME  ICC AT THE HAGUE NOTIFIED OF LATEST OUTRAGE   

 

 

 The Independent Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, has written again to the International  Criminal Court to provide further material to support an investigation into the Australian  Government for crimes against humanity in relation to asylum seekers.    

 “I have written to the ICC Prosecutor to draw her attention to the Government’s intention to  deport to Nauru 267 asylum seekers, including 30 babies, who were brought to Australia for  medical treatment,” Mr Wilkie said.   

 “We know that the Nauru Regional Processing Centre is no place for anyone, especially  children, and that if these children are returned then they will be subject to treatment that is in  breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.   

 “Moreover the Government is in contravention of the Rome Statute because it continues to  incarcerate people indefinitely without trial, forcibly transfer people to third countries and  places them in conditions causing great suffering and serious injury to mental and physical  health.   

 “If the Government won’t listen to the outrage of the Australian people, then let’s hope they  listen to the ICC.”   

 Mr Wilkie first wrote to the ICC in October 2014 asking for an investigation into the  Government in accordance with Article 15(1) of the Rome Statute. He has submitted further  evidence to the ICC since and the ICC has indicated that they are considering his submission.   

 A copy of Mr Wilkie’s latest correspondence is attached.
