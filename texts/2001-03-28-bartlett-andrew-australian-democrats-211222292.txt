 Report highlights Human Rights breaches in Detention Centre: Democrats challenge Labor to change its stance A report tabled in the Senate today from the Human Rights Commissioner found that breaches of human rights occurred in the Port Headland detention centre in 1996 and 1997.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the report presented a challenge to the Labor Party as well as the Coalition, as it condemns practices which the ALP still supports.

 The Report related to complaints from two Chinese asylum seekers and demonstrated again the dangers of ignoring human rights standards in our treatment of refugees.

 “The report finds that there were inadequacies in informing asylum seekers of their rights, slow access to advice, arbitrary detention and improper use of separation detention,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “These asylum seekers were kept in conditions akin to incommunicado. They were not able to communicate with others or get advice they were entitled to, for long periods of time.

 “It is not as dramatic as accusations of asylum seekers in detention being beaten or drugged but it is still a serious breach of human rights,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Given that the Immigration Department has rejected the findings and the recommendations in the Report, similar human rights breaches are probably still occurring.

 “The Report also makes it clear that the present policy of mandatory detention almost inevitably contravenes basic human rights,” Senator

 Bartlett said.

 “This represents a challenge to the Labor Party as well as the Coalition, as the ALP continues to support a policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers.

 “The practice of failing to inform people of their right to advice, which was condemned in the Report, is also a practice which has been endorsed in the senate by the ALP.

 “It is ironic that the Report was tabled on the same day as the Government was hoping to debate the so-called “Teoh Bill” which is aimed at reducing the requirements of governments to meet the standards set by international human rights agreements.”
