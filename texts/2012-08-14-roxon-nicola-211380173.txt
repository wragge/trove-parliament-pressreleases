 Acknowledgements 

 First, may I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land we meet on - and pay my 

 respects to their elders, both past and present. 

 I would also like to acknowledge: 

 ï· the Hon Bob Carr MP, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who shares the podium with me 

 today, 

 ï· the newly appointed President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Professor 

 Gillian Triggs,

 MP. 

 I would also like to acknowledge that we are meeting during Ramadan and thank the many 

 Muslim community groups who have made themselves available today during this holy 

 month.  

 Introduction 

 It’s a pleasure to join you today at the third annual Australian Government and Non-Government Organisations Forum on Human Rights, and my first as Attorney-General. 

 I know you are all passionate about human rights, and I welcome your commitment and 

 enthusiasm.  

 The purpose of the Forum is to provide a dedicated consultation mechanism for discussion 

 about domestic and international human rights issues. Through engaging with your 

 organisations and the wider NGO sector, we are able to develop better human rights policy, 

 informed by your experiences at the coal face of the human rights movement.  

 Australia has a solid human rights record. So much so, that often when Australians think of 

 human rights, we think of breaches far afield in Syria, Afghanistan and the like.  

 I think it’s fair to say that this leads to many Australians questioning whether we need a 

 human rights debate at all in this country.  

 But a solid human rights record cannot and should not breed complacency.  

 And, while some may see human rights as lofty and academic ideals played out in Geneva, I 

 see human rights as part of our day to day lives. 

 Human Rights are local, tangible, everyday experiences that affect Australians of all shapes 

 and sizes.  

 Human Rights are about everyone being given a fair go.  

 Whether it be about a Muslim Australian being able to practice their religion freely, a person 

 with a disability having adequate access to a public building or children learning about 

 tolerance and understanding in the school yard - human rights are in everything we do. 

 As the Attorney, I’m focussed on practical initiatives that deliver real outcomes for people, 

 and I will discuss some of these further today.  

 I also don’t apologise for being an incrementalist in pursuing human rights reforms. I strongly 

 believe we are most likely to achieve advances in human rights not through chest beating 

 and media wars, but by careful and methodical negotiation of our way through difficult 

 issues. And never taking your foot off the pedal! 

 And this is why our Government’s Human Rights Framework is so important. It lays out the 

 stepping stones to achieve improvements over time and focuses the Government’s energy 

 on the areas we can most readily influence and succeed with and I will have more to say on 

 this topic later.  

 Human rights priorities across Government 

 But, what I wanted to stress early on in my address to you today is that for our Government 

 human rights extends beyond the Attorney-General’s portfolio. We don’t often talk about 

 them as human rights issues - but they sure as hell are. 

 For Labor, human rights are in our DNA. You can see it in our priorities across Government.  

 ï· Like our establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which Labor has 

 chosen to launch a year early to benefit 20,000 Australians. The NDIS was put on the 

 national agenda because Labor wanted to end the cruel lottery of disability support, 

 where your post code determined how much help you received.  

 ï· Like our recent reforms to the tax system, where one million low-paid Australians are no 

 longer paying tax. A true Labor reform that will unburden the most marginalised 

 Australians, freeing up their scant resources to focus them on their families.  

 ï· Or take  our commitment to pay equity for low paid workers. Labor has committed 

 around $3 billion that will result in 150,000 of Australia’s lowest paid workers benefit from 

 substantial pay rises of between 23 and 45 per cent as a result of Fair Work Australia’s 

 decision. Significantly around 120,000 of these workers are women. 

 ï· Or consider our nation building project,  the NBN. Because our Government believes it 

 shouldn’t matter if you live in Sydney or Sale, Perth or Paraburdoo, in the 21st century 

 high speed broadband should be available—whether it’s there for education, for health, 

 for commerce or even for legal services.  

 ï· And like and our work to improve access to legal aid for the most vulnerable Australians. 

 This is why Labor committed more than $1.3 billion in legal assistance funding, the 

 largest commitment in over a decade. 

 All these, and many more, show the basic decency and compassion that governs our 

 decisions across all areas of government endeavour. 

 I know, for some of you, on a day such as today, you’ll be searching for these elements in 

 our acceptance of the recommendations from the expert panel’s report on asylum seekers.   

 This is an area where we have worked hard and struggled to deliver fair and just 

 outcomes.  We all know this is a very complex area, where our heartstrings are pulled in all 

 directions and our heads in just as many. 

 We have accepted the advice and recommended measures to move the balance of risk 

 away from dangerous boat journeys and towards regular migration pathways. 

 

 Today, the Government will introduce amendments that will support regional processing by 

 allowing for the transfer of persons from Australia to another location for the purpose of 

 processing their asylum claims.  

 

 It will be difficult, but it is necessary to act.  As the Panel reminds us, it is unacceptable to do 

 nothing. 

 

 Inevitably this will come up in our question time later so I won’t focus on this much more in 

 my presentation other than to say how frustrated I was with some comments in the paper 

 this morning.  One form the Greens party - again railing against someone else’s opinion (in 

 this case the Panel) by saying “people will keep dying we just won’t see them.”   

 

 The reason this particular comment so incensed me was its total lack of self-awareness, its 

 lack of understanding that there are indeed thousands, if not millions of invisible sufferers in 

 this refugee debate - not just those who get on a boat and risk their lives coming to 

 Australia. 

 

 We want to reduce that risk to life and limb, and we want to lift our eyes above those on the 

 horizon and find a way to do more to help them too. 

 

 The whole package proposed by the Houston Panel, allows us to do that.   

 

 Sure, lets debate it - but let’s not stay mired in this conservative hypocrisy which pretends 

 showing particular compassion to one group of people and ignoring the others is the only 

 option available to us. 

 

 More generally, the broad point I’m trying to make is that across portfolios, every step of the 

 way, Labor strives to pursue an agenda driven by fairness, access and opportunity.  

 Unlike the Coalition, Labor doesn’t see human rights as political correctness gone wrong. 

 We see human rights as fundamental to the fabric of our society and we have a 

 responsibility to protect and promote them.  

 Looking out for those most vulnerable is not an act of political correctness, it is an act of 

 compassion and decency.  

 It’s also an act of a good government. - and you see it run through our regional health 

 policies, or education commitments for those in disadvantaged schools or from lower socio 

 economics groups bursting into our universities or in our indigenous investments and much 

 more. 

 Australia’s Human Rights Framework 

 When we came to Government in 2007, we knew we had a lot to make up for after a decade 

 of disregard by the Coalition. But, we also knew that we had to talk to people like you about 

 the best way to continue to see improvements in Australia’s human rights policies, practices 

 and legislation. After all, it is really NGOs that provide a voice to often the marginalised 

 groups of people in our society.  

 This is why we set about with the 2009 National Human Rights Consultation, the largest 

 consultation on human rights ever undertaken in Australia. Thank you to all of you who 

 contributed to the Consultation.  

 The Consultation then helped the Government to develop and release the Australian Human 

 Rights Framework last year - a Framework that seeks to protect and promote human rights 

 in our country to make ours a fairer and a more just society. 

 The Framework looks inward at domestic application and promotion of human rights of 

 human rights as well as outward at our engagement with the wider United Nations system. 

 Five key principles guide the Framework. They are: 

 ï· reaffirming a commitment to our human rights obligations; 

 ï· the importance of human rights education; 

 ï· enhancing our domestic and international engagement on human rights issues; 

 ï· improving human rights protections including greater parliamentary scrutiny; and 

 ï· achieving greater respect for human rights principles within the community. 

 Importantly the Framework has been carefully considered to facilitate incremental 

 improvements in human rights and already the Government has achieved some early wins.  

 The Government is in the final stages of developing a new National Human Rights Action 

 Plan, which is being developed in consultation with State and Territory governments, non-government organisations and the public.  The Plan will lay out many of our priorities for the 

 coming years.  

 But, we’re not waiting for the Plan to be finalised before we deliver on some of its actions.  

 Already, we have already established the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, 

 so that now Statements of Compatibility are required for all new legislation heading into 

 Parliament.  

 Statement of Compatibility are more than a piece of paper - they ensure that the 

 Government of the day and each Minister is focussed is on ensuring that key principles of 

 freedom, respect, equality, dignity and a fair go for all Australians are considered in 

 everything the Commonwealth Parliament does. 

 We have also already committed to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against 

 Torture and announced that we will be funding a Children’s Commissioner within the 

 Australian Human Rights Commission. The Commission itself is also close to launching their 

 National Anti-Racism Partnership and Strategy that they have developed as a part of the 

 Action Plan. 

 Education as the centrepiece of the Framework 

 At the heart of our Human Rights Framework is education. Without strong and sustained 

 investment in human rights education, the framework cannot be successful.  

 This is because education is not only a tool for the community to press its rights and issues. 

 But it is also a tool for Government to produce policies that better achieve human rights 

 outcomes. 

 Labor has proudly supported strong human rights education. This is why we’ve invested in 

 the Australian Human Rights Commission, and grants including the Human Rights 

 Framework Education grants.  

 These grants show what can be achieved by determined community organisations with 

 Government support. Already, almost one million dollars has been awarded to 30 very 

 worthy community organisations across Australia through these grants. 

 Some of the real success stories include: 

 ï· “Time for Kids” which is delivering a series of human rights forums and resources for 

 vulnerable children, young people and carers in South Australia 

 ï· The Ted Noffs Foundation is running a human rights youth program to educate young 

 people from Liverpool and Fairfield about human rights issues that affect their lives using 

 arts based workshops and performances 

 ï· ‘Handball for Human Rights’, where young footy fans are learning that playing fair on the 

 field is just as important off the field through a new online game by the Eastern 

 Community Legal Centre 

 I’m also very pleased to say that I will be announcing the next round of successful grants in 

 coming weeks. 

 The Government’s continued investments in human rights education is critical to ensuring 

 Australians understand what their rights are, why they matter and how they are protected.  

 The Australian Human Rights Commission 

 As many of you would be aware, Labor’s commitment to human rights goes back a long 

 way. It was the Hawke Government that established the Human Rights and Equal 

 Opportunity Commission in 1996 to ensure that there was an independent statutory agency 

 to independently oversee Australia’s human rights record.  

 The Commission, now the Australian Human Rights Commission, is a strong institution that 

 Labor can be proud of.  

 And Labor has strengthened it further since coming to Government in 2007.  

 The newly appointed President of the Commission, Professor Gillian Triggs who joins us 

 here today, is herself an esteemed educator and brings to the position a strong commitment 

 to educating Australians about their human rights. 

 In a tight fiscal environment, the Government found the money this year to deliver on one of 

 our long-standing commitments - to fund a national Children’s Commissioner with the 

 Human Rights Commission.  

 A National Children’s Commissioner is something I championed as Opposition 

 Spokesperson for Children over 10 years ago and something I’m pleased to have delivered 

 on in Government. 

 But I would  like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the NGO community in 

 campaigning for a children’s commissioner for over 20 years, in fact introducing me to this 

 idea, and the continued involvement of NGOs as the position is established. 

 Promoting the rights, wellbeing and development of Australia’s children and young people is 

 a fundamental priority for our Government. 

 The Children’s Commissioner will be a strong and forceful voice for Australia’s children and 

 young people and will play a proactive and positive role in their wellbeing and development. 

 Importantly, the Children’s Commissioner will have a clear focus on vulnerable or at-risk 

 groups of children, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 

 children, homeless children or those who are witnessing or subjected to violence. 

 The Commissioner will give a voice to those groups of vulnerable children that haven’t had 

 one before. 

 The recruitment process for the first ever Children’s Commissioner is currently underway 

 and I expect the new Commissioner will take office by the end of the year or early in the new 

 year 

 Bizarrely, this is another one of those good ideas that was opposed by Tony Abbott’s 

 relentless negativity.  The Liberal and National Parties voted against this important measure 

 in the parliament.  

 While Australia’s human rights record is strong, as successive Governments have 

 strengthened human rights, a complex web of legislation and regulations have developed 

 with different standards for discrimination based. This is why the Government has launched 

 the human rights legislation consolidation project.  

 The consolidation is a complex, but necessary piece of work. We are aiming for a balanced 

 package. The focus is on making the protections and obligations in the anti-discrimination 

 laws clearer so that they are more user-friendly for individuals, organisations and 

 businesses. 

 This is will ensure better adherence to laws as they are clearer to understand and a simple, 

 cost-effective mechanism for resolving complaints of discrimination. 

 Draft legislation will be the subject of further consultation later this year, and I encourage you 

 all to engage with this. 

 The project will also fulfil our election commitment to introduce sexual orientation and gender 

 identity as grounds of discrimination 

 Ultimately, Australians want everyone to be given a fair go and clear, user-friendly anti-discrimination law is fundamental to this. 

 Conclusion 

 When we look back at history, we owe much thanks to those that championed human rights.  

 Voting rights for women, education of girls, abolition of slavery, voting rights and recognition 

 as citizens for indigenous Australians is not in our distant past, but really quite recent. 

 So, in this modern Australia, with human rights legislation prohibiting discrimination by race, 

 sex, disability and age, some and strong institutions like the Australian Human Rights 

 Commission, some might be tempted to say, “We’re all good here. The human rights box is 

 ticked.” 

 I know that some of my political opponents certainly do feel that way. 

 But, I’m certainly not complacent, and I’m sure you’re not either. 

 Battles for equal pay, whilst taking a big leap forward, continue.   The rights for those with 

 disabilities to use our trains is in the papers today.  A Muslim woman allowed in the 

 Olympics.  Across the world and across our country battles, large and small, will continue to 

 rage. 

 This is why Labor advocated and delivered our human rights framework.  

 We knew it was time to reaffirm our commitment to Australia’s human rights obligations. 

 We understood that ongoing human rights education is critical to ensuring Australians 

 understand what their rights are, why they matter and how they are protected. 

 That’s why our education grants are focused on the practical and tangible impact and 

 understanding of rights in our community. 

 We can see that enhancing our domestic and international engagement on human rights 

 issues develops us further as a nation.  

 We are pursuing policies and initiatives like the NDIS, pay equity, paid parental leave and 

 many others that I have mentioned that practically and unashamedly help those in need in 

 our community.  

 We want to ensure that human rights remains front and centre in the minds of Ministers and 

 all politicians, which is why we’ve acted to provide for including greater parliamentary 

 scrutiny of legislation.  

 And, we will always be striving for greater respect for human rights principles within the 

 community. 

 Most importantly, Labor does not just see human rights as manifesting itself as some lonely 

 document that gets tucked away on a bookshelf in the back offices of Parliament House.  

 We see human rights as the motivator for practical outcomes for all Australians. Things like 

 fair access to support services for people with disabilities; reforms to our tax system to give 

 the lowest-paid in our society a leg up; access to critical infrastructure like high-speed 

 broadband; and access to justice when it counts.  

 For Labor, human rights will always be about improving  lives of the silent majority, or the 

 marginalised few -  by protecting their rights in a local, tangible and meaningful way.
