 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Greens accept invitation to visit West Papua 

 Senator Kerry Nettle, 8th March 2006   

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today met with a delegation of West Papuan leaders from  the West Papua National Coalition for Liberation, and accepted an invitation to visit  the troubled province as soon as is possible.    

 The delegation of civil society, human rights and political organisations from West  Papua was in Melbourne to participate in workshops on non-violent strategies to  achieve self-determination in West Papua.    

 External spokesperson for the Coalition Rex Rumakiek extended the invitation to  Senator Nettle to visit West Papua at today's meeting in Melbourne.    

 "I am hoping to visit West Papua to see for myself the situation on the ground that has  led the 43 West Papuans now in immigration detention on Christmas Island to flee  their country. My office has begun the process of arranging an official visit," Senator  Nettle said.    

 "West Papua has been closed off to foreign journalists by the Indonesian government  and so it is all the more important that concerned politicians from around the region  visit.    

 "The delegation told me that there are many more would be refugees who are seeking  to flee overseas to salvage some hope for their lives.    

 "The West Papuans are keen to invite foreign parliamentarians to visit their province  in order that their situation can be better understood. I hope to be a part of that  process."    

 The West Papua National Coalition for Liberation is a grouping of ex-military groups,  civil society groups, and political groups who have unified under one umbrella to seek  non-violent ways to achieve self-determination for West Papuans.
