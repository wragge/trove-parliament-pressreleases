 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: MV Tampa, New Zealand And Nauru, US Decision On Lamb

 Transcript - Parliament House, Canberra - 1 September 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: The Prime Minister today has announced what appears to be a solution to the problems of the safe haven for those on board the MV Tampa. If that is the case, then that solution is in line with a resolution that was passed by the Labor Party Caucus last week. It is a solution only, however, to the situation on board the MV Tampa.

 It is not a solution to the issue of people smuggling. This cannot be repeated time and time again. What we require for the issue of people smuggling to be solved is a nation united approach to it. And all political parties have to contribute to that and we are prepared, as the Labor Party and the Opposition, to make that contribution.

 JOURNALIST: He says we don't need a carping Opposition.

 BEAZLEY: We have been a constructive Opposition throughout the course of this deliberation. Both on holding the Government accountable and on proposing solutions. One of the solutions we proposed was that no solution could be achieved unless a safe haven was found for those on board the MV Tampa.

 JOURNALIST: The Prime Minister's stated purpose when it started was to prevent queue jumpers. Given that anyone who goes to Nauru and is found to be a genuine refugee, Australia will take a share of those. Those who are found to be refugees in New Zealand will be settled in New Zealand, presumably giving them the right to live and work in Australia. Given that, haven't they succeeded in jumping the queue?

 BEAZLEY: Well, we don't know all the detail of this yet. We need to have a look at how this unfolds over the next couple of days. We're trying to get to grips with that detail now and I'll be saying a bit about that tomorrow and later during the course of the week. It's too early to make any judgements about that at this point. All we do know is this: this is not a solution to the long-term problem. It cannot possibly be a solution to the long-term problem. We need to get better solutions than this. And we need to get it in the context of a nation united - all of us in agreement. And the political parties have to contribute to that and we're prepared to be in it.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the Government has been talking to Indonesia for a considerable period of time now to try and stop people smuggling. It's clear that Indonesia isn't taking the Government's plea

 seriously. How do you actually force another country to act?

 BEAZLEY: Generally speaking, to get agreements on things like this requires a quality relationship and a lot of hard work - and have this as part of that relationship. We negotiated very hard with the Chinese on these matters years ago. And even though many nations are experiencing a degree of migration, much of it illegal from China - we are not. And that went to the quality of the relationship that the previous Government managed to negotiate. The same applies in this instance.

 JOURNALIST: You say you want a nation united and you want political parties agreed. How far are you prepared to move in getting agreement with the Government - or does the Government have to move to you?

 BEAZLEY: It's interesting. The other day in Parliament the Immigration Minister said the Labor Party agreed with him on 90 per cent of the proposals he was putting forward but not on the 10. It does suggest there's been movement by the Labor Party - what about the other 10?

 JOURNALIST: Any idea how the Government's announcement that it's going to step up patrols in the sea a bit, isn't it a rather impotent gesture, given that - isn't it the same catch-22, if they're in international waters, there's not much authority to turn them away. If they're in Australian waters they're obliged to process them under international agreements.

 BEAZLEY: I would have said it was a pretty good case for a coastguard, myself, which the Labor Party has been advocating for some considerable period of time. And there is a deal that can be done in ensuring that our borders are protected by a good coastguard. And now that the Government has had a look at the sorts of problems that we're confronting, perhaps they'll give some better thought to that suggestion of ours. But there is no one solution to this problem. There are a variety of solutions. And I'm going to be saying more about that during the week.

 JOURNALIST: Has this harmed our relationship with Indonesia?

 BEAZLEY: We have a difficult relationship with Indonesia and we've not worked hard enough at it. And I'll be saying more about that during the course of the week, too.

 JOURNALIST: Realistically, though, Mr Beazley, I mean, given the enormity of the East Timor situation, do you really believe that we could have sent Australian troops into East Timor and then within two years be lovey dovey enough to resolve a very delicate, sensitive issue like this?

 BEAZLEY: There's a sort of four letter word that applies to the essential task of all those who are in Government - it's called work. And you can't always have for yourself the best possible climate. But what you do always require is working as hard as you can to improve a situation if you've got a difficulty. And I'm going to be saying more about that during the week.

 JOURNALIST: You're saying there's a lack of work on this side of that relationship. Isn't part of the reality that if the President doesn't return our Prime Minister's calls, it's all very well to criticise the Prime Minister, but what about the President of Indonesia? It's a two-way street.

 BEAZLEY: As I said, I'm going to be saying a bit more about that during the course of the week, and I note that the Government has decided that they're going to put in a bit of an effort on that themselves now. Pity that wasn't done months and months ago.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, even if you do have a coastguard, you can't really humanely turn away hundreds of people on board rickety old fishing vessels. Doesn't the solution lie further up the chain from where these people are coming from and their path through the archipelago?

 BEAZLEY: It certainly does. As I said, a coastguard is part of the solution, it's not the whole solution. And the starting point is where they come from. And that is the essential challenge for all Australian Governments.

 JOURNALIST: Is Nauru up to this, and do you think they've just done it out of the goodness of their hearts, or do you think we've given them five bucks behind our back?

 BEAZLEY: I have no details at all - and I take it that you don't either. And like I said, we have to take a look at those details before we could comment on them further. All we can say is that there appears to be a solution that provides a safe haven and that is what our Caucus resolution called for last week. But what you and I and everyone else out there knows, this is no permanent solution, or one that is capable of a repeat. We've got to get a national approach to these issues and all political parties have to contribute.

 JOURNALIST: Aren't we going to look a bit silly being rescued by New Zealand and Nauru? Isn't that humiliating?

 BEAZLEY: It's early days to be able to tell what the detail of this is. And I notice the Prime Minister himself didn't say emphatically that this was an end to the matter. All I can say is that from our point of view we've stuck with this point, and that is that is that a safe haven had to be found for the people on board the MV Tampa. This appears to be a move in that direction.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, what's your response to claims by the UNHCR that if they've got to find a safe haven, why couldn't they have just come into Australia and be processed?

 BEAZLEY: We make a generous contribution on refugees. We've done it for years and years with the UNHCR. There's only about 10 countries which do. And I think that it's a position that we ought to sustain. As I said at the outset, we just wanted a safe haven for these people. And if a safe haven has been found then it's in line with the things that we've been talking about.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, given that the outcome appears to be in line with the Labor Caucus resolution, are you prepared to provide some qualified congratulations to Mr Howard in gaining this outcome?

 BEAZLEY: We were mocked when we said that this was an essential component of any resolution of this matter. All we can say about that now is that it appears the Government has moved in that direction.

 JOURNALIST: In retrospect, what do you make of the Prime Minister's decision not to attend the Pacific Island forums in Nauru because he was visiting Megawati the weekend before?

 BEAZLEY: It's always got to be possible for prime ministers to chew gum and walk at the same time. If you've got responsibilities in the South Pacific and responsibilities in South East Asia, it's not beyond the wit of the Foreign Affairs Department or the Prime Minister's office to be able to do both.

 JOURNALIST: …lamb decision?

 BEAZLEY: We welcome the decision that has been taken on lamb. But there are many, many bilateral

 issues that we have with the United States which need resolution too. And the task before those who would be in government and those who are in government is to get those issues resolved as well.

 JOURNALIST: Labor was sceptical about the extension to the two week extension to the negotiating period only two weeks ago…

 BEAZLEY: It did appear at the time that we'd folded one of our cards. If that proved not to be decisive, well that's a good thing. Generally speaking, you don't fold your hand before you've achieved the outcome. But if this outcome has been achieved and the hand folded first, well, that's no bad thing. But there are many other things to be done.
