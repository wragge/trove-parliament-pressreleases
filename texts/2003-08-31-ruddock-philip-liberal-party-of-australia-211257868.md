 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 TV Program Demonstrates Labor's Policy Weakness

 MPS 58/2003

 Abuse of the asylum system similar to that in Britain could happen here under ALP policies the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 The Ch9 Sunday program today broadcast a story from the BBC outlining ways in which the asylum and welfare system in  Britain is being rorted. A BBC employee posing as an asylum seeker used false identities and documents to make asylum  applications, work and obtain benefits, after claiming to have arrived unlawfully.

 Many people make unsuccessful claims in several countries before arriving in Britain and hundreds of thousands of failed  asylum seekers have disappeared into the community.

 The ALP wants to move Australia down this track by working to dismantle mandatory detention for unlawful non-citizens. 

 Doing so would undermine the integrity of Australia's borders and its immigration programs.

 Mandatory detention ensures people are available for health, character and identity checks. It also ensures they are available  for processing and are available for removal should they make unsuccessful claims for asylum.

 If the British reporter had approached authorities in Australia claiming to have arrived without a visa, she would have been  detained while her claims were assessed and the deception would have ended very quickly.

 The ALP should take note of the situation in Britain and other countries where unlawful arrivals disappear into the community  and admit that their policies would lead Australia down the same path.

 If Australia wants to have an orderly, planned migration program, it must be able to maintain the integrity of its borders.  Labor Party policy will not achieve that.
