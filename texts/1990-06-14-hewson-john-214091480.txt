 Leader of the Opposition

 TRANSCRIPT OF DR HEWSON, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 DOORSTOP, CANBERRA 14 JUNE 1990

 E & Î E - PROOF COPY ONLY

 Journalist:

 ... (inaudible) .  .  .

 Hewson:

 I know no more really than we knew at the time of the last  election apart from the speculation in the newspapers today  suggesting that it might be on the Gold Coast. As I said at the  time of the last election we were opposed to a separate city  concept and we had based that view on a consultants report,  admittedly then a preliminary report, which suggested that it  would take something like 20 years before such a city would have  a favourable effect on our balance of payments and of course it  would involve a significant increase in overseas debt and foreign 

 investment for little·net economic gain.  So my position is the  same, I remain to be convinced that some other form of Multi  Function Polis will bring the benefits of technology transfer  which might otherwise be available in some other form.

 Journalist:

 Do you think it is all going too quickly at this stage, the fact  that they are deciding a site right now?

 I am surprised, if the press reports today are correct that they  are going to announce the site first and then the nature of the  operation second, I find that a bit surprising. I think I have  got to look at what they propose in terms of the nature of the  operation before we can really comment. There has been an active  debate about possible and I gather some competition between  different cities and other locations so you can understand I 

 suppose why they are doing it that way.

 .... (inaudible) ....

 Hewson:

 The point I have made about a separate city is that I just can't  see the value in an exercise which effectively starts from  scratch and builds a city and you know all the roads, schools,  bridges and everything else that go as part of that, to derive 

 some benefits from technology transfer that are probably there  in some existing form or through some existing city and that has  been the basis of our assessment in the past. I remain to be  convinced that the advantages of a Multi Function Polis, as it  has been described, are there to be had.

 Journalist:

 Dr Hewson do you believe the Australian Government should be  taking a firmer line with Indonesia on its apparent support for  Cambodian boat people coming to Northern Australia?

 Hewson:

 I haven't seen the Indonesian statement of support. Our position  on the boat people is the same as on the Chinese students and  that is that in all cases you have to determine whether they are  dr they are not refugees on a case by case basis and that is the only way to go.  I think the Prime Minister will ultimately come  back to that way in relation to the Chinese students, he has got  to follow that in relation to the boat people.

 Journalist:

 I think the Indonesian Government was assisting the Cambodians to come to this country, wouldn't you be concerned and wduldn't you  be saying that ....

 Hewson:  .

 It is not right for me to comment until I know that that is a  fact. All I can say is that they arrive on our shores as  refugees, or claiming to be refugees, then that is subject to  determination by the Dors Committee, there are established  procedures for that, it is the only way to go. I know in the 

 case of the Chinese that it would involve more resources, but it  is still the only way to go, it is the only way to get genuine  compassion and justice out of what is a very difficult situation.

 Journalist: .

 The American and Canadian Government's have decided to give  extended temporary visas and then to reconsider the issue. Why  don't you think that that is appropriate here?

 Hewson:

 I have thought all along that the only way under our rules is for  a case by case assessment. You might as well make the decision  up front on the basis of the information that you have to hand. If they are going to be subject to a genuine reprisal on return  to their home country that is an important consideration in  determining refugee status. I know there are other options, the  Canadians and the New Zealanders have gone that other route, I 

 think the only way to clarify our situation which is now  unbelievably confused over the last few weeks is for the Prime  Minister to simply go back to what was a well established  practice, which is a case by case assessment. It is the only 

 fair and compassionate thing to do.

 Journalist:

 Will you support additional resources for the Department of  Immigration to allow that to happen?

 Hewson:

 We have said that that should be done. To be fair though, we  have been arguing this case now for guite some time. It has been  an issue since June of last year.  We have been urging the  Government to tell us what they would do about it, I am surprised 

 they have left it this long.  But it still is the only to do it,  so yes we would support more resources.

 Journalist:

 The Prime Minister's office has made it clear now that those  Chinese refugees who were here before June 20th last year can  stay permanently if they want to. Do you agree with that?

 Hewson: .

 They have gone around so many circles.  We have gone from the  fact of permanency through to a potential to stay from 6 months  to 10 years and now back to permanency. I still think the only  way to do it is to go on a case by case basis through that 

 process.  There is no other way. It is the only fair way to  determine if they are genuine refugees whether they be boat  people or Chinese students.

 The National Party has been doing some surveying of its members  and it has found concern about religious fanaticism amongst  Middle Eastern immigrants.  Do you think that should be taken  into consideration in immigration policies?

 Hewson:

 I haven't seen that, I'm sorry.

 Journalist:

 Should it be taken into consideration?

 Hewson:  .

 I can't comment without knowing the point that you are making in  some detail. In my view the issue of refugees is simply based on  the determination under well established rules.

 Journalist: '

 About immigrants, are you concerned about the level of religious  fanaticism of some immigrants that are coming to Australia?

 Hewson: .

 The only comments that I am prepared to make on immigration  relate to the need for a debate on the basis of the costs and  benefits, if you like, on immigration intakes of different size. I am trying to keep other issues separate from that debate.

 Journalist:

 Given the strained relations between Australia and China after  the Tienanmien massacre do you support the National Party's move  to send a trade delegation there at the end of the year?

 Hewson:

 Well the Government itself has been maintaining contacts with  the Chinese. We have put, I think Senator Hill put a motion in  the Parliament in May urging caution I guess, in terms of the .   nature of our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that they  understand that to restore that relationship in some sense, or to 

 further develop it, there should be an acceptance on their part  as to the need to protect human rights.  I think contact with the  Chinese, whether it is by the National Party or Government

 Journalist: .

 Minister's or whatever, provides you with the opportunity, in  this case in relation to trade, to make that point.  I think it  is a very important point. We are concerned about human rights,   you don't cut off links, you do establish and continue to  maintain links of various sorts while the situation is as fluid 

 as it is and as I say both sides have been involved in that  process. The key point is the human rights point which Senator  Hill put on the record.

 Journalist:

 So would you be urging the National's to raise those human rights  issues in the trade delegation that goes over?

 Hewson:

 Yes, I think that further development of our trading relationship  should be linked to their performance in relation to human  rights. .

 journalist:

 Did the National's consult you about this trip?

 Hewson: ,

 No, I didn't know about it in advance.

 Journalist:

 Is that satisfactory?

 Hewson:

 I haven't actually talked to Tim Fischer about it since either.  I can understand the concern that is being expressed generally  about the nature of our trading links with the Chinese and I can  understand their concern and their interest in doing what they  are doing.

 Journalist:

 Mr Fischer wants his Party to have increased flexibility ...  (inaudible) ...?

 Hewson:

 Well it is not a question of giving them flexibility. We have a  pretty flexible arrangement in a sense now. We have clear cut  understandings in relation to policy development, they're joint  policies.  We have a very clear understanding as to the nature of  representation in the Shadow Ministry and the Shadow Cabinet and  that sort of thing. We each then go out and market our joint  policies and our images in the way that we best see fit.  I know 

 that there has been a fair bit of media interest in the notion of  competition between us and. them in various seats presently held,  for example by the Labor Party. We both see that as the best way  to increase the conservative vote. It has always been a factor, 

 it has always been a feature of those contests and the better we  both do in raising our profile in those sorts of seats in  competition with each other the better the conservative vote is  and the better our chances of taking the seat off the Government.

 Thank you!
