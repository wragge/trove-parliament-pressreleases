 Statement from Senator Hanson-Young  Australian Greens’ Spokesperson for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Australia must increase direct resettlement from Indonesia immediately:  Greens    

 “The Indonesian Government are right, the best way of easing the pressure and stopping the flow of  boats is by increasing Australia’s intake.    

 Despite the Houston Panel’s recommendation to increase the direct resettlement of genuine  refugees from Indonesia, to date, Australia have only resettled 266 refugees, well below the  recommended 3,800 boost needed from the region.    

 We cannot risk anymore lives being lost at sea, we must uphold our obligation to these people by  giving people hope of resettlement. This can only be achieved if the Labor government acts upon  Indonesia’s call, and immediately increases the number of genuine refugees being resettled in  Australia.   

 Dumping refugees in Malaysia is unsafe, towing boats back is dangerous, what we need is get back  to the humane policy for refugees, not the race to the bottom from Labor and Liberal."
