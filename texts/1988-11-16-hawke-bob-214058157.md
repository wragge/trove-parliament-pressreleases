 PRIME MINISTER

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER  PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW  CANBERRA - 16 NOVEMBER 1988

 Last year I had the honor of an invitation to visit  Singapore to deliver the annual Singapore Lecture. It was  an invitation I was very pleased to accept,  and I chose as 

 my theme "The Challenge of Change in the Asia/Pacific  Region".

 As I told my audience on that occasion, there could be few  more appropriate places than Singapore to discuss the  challenge of change in our region. For in many ways  Singapore is a model of the region's increasing importance 

 in the global economy; it has proven itself a paragon of  flexibility in the face of changing circumstances.

 Ladies and gentlement,  today it is our very great pleasure  to welcome the man whose leadership and vision has been  crucial, over a long and distinguished career,  in making  Singapore one of the success stories of our times. There  can be no question that our guest today, Prime Minister Lee  Kuan Yew, is one of the great figures of our region, and of 

 the Commonwealth, and it is indeed an honour and a pleasure  to welcome him and his party to Canberra today.

 Prime Minister,  this Bicentennial year has been a year of  celebration for Australia, a year in which we have received  many distinguished visitors from all corners of the world.  But let me say that your visit looms large on our  Bicentennial calendar,  and we welcome you today as a special 

 friend of Australia. ’

 It has been gratifying to note during the course of the year  that the friendship between our two countries and peoples  has been underlined repeatedly by Singapore's participation  in Bicentennial events, including Expo 88 in Brisbane,  the 

 International Bicentennial Trade Fair in Melbourne and,  most recently, at the Aerospace Exposition in Sydney.

 Prime Minister,  during your time in government you have seen  profound changes take place both in Singapore and in  Australia :  the development of Singaporean nationhood, and  the emergence of the Singaporean economy as a powerful force 

 in an increasingly dynamic region - and, for our part, our  transition from an inward-looking, protectionist, sometimes  xenophobic presence perched on the edge of Asia to a nation  more thoroughly and effectively enmeshed in the 

 opportunities and challenges of regional development.

 Under your leadership, Singapore has always been at the  forefront of this regional dynamism. Apart from brief  downturns this decade, you have maintained consistently high  growth rates over the last twenty-five years, and your per 

 capita income has risen rapidly to become one of the highest  in Asia.

 I quote such achievements in order to comment on the means  by which they have been achieved - in particular, to note  that your prosperity has been underpinned by an open  approach to international trade, with virtually no tariffs 

 and a strong exposure to international market forces. That  Singapore is a leading trading nation is a testament both to  your own leadership and to the drive and commitment of your  people. As you reminded us this morning, Singapore's total 

 trade is three times its GDP.

 At a time when so much needs to be done in cutting back  protectionism and discriminatory policies in the  international economy, the Singapore experience bears  witness to the advantages of a competitive export-oriented 

 approach to economic growth. ,

 Of course our two economies have very different economic  resources and specialisations. But in an interdependent  world, open, diversified trade for both of us is the key to  enhanced prosperity.

 Our recognition in Australia of that fact has led us to  undertake a broad-ranging program of structural reform. Our  policies of deregulation and trade liberalisation are  intended to place Australia's manufacturing and services 

 sectors in a better position to join with Singapore and the  other countries of the region in a more integrated  commercial relationship.

 In other words, Australia increasingly recognises that our  future prospects depend on our continued ability to enmesh  ourselves successfully in this region. As my colleague, John Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and  Commerce said to you this morning in our talks, over the 

 last five years Australia's attitude to trade with the  Asia-Pacific region has transformed from a perception of  threats to a perception of opportunities.

 In the early 1950's, less than 20 per cent of our exports  were to the countries on the western rim of the Pacific.  Today 54 per cent of Australia's exports are destined to  these countries, which in turn provide 41 per cent of our 

 imports. Among ASEAN nations Singapore is our largest  trading partner, with two-way trade exceeding two billion  Australian dollars in 1987/88.

 In a time when we may be seeing the emergence of trading  blocs which could have long-term effects on the multilateral  trading system, Australia and Singapore have a common  interest in strengthening multilateralism and contributing 

 thereby to economic growth and stability for all countries.

 Mr Prime Minister, I have concentrated thus far on economic  and trade issues. In so doing I do not wish to understate  the many global and regional issues that are of shared  concern to us both.

 As Australia's ASEAN dialogue partner, Singapore has a key  role in our relations with ASEAN - which is now entering its  third decade as one of the most successful regional  organisations in the world.

 You and I have discussed many times the issues of a  continuing United States' presence in the Western Pacific  and I know that you are a strong supporter of that presence.  I am also very pleased to note your steadfast support for  the Five Power Defence Arrangements and for a continuing  active Australian defence presence in the region.

 Singapore, as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty, shares Australia's views about the vital importance  of the Treaty and the need to make every effort to prevent  the spread of nuclear weapons. And our officials are  discussing Australia's suggested exploration of a regional 

 effort against the proliferation of chemical weapons

 There are many political problems that remain in the region.  We need to face continuing problems in Indo-China, with a  just and lasting resolution to the Cambodia question only 

 now possibly beginning to emerge, and with the question of  the refugee outflow from Indo-China still to be resolved.  There is uncertainty in Burma.

 There is also however, some cause for optimism, with a more  favourable super-power relationship, an emerging Sino-Soviet  dialogue, continued economic growth in the region and  democratic reform underway in the Republic of Korea.

 Singapore's voice in the affairs of the region is always  listened to with respect.

 I was very pleased to note, for example, that in your visit  to Fiji last week, you spoke on the value of racial  tolerance and inter-ethnic harmony. This is an issue in  which you have taken an unyielding and consistent stand in  many international forums, not least in Commonwealth  deliberations on South Africa.

 Singapore has long been regarded as a model of a successful  multicultural society. That success is due in considerable  measure to your own efforts.  As in economic matters, your  success in this regard provides a valuable example for the  Asia-Pacific region.

 Mr Prime Minister,

 Singapore and Australia have traditionally maintained an  excellent dialogue on all issues - international,  regional  and bilateral - no matter how difficult they may be. Healthy regional relations depend not only on the free flow  of goods and services,  but also on the free flow of ideas,   both directly and through the media.

 You and I have met many times in many parts of the world. We have discussed, dissected, argued over and agreed on many  issues, but always as partners and always as friends.

 That partnership and friendship is one that I personally  value.  It is one that is valued by all Australians and it  is one which I believe is of benefit to Singapore as well.

 It is against this background that Hazel and I are pleased  to have you and Mrs Lee with us today. .  Your visit allows us  to repay something of the friendship you have shown towards  Australia over your many years as Prime Minister of 

 Singapore.  It seems only fitting that as our Bicentennial  year draws to a close we should receive you as our special  guest.
