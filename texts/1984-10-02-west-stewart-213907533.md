 WEST IMPROVES MIGRANT ACCESS

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Stewart  West, today announced that six new Migrant Access Centres  would soon be established by the Federal Labor Government,  throughout Australia.

 "As part of the Government's commitment to assist migrants,  the Centres will provide information and advice to new  arrivals, to help them successfully settle in Australia," Mr  West said.

 The Centres will be located in or near the city offices of  the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney,  Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Darwin.

 "The Migrant Access Centres are especially designed to reach  the 80 par cent of new arrivals, including family reunion  migrants, who move directly into the community,” Mr West  said.

 "I have been concerned for some time that these people do  not have access to the orientation programs and services  available at Migrant Hostels.

 "Although they usually have the support of friends,  relatives, or employers, it is important that the Government  provides them with expert advice on their new life in  Australia."

 Mr West said that Australia's migrants and refugees were  entitled to Government and community services which requires  knowledge of the services available.

 "The Migrant Access Centres will provide the opportunity for  individual and group information sessions on a range of  services," Mr West said.

 °An important feature of the Centres will be the access they  give to other Government and community services to meeting  the needs of our new arrivals.0

 Hr West added that the Migrant Access Centres would  complement other Federal Government migrant programs,  especially the network of Migrant Resource Centres.

 "The Migrant Access Centres will serve a wide cross-section  of migrants throughout the community, and because of their  central location, will be accessible to all migrants. The  Migrant Resource Centre network will continue to provide a  more specialised and specific service in local areas."

 Mr West said the establishment of the Migrant Access Centres  was a further demonstration of the Labor Government’s  commitment to provide services to migrants which were  responsive to their needs.

 The Centres will be officially launched with the opening of  the Darwin Migrant Access Centre in November. The other  Centres will open progressively.
