 Lines sent to AAP on Migration Act Reform and Settlement Services

 Democrat's Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew said that last night's Democrat immigration  forum confirmed what the Democrats have long been saying about the failure of the Migration Act.   

 "The Migration Act is excessively complex, confusing, inefficient and unfair. There is no doubt that we  need to see a complete overhaul of the Act, not just the administrative rearrangements we have seen to  date."    

 "It is also time to have clearly defined criteria for 'complementary protection' built into the Act, rather than  the ad hoc and arbitrary arrangements that are currently in place. This is essential to speed up difficult  cases and to ensure that people who might not fit the precise criteria of the Refugee Convention but  none the less will be in extreme danger if they are returned to their country."   

 Another important issue that Senator Bartlett has raised in the Senate which is being reflected by  growing concerns at community level is the need for improved settlement services for all migrants and  refugees.   

 "Whilst Australia has done relatively well with settlement services in the past, the situation is changing  and evolving, and there is a growing number of migrants and refugees who are not getting the  assistance they need to enable them to settle promptly and securely into their new environment,"  Senator Bartlett said.    

 "For example, the most recent arrivals from Africa have very different needs from previous waves of  migrants and refugees. The information I have received from those on the ground is that service  providers are desperately in need of information and cultural training on how to adequately deal with  these specific needs."   

 "In order to prevent community disaffection with migration and refugee intake, as well as to prevent  future events like the Cronulla incident, we need to look at issues which go to the root of the problem.  Without appropriate settlement services, migrants are alienated from the wider community and the wider  community believes that they aren't making the effort to fit in. In order to foster better outcomes for  society as a whole we must ensure that we look after our newest Citizens," Senator Bartlett said.
