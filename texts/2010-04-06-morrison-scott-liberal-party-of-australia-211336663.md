 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Coalition will act to stop the boats 

 Tuesday 6th April 2010 

 The arrival of the 104th boat since the Rudd Government’s rollback of the Coalition’s strong 

 border protection regime highlights the need for decisive action to get our borders back 

 under control, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow 

 Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.??  

 

 “Under Labor 104 boats have arrived carrying 4772 people and boats are arriving at a record 

 of over 11 a month,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 “Christmas Island is full, detainees whose claims have been rejected are being transferred 

 off Christmas Island in midnight charter flights, people are escaping from detention centres, 

 and the boats just keep on coming,” he said.  

 

 “While Kevin Rudd remains in border protection denial, the Coalition has a clear plan to get 

 our borders back under control. If elected to government the Coalition will:  

 

 â¢ Reintroduce Temporary Protection Visas  

 

 â¢ Adopt a no-compromise position on offshore processing  

 

 â¢ Turn boats back where circumstances allow  

 

 â¢ Deliver regional partnerships and strategies to combat people smuggling  

 

 â¢ Play our role as part of the international community to reduce conflict in source countries  

 

 “Australians are rightly concerned that under Kevin Rudd, people smugglers are now 

 deciding who comes to our country and the circumstances in which they come.  

 

 “The costs of Labor’s border failures are also spiralling out of control, with each single 

 person who arrives illegally by boat costing almost $82,000 and regular charter flights now 

 ferrying asylum seekers to the mainland from an overcrowded Christmas Island.  

 

 “Only a Coalition Government will take the action necessary to once again get our borders 

 under control,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 Mr Keenan said: “Christmas Island is already at boiling point yet the pressure continues to 

 increase as the Government struggles to cope with the consequences of their failed border 

 protection policies.  

 

 “The worse this crisis becomes, the more the Rudd Labor Government turns to spin to 

 deflect attention,” he said.  

 

 “The details of these regular arrivals are becoming increasingly sketchy.  

 

 “The Rudd Labor Government is trying to play down the seriousness of this crisis by 

 generalising these arrivals and refusing to provide basic information to the Australian people 

 about where and when boats have been intercepted and exactly who is on board.  

 

 “What is clear is the Rudd Labor Government has lost control of Christmas Island, and lost 

 control of Australia’s borders,” he said.
