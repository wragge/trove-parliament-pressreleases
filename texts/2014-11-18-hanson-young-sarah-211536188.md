 Slashing Indonesian refugee intake? Wrong way,  go back   

 The Australian Greens have called on Scott Morrison to listen to expert advice, reverse his  dangerous slashing of Australia’s refugee intake from Indonesia and instead offer protection to  refugees in need.   

 “This is the exact opposite of what the government should be doing,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “We should be working with our neighbours, accelerating refugee processing and increasing  Australia’s intake from the region so that people are given a safe way to reach protection. That’s the  only way we can save lives at sea while caring for refugees.   

 “This narrow-minded, hard-hearted approach is dangerous and it doesn’t reflect the Australian  belief in fairness and the fair go.   

 “Cutting off another escape route will doom Afghan Hazaras who are persecuted by the Taliban and  Iraqi Christians who are fleeing for their lives.   

 “This decision will cost lives but the Abbott government simply doesn’t care.”
