 I am grateful to the Nigerian Institute of International 

 Affairs for its gracious invitation to speak here this 

 afternoon.

 I would like to use this occasion to say something about 

 Australia's relations with Africa and,  more importantly,  

 about how we can build on that relationship. I also want 

 to say something about the importance to countries like 

 Australia and Nigeria of international cooperation and of 

 the multilateral system. My country is a long way from 

 Africa but we face many common challenges:  challenges

 which require an international perspective and an 

 understanding of the value of interdependence.

 It is particularly appropriate that I make this speech on 

 Australia's developing partnership with Africa in Lagos. 

 For in so many ways Nigeria epitomises Africa - its 

 regional leadership,  its sophisticated diplomacy and its 

 deep commitment to African unity are highly regarded by 

 Australia. We especially value the special role Nigeria 

 has played in the Commonwealth and at the United Nations 

 in the struggle against apartheid. I am thinking in 

 particular of the outstanding contribution Major-General 

 Nwachukwu has made to the work of the Commonwealth Foreign 

 Ministers' Committee on Southern Africa, of the skilful 

 leadership Ambassador Garba in New York has given to the 

 UN Special Committee against apartheid, and the enormously

 IV/89

 2.

 constructive role played by General Obasanjo in the 

 Eminent Persons' Group and as author of the study on the 

 security needs of the Front Line States.

 I single out Nigeria's important role in the fight against 

 apartheid because apartheid in so many ways has been the 

 touchstone of Australia's relationship with Africa. Prior 

 to the 1960s - when so many African states achieved their 

 independence - Australia's understanding of Africa was 

 limited. Africa was regarded not only as a distant 

 continent but our impressions of it were essentially 

 derivative. Despite our own colonial experience, our 

 outlook on Africa reflected a basically uncritical 

 acceptance of British views on what was then its African 

 empire.

 Since then we have established a number of diplomatic 

 missions in Africa which have given us an opportunity to 

 make our own considered judgements. But it was only with 

 the election of the Whitlam Labor Party Government in 1972 

 that Australia made a serious effort to develop its 

 relations with Africa.

 The Whitlam Government put the fight against apartheid at 

 the centre of Australia's relations with Africa. And that 

 policy, anchored on the premise that no Australian 

 Government should condone institutionalised racism, has 

 been adhered to by successive Australian Governments. It 

 also reflected an honest effort on our part to come to 

 grips with our domestic situation where Aboriginal 

 Australians had been victims of racism and 

 discrimination. In opposing apartheid we were signalling 

 that racism had no part to play in Australian domestic 

 policies and that historical wrongs needed to be righted. 

 The Fraser Government which succeeded the Whitlam 

 Government built on this legacy and indeed took a 

 forthright stance on African questions including a 

 Zimbabwe settlement. This owed much to Mr Fraser's 

 personal commitment, and his retirement from the

 3.

 Australian Parliament has not lessened his involvement in 

 issues of concern to Africa.

 Australia's position on Apartheid reflects both a 

 rejection of the morality of apartheid and an assessment 

 that an end to apartheid is a necessary precondition for 

 regional stability in Southern Africa.

 South Africa is a long way from Australia. But distance 

 does not exempt us from the obligation - as a good 

 international citizen, and as a liberal democracy 

 committed to upholding fundamental human rights - to do 

 what we can to help end a system which is so manifestly 

 immoral. We live in a world of many inequalities and many 

 injustices. But the system of apartheid stands so far ,  

 beyond the pale that it simply cannot be regarded as just 

 another unpalatable regime. If we wash our hands of it - 

 on the comfortable but indecent justification that it is 

 too far away or too intractable a problem - we not only 

 fail in our humanitarian duty but we debase the very 

 values which are at the core of our sense of self and 

 community. Australians know from the ghosts of their own 

 past how destructive a force racism is.

 For all these reasons, Australia has been a very active 

 participant in the international campaign against 

 apartheid, both at the UN and in the Commonwealth. Along 

 with Nigeria, we are a member of the Commonwealth Foreign 

 Ministers' Committee on Southern Africa; it was the 

 latest meeting of that Committee last week at Harare that 

 in fact brought me to the continent at this time. I look 

 forward to playing host at the next meeting of the 

 Committee which will be held in Canberra in July or 

 August. As it will be the last meeting before 

 Commonwealth Heads of Government meet in Kuala Lumpur next 

 October, it will have a particular importance.

 In our work with the Committee, we have placed particular 

 emphasis on the effectiveness of sanctions in the 

 financial arena, and Australian experts made a central

 4.

 contribution to the influential Commonwealth Study on 

 South Africa's International Financial Relations which set 

 so much1  of the current sanctions agenda.

 Australia is a firm believer that broadly applied 

 sanctions will have a substantial impact on the South 

 African Government. We support the imposition of 

 comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South 

 Africa but, for them to be effective they need to be 

 applied by the whole international community.

 At the national level we have nevertheless taken several 

 measures including banning the import of South African 

 coal, iron, steel, uranium and agricultural products and 

 cutting all air links with South Africa. We have also 

 imposed drastic restrictions on sporting links with South 

 Africa.

 Australia is an active member of the UN Council for 

 Namibia. We are participating in UNTAG, the UN Force to 

 oversee the implementation of UN Security Council 

 Resolution 435. We shall be contributing a contingent of 

 250 engineers and 50 headquarters and support staff.

 I would not like to leave you with the impression that 

 apartheid is the only issue on Australia's African 

 agenda. We are sensitive to the many other issues - 

 especially refugees, debt and economic development - which 

 are of concern to African countries. Our capacity to be 

 engaged in these areas is necessarily limited but we 

 nevertheless hope that we can make some contribution. Of 

 course, this is a two-way process. There is much 

 Australians can learn from their contacts with Africa and 

 with Africans:  I particularly recall our rewarding

 inter-action with African students in Australia.

 Australia has provided development assistance to 

 sub-Sahara Africa for over 25 years.  Notwithstanding

 5. f ‘

 competing claims from the Asia-Pacific region, the level 

 of assistance to the Southern African Development 

 Cooperation Conference (SADCC) countries - the principal 

 focus in Africa - was recently raised from $A55 million to 

 $A100 million over the three years,  1987 to 1990. In 

 addition, further Australian funding to Africa is made 

 available through the multilateral system and in response 

 to emergency and refugee situations.

 As a country of refugee resettlement itself, Australia is 

 well aware of the extraordinary efforts that hard pressed 

 African countries have made in providing assistance to 

 refugees. Africa hosts approximately half of the world's 

 refugee population of over 13 million. It is a tribute to 

 the countries of Africa that of that vast number,  third 

 country resettlement is required by only very few - less 

 than 0.1 per cent of the total refugee population.

 Australia is doing what it can to help. Last year we gave 

 some $21 million to emergency and refugee program 

 assistance to Sub Saharan Africa. We also resettle in 

 Australia a small number of African refugees each year.

 The long term solution to so many problems throughout the 

 world lies in economic development. That in turn depends 

 on building up economic infrastructures and expanding 

 trading opportunities.

 Australia is interested in developing mutually beneficial 

 trading links with Africa.  In 1987/88 Australia's exports 

 to Africa, including North Africa, amounted to only $609 

 million or 1.5 per cent of total exports. Imports from 

 Africa accounted for only $369 million, less than one per 

 cent of total imports. Clearly, there is room here for 

 improvements in both directions.

 Australia has products and expertise beyond basic 

 commodities which we think could be of interest to many 

 African countries.  In telecommunications we have

 6.

 developed considerable experience in long distance, high 

 capacity trunk systems,  traffic network management and 

 rural telecommunications. Our overseas telecommunications 

 authority,  OTC, has particular expertise in the provision 

 of international telecommunications. It has been chosen 

 to establish a telecommunications satellite network for 

 Pacific island states and a similar scheme may well be 

 appropriate to some African countries. AUSSAT - which 

 provides our satellite telecommunications - has a well 

 developed capability in designing,  establishing and 

 operating satellite broadcasting and telecommunications 

 systems for remote as well as commercial application.

 Australia is well placed to assist sub-Saharan Africa with 

 agricultural development,  particularly in such areas as »  

 agroforestry, animal health and nutrition, water and soil 

 management, and dry land farming.

 Most African countries share with Australia a dependence 

 on commodity exports to underpin national income. This 

 gives us a common cause in the defence of an open and fair 

 international trading system, especially in agricultural 

 trade.

 The world is facing an uncertain trading future. At stake 

 is whether or not we move further in the direction of a 

 multilateral system of global trade - the engine of 

 economic growth over the last four decades - or we give in 

 to protectionist impulses and engage in a self-defeating 

 trade war.

 Australia and Africa have much to lose if the current 

 Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations were to 

 fail. It will be the ordinary citizens throughout the 

 world that will have to pay the price if we are unable to 

 preserve free trade. The collapse of a liberal world 

 trading system will leave us all poorer and in the wake of 

 economic decline, we can expect political instability and 

 conflict.

 7.

 I know that the continuing integrity of the multilateral 

 system is a matter of concern in Africa. Africa has a 

 high refutation for its commitment to multilateral 

 approaches. As a region it has been outward looking and 

 active in multilateral diplomacy.  This is a tradition 

 which Australia shares and it provides an additional 

 dimension to the contact Australia has with this huge and 

 varied continent.

 We live in an increasingly interdependent world. This 

 makes international cooperation not just some pious ideal 

 but a necessity. Global environment problems like the 

 ozone layer or toxic waste disposal require global 

 solutions:  so do international health problems like AIDS,

 ot the international narcotics trade or unregulated 

 population flows, or those other unhappy phenomena being 

 increasingly referred to these days as "non military 

 threats to security". Australia and Africa have a role to 

 play in all these areas just as we do in other fields of 

 international action such as decolonisation, peacekeeping 

 and the whole arms control agenda.

 Australia is an Asia/Pacific nation and our immediate 

 foreign policy focus is understandably on our own region. 

 This is only sensible. But as an outward looking nation, 

 a nation dependent on overseas markets and a middle sized 

 power, we cannot afford to have an exclusively 

 Asia/Pacific focus. A global perspective is essential to 

 both our security and trading future and for this reason 

 Australia is also interested in expanding our political, 

 economic and humanitarian ties with other regions 

 including Africa. I of course recognise that Africa is a 

 continent rich in its diversity, defiant of 

 generalisations and that whatever modest extensions we 

 make to our relationship with it will require work at the 

 bilateral level. I hope my current visit to seven African 

 nations - a visit taken within the first six months of my 

 term as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade - can help 

 advance this process.

 8.

 Let me conclude by noting that Australia has had a happy 

 association with Nigeria since it attained independence in 

 1960. Many young Nigerians have completed tertiary 

 studies in Australia and we have welcomed the contribution 

 they have made to improving our understanding of each 

 other. They have impressed on us the irrepressible 

 vitality of your country.

 I would hope that as Australia and Africa look at ways to 

 broaden and deepen our relationship,  Australia - Nigeria 

 relations will be seen as a model:  an association founded

 on mutual respect and regard;  a developing partnership.
