 Media Release ­ Inverbrackie must not expand ­ Friday 14 October 2011 

 14 October 2011 in Media 

 

 Following the Gillard Government’s decision to abandon offshore processing, the Immigration Minister Chris Bowen  must recommit to his promise not expand the Inverbrackie detention facility beyond its current capacity.      

 After announcing the facility in October last year, Minister Bowen made a commitment to the community that it would  accommodate no more than 400 low-risk asylum seekers.      

 The Minister has also made further assurances through the media and in a letter to me that the facility would not  expand.      

 But the decision to abandon offshore processing is expected to drive an increase in unauthorised boat arrivals, which  will no doubt place pressure at existing detention centres like Inverbrackie.      

 In light of this, I have today written to the Immigration Minister asking him to reassure the local community by  re-committing to his promise not to expand the Inverbrackie facility.      

 After being poorly treated by a lack of consultation on the establishment of the facility, I believe the community  deserves to hear this re-commitment.      

 Any decision to expand the facility, especially after ruling it out on a number of occasions, would be a massive  breach of trust with his promise to the local community.
