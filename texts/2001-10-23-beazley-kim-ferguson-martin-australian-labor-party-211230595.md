 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview with Martin Ferguson, Shadow Minister for Regional Development, Transport and Infrastructure, Regional Services and Population Subjects: Labor's Plan For Australia's Infrastructure, Kyoto Agreement, Refugees, Relationship With Indonesia

 Transcript - Gladstone, Queensland - 23 October 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: What I am announcing today is Labor's long-term plan for the building of Australia's infrastructure. It's about taking from one of Labor's great successful schemes of long ago and the returns on that scheme, Ben Chifley's Snowy Mountain Scheme, and reinvesting it now in the nation's future - in money for roads, in money for ports, in money for the infrastructure - our general commercial infrastructure, rails. This is about ensuring Australian jobs and the building of the Australian nation.

 Some of these polices have already been announced in relation to regional development, in relation to what we're doing with aged care, in relation to what we're doing with hospitals and education.

 The policies that we're announcing today also pick up an equity injection for Australian rail. The development of our railway system, particularly the interface between rail, roads and ports, are going to be critical to secure the sorts of efficiencies that we need to create jobs down into the future.

 The Labor Party's campaign is about jobs, health, education. In our infrastructure proposals, we pick up all of it: jobs, health and education because they are indivisible in the end, at least in so far as they have a capital component.

 We are here with a realistic program. The money for it, as I said is, some of it, directly from the Budget, but a lot of it is from a re-investment of the repayment of Snowy Mountains loans.

 What a great thing it is to be able, in this amount of time, what, nearly 50 years on from the start of that

 Snowy Mountain Scheme, to be able to say that the benefit to the nation of that scheme continues. The opportunity to re-invest from that scheme continues. In re-investing, we are not going for the single big project, but what builds our capacity right around the country.

 JOURNALIST: In relation to the specific purpose payments you say here that Mr Howard will withdraw this money over time forcing the States to vote for an increase in the rate of GST if they wish to fund major infrastructure projects. Which of the five Labor States are you saying would vote for an increase in the GST rate?

 BEAZLEY: All the Labor States oppose any increase in the GST - and we oppose an increase in the GST. But I draw your attention to the original agreement with the States. There was a guarantee that the States would get the resources that they once had from the Financial Assistance Grants, no matter what the outcome in the amount raised by the GST was, they would definitely get that.

 But the Commonwealth left explicitly open what would happen to Special Purpose Payments. The Special Purpose Payments are Commonwealth Grants to the States for roads, for other aspects of the transport infrastructure, for education, for health, a whole range of areas that the Commonwealth engages in to the tune of some $17 billion or $18 billion a year.

 What is clear as a strategy from Mr Howard, who says that all these things are State matters: public hospitals, the issues of public schools, these are all State matters. What is amply clear is that down the years what is intended by Mr Howard is to reverse that whole agenda that developed in this nation in the 1970s. The States have got a financial resource - the financial resource is the goods and services tax, even though it's a Commonwealth levied tax. If they want more money for roads, if they want more money for schools, then they have to either put the GST on food, or raise the rate. That is John Howard's long-term agenda. There is no question about that. That's what that means.

 JOURNALIST: …for Labor colleagues in the State capitals could be persuaded by a Coalition Government to put up the rate of the GST?

 BEAZLEY: No, what you'd then get would be a fight. You'd get one of those unedifying fights that you get between the Commonwealth and the States and you've had forever. That's why we say: let's have a different relationship with the States. Let's use the Council of Australian Governments for us to jointly develop this nation - jointly to develop it in where we need to do so in education and in health, and, of course, in our roads and our general infrastructure.

 We are about partnership. We don't take that view that the Commonwealth steps back from these propositions. We take the view that the Commonwealth is in there in partnership with the States, and that all the resources of the Commonwealth, from the total revenue base, not just the GST, from the total revenue base is available for national development.

 JOURNALIST: Have the State Premiers given you guarantees they would never ever allow the GST rate to go up?

 BEAZLEY: The State Premiers point out that, of course, is a Commonwealth determination as to whether it goes up. But all our State Labor Premiers oppose the GST. They're obliged to act in concert with the Commonwealth when it imposed it on them. They oppose the GST. They don't want the rate to rise. More particularly, as evidence of their good faith, they're supporting what we're intending to so in rolling back the GST. That makes us poles apart from our Liberal opponents. They're prepared to accept

 us rolling back the GST and substituting instead Commonwealth funds directly to them because we don't live by this fiction that John Howard has developed and that is that all comes to the States in the future, be it for education, health, or whatever, comes through the goods and services tax. That is a recipe for raising the rate and imposing it on more things.

 JOURNALIST: Is it sensible to take these early repayments then go and loan them out again in what are worsening economic times. And when you envisage they would be paid back?

 BEAZLEY: It's actually a very good way to do it. Of course each of those loans would have different conditions attached to them except their common feature is that they will be low interest or no interest loans and therefore very attractive to the people who acquire them. But they'd have different schedules in terms of repayment. I think the times in which we live, which have a combination of some concerns for employment, unemployment has been rising, but at the same time, continuing Budget surpluses that you don't want to diminish, or that you don't want to eliminate for other reasons, you want to keep the Budget in surplus when you've got a combination of those two pressures, jobs on the one hand, responsible economic management on the other. This is a very good way through.

 It's also good leverage because what we're talking about here is not just the Commonwealth putting in a contribution, these loans go to people who are accessing private sector money, or State Government money, or Local Government money. So, you're getting much more bang for the buck on the road that we're intending to pursue here. So, yes, I think it's a very sensible point of time.

 This is probably exactly the right point of time for us to be talking about using the repayments from the Snowy Mountains arrangements to re-invest in loans, that because it leverages other amounts of money from other sources into infrastructure development, can kick start again jobs growth without blowing the Budget.

 JOURNALIST: …judgement call that this particular circumstance it's more sensible and more practical to responsibly re-invest these funds rather than to retire debt. Where does that leave you on the national debt and at what rate would you retire it…..

 BEAZLEY: This Government inherited, no matter what it says, about the fourth or fifth best debt position in the industrialised world. It has now the second best debt position. The impact of all this on that is marginal. It has a marginal impact on a good debt position. The point is the impact on the Budget. As a result of this, there is some effect on public debt interest obligations on the Commonwealth. But it is a small effect, that public debt impact, small compared with the massive benefit that goes to the community by re-investment of these loans.

 JOURNALIST: …pork barrelling or that they were skewed to marginal seats for political reasons. What guarantees are there or protections that you won't use the fund in that way?

 FERGUSON: Go to the detail. One of the primary recommendations in this report is about the establishment on an Infrastructure Advisory Council recommended by all the groups in the Australian community who are vitally concerned with infrastructure development. Take a professional engineers audit over the last two years, it has established a huge backlog on the infrastructure front, be it water, sewage, roads, ports, railway or whatever. You name it on the infrastructure front, the time has come for Australia to actually invest in its infrastructure of the future, which in turn then creates further opportunities for the private sector to invest in those regions. That in turn builds training and job opportunities.

 When it comes to avoiding pork barrelling, I am clearly committed to making sure this Infrastructure Advisory Council works, that we start to determine our priorities as a nation on the basis of need, rather than the Anderson approach of fly in, fly out, a little bit of pork barrelling here and there and no real commitment to regional development.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Ferguson, you say that the Sydney port is jammed. Any plans to fund the reopening of the rail vent from Dubbo to the port of Newcastle?

 FERGUSON: I'll tell you what we're about firstly: implementing an independent report, an audit report to the Australian Railtrack Corporation. We need $500 million. Today we are committing another $60 million, which means that there is $215 million now on the table. Unfortunately, $155 million of that has been sitting there for a couple of years because the Minister for Transport has been unable, or unwilling, to actually free up the access problems for the Sydney port area. We are committing to a deadline of March. In addition to that, we are now going to kick-start that audit report implementation to get on with rail freight where we left off in 1996. That's in turn very important to transport in general in Australia today because we are moving beyond operators being interested one section of the transport industry, such as … (inaudible) …, historically a trucking company, now being one of the bidders of the national rail corporation. The whole nature of transport in Australia is changing. This is about taking it forward. I'd also say it's smart on the greenhouse front, too.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the economist, Peter Brain says that it's nonsense for political parties to base their promises on the four year estimates and voters can expect a series of broken promises. Will this happen under you?

 BEAZLEY: No, it won't. The point about those four-year estimates, forward estimates, is that they are conservative. We are operating within that framework. The fact of the matter is we have no other framework in which to operate. In the old days you'd operate off the Budget four-year estimates.

 The changes that were put in place by this Government means that you operate off the four year estimates that are revealed during the course of the election campaign. If you're going to have a disciplined debate in this country, you absolutely have to operate from the same ground rules. You have to assign your priorities from within that framework.

 We've been announcing things that effectively amount to savings. We've also been announcing where we intend to spend and how we intend to do it. We're doing a bit more of that today.

 We have no alternative but to do exactly what it is that we are doing. But we are also keeping things modest. We're not about breaking the bank. We have been highly targeted, and criticised for it, I might say, in some circles, but we have been highly targeted on people's most basic needs, things that folk have identified to us as significant. Then finding ways to match responsible fiscal policy to those needs.

 That's what we've been doing. I think we've been doing it with some success in this election campaign and we're keeping on doing it. We are, as you are, in a position where we simply have to trust those figures that we've been provided by Treasury.

 JOURNALIST: …Snowy scheme, so you see that as being augmented by further asset sales or loan repayments in the future? Or is that the extent of what you're working…funding terms at the moment?

 BEAZLEY: That's the extent of what we're working with. But you also notice, of course, included in this

 infrastructure program we are rolling into it other elements of our infrastructure spend that comes directly off the Budget, or as the result of a direct agreement with the States, so there's some matters in there for schools, about defence equipment and the like, which clearly relate to things which we've already committed from the Budget, or from new money and we're trying to present to here both a picture of what we intend to do with the Snowy Mountains repayments, and also a picture of what we intend to do about infrastructure over all. It's not just about what comes from the Snowy Mountains, what you've got before you.

 JOURNALIST: ….build an aluminium refinery…they've been asking for some Federal Government subsidies. Do you have a view on the merits of that?

 BEAZLEY: I've heard that that is a proposition. While I'm not sure that we would exactly fit any of these particular propositions here to the generality of what it is that Alcoa is doing. One of the points of the regional development programs that we have, related to infrastructure, and seeking to tease out commercial investment via that process, it is available for commercial operations with infrastructure requirements to ensure that they go ahead. That's not necessarily direct assistance. But it certainly puts an amount of money in the way of local authorities and others which are negotiating with commercial interests, so that if there is a specific piece of infrastructure that may well help a commercial proposition to go ahead, then these monies are available for that.

 JOURNALIST: How many jobs do you have in mind…..

 BEAZLEY: We're not putting a figure on that. If you look at the diversity infrastructure proposals here, it would be very difficult to put a figure on it. Suffice it to say, that unless we're actually investing like this, the jobs picture is going to go backwards in this country. It has been going backwards now since the GST was put in place. It's foreshadowed in Costello's latest figures to go backwards further.

 What we need, both in terms of long-term nation building, and short-term kick-start to get jobs growing again, are projects like these.

 JOURNALIST: ….Gladstone is one of the key industrial places here in Queensland…Comalco refinery being proposed. What do you plan to do to help Gladstone….?

 BEAZLEY: These propositions help Gladstone. These regional development propositions are classically directed towards towns which are enterprising, towns which have an industrial base to start with that can be built upon. Gladstone would be sitting down looking through these sorts of schemes. I'm sure, from what I know about the local authorities here, they never miss a chance.

 JOURNALIST: …jobs…ratify the Kyoto Protocol, especially in a place where aluminium and such….

 BEAZLEY: It certainly is not true. What we have said about ratifying the Kyoto agreement - you ratify the Kyoto agreement, you get the chance to lay the ground rules. You get a chance to devise the criteria by which it's establish, what priority you assign the trading emissions credits, carbon credits. You set the regime about what is met by carbon sinks. You stay in the game.

 One of the things that we're determined to do, because we're a coal exporting nation, but the great thing about Australian coal is that it is amongst the cleanest on the globe and Australian science is making it cleaner. One of the reasons, and I think, in fact the $30 million is in this report, one of the reasons we've put down a system of loans, businesses that are engaged in getting their act together on greenhouse

 emissions, is that we know that Australian business can cut it. We know that the clean coal technology that we are getting in place in this country, and scientifically researching, gives us a leg-up in the long-term for continuing our coal exports while, at the same time, meeting our targets. This is a situation which Australia must actively engage if we're going to be leaders and not victims. That's our purpose.

 JOURNALIST: So, is the Aluminium Council wrong when they say that thousands of jobs could go offshore….

 BEAZLEY: I think the Aluminium Council, if indeed they said that, has taken some time to catch up with the propositions that we made, because that's not what the coal people said.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 BEAZLEY: And the coal people said, when we put out our proposition on Kyoto, welcomed it because they know what we're on about here. They know what we're trying to do here. We're trying to ensure that our environment is protected and so are Australian jobs.

 If you're in the business of working out the terms and conditions on which carbon credit trading takes place, you win. But if you're not in the game, you don't work out the conditions. That's as simple as that. We're about staying in the game.

 JOURNALIST: Have you not explained your message properly then because people like Comalco, one of Australia's largest Aluminium producers….

 BEAZLEY: They know very well, and they should know, that if you get your carbon emissions credit trading regime right, they can stand to benefit from operations that are conducted from here. But you're not going to get that right if you're not in the business. That's the first point I make. The second point is, you actually do have to deal with these things. You actually do have to deal with the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. The trick for an Australian Government, being big exporters of coal, and being big producers of things like aluminium, if this is a problem that's not going to go away, this is an issue which now will increasingly dominate international relationships globally. You can either win, or you can become a victim. What this Government is there setting us to do is to be a victim, rather than a winner. Our propsotions are to make Australia a winner. The problem won't go away, but the problem can be dealt with by Australia in a way that advantages us in terms of jobs, as well as meeting some environmental targets that simply all of us have to meet.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, just on another issue. John Howard's spoken out over comments related this morning about the boats … boat people … Do you stand by your statement when you said events surrounding that incident point towards a failure of government policy.

 BEAZLEY: I don't need John Howard to twist my words. I've already dealt with his twisting of my words in the debate and he is twisting my words again on this occasion. The people who are responsible for the deaths of those people are those who conduct that evil trade. They are responsible for their deaths, those folk.

 Now, we've supported Howard on every piece of policy that he has put in place in relation to dealing with that, and the naval patrols. They're not enough, they're not enough. Still the people keep coming. They still keep coming. If we're going to stop this evil trade in which we've seen this evil trade produce this human tragedy today - it produces a human tragedy off the coast of Java, in the Java Seas, and it

 produces a security problem here in Australia when the boats don't sink but they do get through - if we're going to stop that, we have to have more than what Howard's doing.

 We support what John Howard's doing but we've got to have more than what John Howard's doing. We need a proper Coast Guard. It's not good enough to be repainting naval oceanographic ships and sending them off as patrol boats. We actually need a straightforward Coast Guard and the weak, wishy-washy alternative to it that John Howard is putting out today is merely a concession that we are right on that subject and he is wrong.

 What we also need is a regional agreement with Indonesia. Why is John Howard up there after his failed meeting at APEC still talking about, 'well, I can still talk to Megawati about these matters, I can still talk to Megawati and I must talk to her after the next election'. Of course he knows that we are right when we say that that's what has to be done.

 JOURNALIST: … any idea of what … political point scoring over this tragedy…

 BEAZLEY: He is twisting my words for base political purposes and it's not an unusual manoeuvre for him. As I pointed out during the debate, he twisted our words and our position on the Tampa legislation and he's twisting our words again on this occasion. What we have here is a human tragedy and the human tragedy is caused by an evil trade. We've supported Howard on every proposition he's put forward to deal with that evil trade and still they come. In some instances, that means they sink offshore and die. In other instances, it means they come into our area and give considerable trouble of course to our officials in handling them. We have got to stop this. The way to stop this is to get in place a decent border protection force, and a regional agreement that includes a bilateral arrangement with Australia and Indonesia.

 Now, John Howard knows this. He's knows he's failed at APEC. And, having failed at APEC, what he seeks now to do is to completely illegitimately twist my words - absolutely illegitimately twist my words - and he is in the business, John Howard, not of conveying our policies accurately but of getting himself into a position to get out of trouble that is of his own making in this area.

 JOURNALIST: Do you … representation or misrepresentation as you see it from now on…

 BEAZLEY: I think you can guarantee that John Howard will misrepresent everything I say on these matters. He has form. Now, we dealt with that misrepresentation in the debate and I'm dealing with this misrepresentation here again today. He knows we supported him on all his laws. He knows we supported him on putting the Navy out there even though we think neither of these constitute a long-term solution. What is amply clear is that the solution is not yet there. What is even more clear - by his own manoeuvring - the next phase of the solution requires a Coast Guard and the further phase of the solution requires an agreement in the region - which means these people stop coming here. When these people stop coming here then we'll get ourselves in a position where we've got a bit of a sense of security in this country.

 JOURNALIST: …reacting to today's polls…

 BEAZLEY: I cannot go to his motivation for twisting my words except that it's his form. He is a noted twister of our words on these immigration matters and he is not breaking stride today or taking a different position today, he's just still on the job. He's still on the job of twisting our words and twisting our position when he knows darn well that we have supported him on all his legislation and he knows darn well that his legislation is not enough. He knows that, above all. He came back from APEC having failed

 fundamentally to advance the protection of our borders in terms of our relationships with Indonesia -failed fundamentally protecting our borders in terms of advancing our relationships with Indonesia. He's trying to find any means out of having that exposed and discussed in this country.

 JOURNALIST: … couple of areas ... What would you do … relationship with Indonesia and …

 BEAZLEY: Immediately upon forming a government, we will start the process of discussion with Indonesia. Laurie Brereton and relevant Ministers would go there to open up our agenda in relation to an agreement which sees people properly processed through Indonesian camps, in relation to the establishment of a special envoy - we'd appoint that person immediately - to start getting in place regional arrangements. What we see is the tip of an iceberg.

 We see these evil people putting onboard boats of great unseaworthiness and sending them in our direction, we see that but those same people in South East Asia are organising piracy, they're organising illicit drug movements, they're organising gun running, they are part of a total security agenda and problem in South East Asia. We used to be a leading country in putting forward security perspectives in this region. In the old days, when one of us stood up who happened to be Defence Minister or Foreign Minister, it was my experience as Defence Minister, and made a statement about South East Asian security matters, everybody in the region took notice. Now, that doesn't happen now. But it can happen again. So, what we'd be doing immediately is within effectively that first fortnight of us being in office we'd have Laurie Brereton and team paving the way. We'd have an envoy in place, we'd start the process. In the interim, we're stuck with John Howard's solutions but we know that John Howard's solutions are not enough, we've got to do more.

 JOURNALIST: … of the Howard Government in respect of the boat people. Aren't you implying then that then Howard Government takes some blame or responsibility for what has actually happened?

 BEAZLEY: I am talking about Howard policy failure across the board but more particularly, I'm talking about Howard misrepresentation. Understand this: this is Howard misrepresentation, misrepresenting me. The people who are responsible for this horror are the criminals who organise the trade. They are the people responsible for this horror. And we've supported every measure, in terms of dealing with the protection of our borders, against what these people are up to - every measure that Howard's put in place, but it's not enough.

 JOURNALIST: … Howard Government carries no blame at all for what …

 BEAZLEY: Howard has been misrepresenting the things that I have said - absolutely misrepresenting me. Howard's job and my job is to stop it. That's Howard's job and it's my job. Now, we have supported all Howard's measures to stop it but Howard's measures aren't working. And therefore we need more. What we need, of course, is proper patrolling of the borders and we need that agreement. It's as simple as that.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

 BEAZLEY: We have to sit down and talk these issues through with the Indonesians. We've got to stop the megaphone diplomacy with the Indonesians. We have got to get down to a solution with the Indonesians. That's what we've got to get with the Indonesians - a solution. That is way beyond John Howard's misrepresentations in this particular instance, or apparently his capacity at APEC.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

 BEAZLEY: The solution to these problems lies in our relationship with the Indonesians. That's where it lies. What John Howard has engaged in today is a misrepresentation, like the previous misrepresentation he did which I exposed during the debate - he's engaged in that to take attention away from the fact that he cannot achieve the major solution. He can't even begin to get into the business of achieving the main solution. Now, we have gone through the processes supporting him on everything, supporting him on all his bills, supporting him on his patrol, all of it. We've supported him on everything. The question's got to be asked: if they're still coming, why? And the answer is crystal clear, the answer is the relationship with Indonesia.

 Now, the fact that John Howard was desperately trying to cobble together a meeting at APEC - and failed - is fair example of the fact that he knows and understands that ultimately the solution lies in what we can talk through with them. He also knows this - or he should have learned it by now - he won't do that by finger wagging or blame-shifting, he'll only do it, or taking a megaphone to it, he'll only do it by sitting down, presenting the problem as a regional problem, presenting a solution that will work and presenting a picture of our mutual interests, in our mutual security, in seeking a successful outcome. That's how you do it. These things have been done before. We're not here, if you like, in a vacuum or in territory which has never been patrolled or has never been walked over in times past. We are dealing with problems, the solutions of which are known. The question is, the capacity to organise a solution.

 JOURNALIST: Why is changing Foreign Minister going to make any difference to our relationship with Indonesia. They want money they want some way of getting these people off their own territory. What is your solution to that?

 BEAZLEY: A change in approach. That's what we need. That's what we're offering. If you go through the policies that we've put forward you'll see a carefully staged set of proposals which relate to all these issues that you raised, including the financial ones, including the processing issues, all of those are laid out for you in our policies. The question is motivation and we can see more of that today. I'm motivated by a desire to protect our borders, by desire to secure a successful outcome, I'm motivated by that. John Howard is motivated by a desire to twist my words, for his own political purposes in the same way he that twisted my words and actions on Tampa. Now, we exposed one lot of that. We'll expose another lot of it today. Thanks very much.
