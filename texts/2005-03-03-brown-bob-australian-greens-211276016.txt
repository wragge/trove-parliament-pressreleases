 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania 

 Government Immigration Shemozzle 

 3rd March 2005 

 The Howard Government’s failure to adequately fund public education  including TAFE has left Australia short of skilled workers, Greens  Senator Bob Brown said today.    

 “The Howard policy of diversion of funding to private education rather  than catering for plumbers, electricians and welders has failed,”  Senator Brown said.    

 “The first place Amanda Vanstone should look for skilled workers is  amongst the thousands of men and women holding temporary  protection visas who desperately want to contribute to this nation.    

 “Australia’s immigration policy is a costly shemozzle,” Senator Brown  said.
