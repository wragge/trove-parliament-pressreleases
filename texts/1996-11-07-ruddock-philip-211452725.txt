 OPPOSITION AND DEMOCRATS SUBSIDISE MILLIONAIRES

 The Labor Party, Democrats and independents have decided that millionaires should  be subsidised for English language tuition, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 "The decision by Labor and others in the Senate to disallow a Regulation on the migrant  education charge, means that millionaire migrants will have their tuition costs  subsidised by thousands of dollars each," Mr Ruddock said.

 "By disallowing the Regulation to move towards full cost recovery, Labor, the Democrats  and the independents have handed the Australian taxpayer a $25-million bill over the  next four years."

 "With the financial mess inherited from Labor, you have to set priorities and our priority  was to increase expenditure on settlement services and require that skilled migrants  who have human and economic capital, pay their own way."

 "You would have to ask whether Labor really cares when it is quite happy for the  taxpayer to subsidise millionaires."

 "The move towards full cost recovery was a clear election commitment from the  Coalition, but the Democrats have decided not to let us keep that commitment. I would  have to question their claim to be keeping Government honest."

 The English tuition charge applies to the skilled categories and to the skills-linked  Concessional Family category where a migrant or their family does not have functional  English.

 There is no charge for Preferential Family migrants or for people arriving under the  Refugee and Humanitarian streams.
