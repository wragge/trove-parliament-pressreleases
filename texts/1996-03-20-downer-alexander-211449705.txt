  BURMA BORDERS -AusAID REFUGEE RELIEF 

  1ft,. -tl, AUSTRALIA ,J "~>$)~(Â´<

  I am aware of reports about alleged ill-treatment of returning Burmese refugees, including  today's report from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) and I will be  considering the material ACFOA and others have gathered. 

  It is beyond doubt that there remains an urgent humanitarian need in the Burmese border  refugee camps. 

  I am pleased to announce that AusAID, the Australian Government's aid agency, is providing  a further $2 million package of assistance to Burmese refugees living on the borders of  Thailand and Bangladesh. 

  This package will help meet the basic needs of refugees. 

  On the Thai-Burma border an estimated 90,000 people have found sanctuary in 18 camps.  Since the military staged coup and establishment of the State Law and Order Restoration  Council (SLORC) in 1988, thousands of indigenous Karen and Mon people have fled to  Thailand in fear for their safety. 

  There are still 55,000 Rohingya people living along Burma's border with Bangladesh. AusAID  recognises that these people are in need of such basics as clean water. As well, work in  immunising mothers and children must continue. 

  AusAID's grants are to be provided to key relief organisations operating in the areas. 

  In Thailand, the National Council of Churches will receive $844,000 to support the Burma  Border Consortium (BBC) which coordinates relief supplies to the camps. A further  $156,000 will go to Austcare to support medical programs provided by Medicins Sans  Frontieres (MSF) . 

  In Bangladesh, a grant of$500,000 will go to the World Food Programme for feeding and  rehabilitation programs for the Rohingya refugees. A second grant of $500,000 will go to the  UNICEF Committee of Australia for their Universal Child Immunisation Program in Rakhine  State.
