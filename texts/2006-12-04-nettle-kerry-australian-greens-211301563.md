 Vanstone thinks 5 yrs imprisonment on Nauru is a 'success' 

 Senator Nettle, 4th December 2006   

 Immigration Minister Senator Vanstone admitted in Senate Question Time today that  the five year imprisonment of refugee Mohammed Sagar in Nauru represents a  'successful resolution' for the Department of Immigration.    

 Senator Nettle questioned Senator Vanstone over the future of Mohammed Sagar's  friend Mohammed Faisal who was recently evacuated from Nauru to receive  treatment in a Brisbane psychiatric hospital and to fate of the 8 Burmese refugees now  remaining on Nauru.    

 "Its appalling and embarrassing that Sweden has had to step in and rescue Mr Sagar  after Australia left him stranded on Nauru for over five years," Senator Nettle said.    

 "The Minister refused to indicate whether the final Tampa refugee Mr Mohammed  Faisal who is currently in a Brisbane psychiatric hospital will be given a visa to  remain in Australia.  

 

 "To describe as a 'successful resolution' the mercy act of Sweden to save Mr Sagar  just shows the warped approach that this government brings to dealing with refugees.    

 "It is appalling that the Minister labels 5 year of cruel abandonment in Nauru as a  success.    

 "There are still seven Burmese refugees in detention on Nauru who are now suffering  the same fate of indefinite imprisonment in a strange land which left Mr Faisal in  psychiatric care.    

 "The Government must put an end to the 'Pacific Solution' and stop relying on the  compassion of other countries to take care of Australia's responsibilities."
