 1987-88 GRANTS-IN-AID FOR MIGRANT WELFARE SERVICES   ANNOUNCED .

 The Minister for i m m igration, Local Government and :

 Ethnic A f f a i r s , Mick Y o u n g , today announced awards for   1987-88 under .the Federal Government's Grant-in-Aid Scheme.

 A total of 74.5 grants .have been awar d e d , including eight   available for the first time this y e a r . ·  â   -

 Mr Young said the latest awards bring the total number of   grants under the Scheme to 209 A u stralia-wide, with a   total annual value of $7.25 million.

 "The Scheme aims to help non-Government o r ganisations,   including ethnic community g r o u p s , to set up and operate   welfare-related services for m i g rants," the Minister said.

 "The grants assist in three ways:

 . by helping migrants to make full use of general

 community resources

 . by providing services which are unlikely to

 be offered by general community organisations and   which aim to overcome problems specifically related   to m i g r a n t s , and

 . by developing the structures of ethnic communities

 in order to help their members express their needs   and take action to meet them. .

 "The Scheme is another practical expression of the.   Government's access and equity program which seeks to   ensure that all necessary services are available and   accessible to migrants".

 Mr Young said interest in the Scheme had again been high   with more than 200 applications for the available grants.
