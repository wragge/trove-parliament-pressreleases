 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It’s good to be here at Davidson Rural Fire Brigade to help announce the World Firefighter Games coming  to Sydney. I am a proud participant in the Games and I’m looking forward to being part of the team. I’m not  sure that we’re going to be the fastest competitors but certainly we’ll be, I hope, able to give a good account 

 of ourselves in those Games. It’s good that they’re coming to Sydney and it’s good that the Rural Fire  Service and the State Emergency Services are going to be very heavily involved.    

 As an occasional emergency services volunteer, I am acutely conscious of the tragedy that is unfolding off  Christmas Island. This is simply a tragedy. It is a ghastly, deadly example of what can happen when we have  illegal boats coming to Australia. There will be plenty of time in the days ahead to canvass the policy issues  that this event has raised; suffice to say that at the moment we continue to grieve everyone who has lost their  lives in this terrible tragedy and obviously we offer our full support to the naval and other personnel that are  doing their best in the search and rescue effort.    

 Finally, on a lighter note, let me just say that Black Caviar is racing in England tonight and the hopes of all  Australia ride on her.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mal Washer said that both parties are responsible for the political impasse. Do you think it’s time for both  parties to sit down and talk about these issues?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think it’s important that we effectively deal with the problem. I think that’s important. The Coalition  has had policies announced for a long time now. Essentially, they’re the policies that worked under the  Howard Government. Now, I am all in favour of talking to everyone who needs to be spoken to but in the  end, what’s important here are effective policies, not necessarily bipartisan policies.    

 QUESTION:  

 1 

 

 2 

 

 

 Have you approached or been approached by the Government to talk about the asylum seeker policy since  Thursday night’s events?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 There has been no approach to the best of my knowledge from the Government.    

 QUESTION:    

 Are you willing to compromise with the Government on border protection?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The important thing is to have effective policies. The important thing is to have policies which do actually  stop the boats. Now, I believe that the Coalition has effective polices. Certainly, they were effective under  the Howard Government and that’s what matters. What matters here is putting the right policies in place, not  talking endlessly about what they might be.    

 QUESTION:    

 So, is that a no to compromise?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, as I said, the important thing is not to have policies which are bipartisan. The important thing is to  have policies which are effective. That’s what we need here. We need effective polices to stop the boats  because if the boats keep coming, the tragedies keep happening and that’s the tragic truth of the terrible  situation that is unfolding in the waters to the north of Australia.    

 QUESTION:    

 Some of your backbenchers have suggested a different approach though, in particular the Malaysia Solution.  Will you pull them into line?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The Coalition has got policies which everyone is familiar with. There’s no need to run through them again  now, but they are essentially the policies which worked under the Howard Government. We’ve had them for  a decade. I recommitted the Coalition to those policies at the beginning of my time as the leader. Everyone  knows what they are. I think they can work in the future as they have worked in the past.    

 QUESTION:    

 We’ve got up to 90 people still missing. It’s an unfolding tragedy. Do you think we should be politicising  these events while they’re still unfolding?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I am doing my best to avoid that. I am absolutely doing my best to avoid that. Not a word of criticism  of the Government will escape my lips today. The fact of the matter is we should today be grieving for those  who are lost and doing what we can to support those who are involved in the rescue and recovery effort.   

 QUESTION:  

 3 

 

 

 When Julia Gillard comes back, are you willing to sit down and talk then?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, as I said, the important thing is to have the right policies - that’s the important thing. It doesn’t really  matter whether Julia Gillard and I talk about this. What matters is that the Government put the right policies  in place and that’s what should happen.    

 QUESTION:    

 Greg Hunt earlier released a media statement saying that the PM has failed to win support in Rio for the  carbon tax. Now, given that Ban Ki-Moon has actually commended the carbon tax, how do you feel about  that?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 This again has been just another environmental talkfest. We’ve had so many environmental talkfests but  concrete action has been pretty hard to find. Now, a lot of countries are taking sensible steps forward along  the lines recommended by the Coalition. We are going to plant more trees, we are going to get better soils,  we are going to use smarter technology. This is the way to reduce emissions and more and more these are  the strategies that other countries are using to get their emissions down. What is crystal clear as a result of  the Rio conference is that Australia’s carbon tax is an international orphan. No other countries are going  down the path of an economy-wide carbon tax.     

 QUESTION:    

 The Commonwealth is alleging that James Ashby may have leaked the diary of Peter Slipper to Mal Brough.  How do you feel about that?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 There’s only one thing that really matters here. Did or did not Mr Slipper sexually harass a staffer? Now,  that’s the only thing that matters. That’s now before the courts and let’s see what conclusion the courts come  to.  

 

 Thank you.
