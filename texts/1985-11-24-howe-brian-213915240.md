 Minister for  Social Security

 BLH 74/85  24 November 1985

 NATIONAL POLICY ON LANGUAGE SERVICES

 The Department of Social Security has adopted a national policy  on language services, formally stating its intention to provide  services in languages other than English to clients not  competent in English.

 Announcing this today, the Minister for Social Security, Brian Howe, said he believed his was the first Commonwealth  Government department to adopt such a policy.

 Mr Howe said that by providing services in languages familiar  to individual clients, his department would be helping to break  â¢  down a major obstacle to equity and social justice.

 "Government structures must be made more accessible to ethnic  communities", Mr Howe said.

 "In terms of my department, attaining a welfare payment to  alleviate hardship and need is not something that can be done  in a vacuum.

 "Obstacles such as language barriers must be taken into  account, and action taken to remove them."

 Mr Howe said action to be taken - or already taken - by his  department to improve access and equity for migrants included:

 - increasing the number of full-time bilingual counter  officers and part-time interpreters in local regional  offices;

 - fitting all regional offices with one or more  dual-handset telephones for clients wishing to contact  the Telephone Interpreter Service;

 2

 - publishing leaflets on Social Security pensions,   benefits and allowances in eleven ‘major'community  languages, including Italian, Greek, Polish, Arabic,  Vietnamese and Turkish;

 - publishing glossaries of 1  Social Security terms' in a  number of languages;

 - establishing of a national translation unit in the  department's central office in Canberra to translate  publicity and information material;

 - developing of a staffing policy to ensure the special needs of ethnic communities are taken fully into  account in the recruitment, deployment and training of  DSS staff. -

 Mr Howe said it was estimated that 12 percent of Australia's  population had been born in non-English speaking countries.

 "Of particular note is the estimate that more than 20 percent  of all my department's clients are from non-English speaking  backgrounds.

 "This disproportionate representation is indicative of the  cultural barriers and discrimination which many migrants face",  Mr Howe said.

 "People from non-English speaking backgrounds, particularly  refugees and recent arrivals, are more likely to be unemployed  or in lower paid jobs, more likely to be living in poverty.

 "In the 1981 Census, one in every ten overseas-born aged people  reported that they'd had no income in their previous twelve  months, compared with one in twenty-five Australian-born  citizens in the same age group.

 "My department therefore has a special responsibility to  provide services for people who do not speak English, because  lack of fluency is in itself one of the major reasons why  people are likely to need our help in the first place",  Mr Howe 

 said. .
