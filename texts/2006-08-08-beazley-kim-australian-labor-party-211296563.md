 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 8 AUGUST 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:   Broadband;  Interest  rates; Afghanistan asylum seekers;  Newspoll; Middle East conflict; Asylum seeker laws   

 BEAZLEY:  Firstly a thing or two about broadband.  This is  incompetence built on ineptitude by the Howard Government.  We ought to be in  the information superhighway, instead this Government is leaving us in an IT  goat track.  We should be on the information superhighway and the Government  leaves us on an IT goat track.  This is the ball game - this is the infrastructure ball  game - broadband.  If we do not have high speed broadband in this country all  our business will be at a competitive disadvantage.  If we do not have it, it means  our kids miss out on massive learning opportunities.     

 Now, the Labor Party has put forward a proposition here whereby we use the  money currently allocated to one of the National Party’s many slush funds and  put that instead into a serious investment that benefits everybody in the city and  in the bush.  That is the way to go.  That would produce an outcome here.  But  this is a complete disaster which the Howard Government cannot permit to  persist.  They cannot leave us trundling along on an IT goat track when the rest  of the world is on an information superhighway.     

 Now, there are one or two other issues around of course.  We’ve got this  completely out of touch Government.  They spend more time suppressing the  words of their dissident MP’s than they do fixing the problems of the Australian  people.  They are so out of touch that they think what has effectively amounted to  three quarters of a per cent rise in interest rates since the election, since Howard  promised to keep interest rates at record lows, has no effect on people at all.   They just do not care.  Well it’s prices up.  It’s interest rates up.  It’s petrol up and  it’s wages down for ordinary middle Australians under the regime of the Howard  Government.  We need an economically, responsible alternative to this  Government and we’ve got one now in the Labor Party.  We have the ideas to  deal with these problems from broadband through to alternative sources of  petrol.  Time for a change.   

 JOURNALIST: Would you call on the Government to actually take the reins  in terms of broadband upgrades and fund it themselves?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well leverage with their own funding that’s what we’ve  suggested.  Take the slush fund that they’ve set aside in communications for the  National Party, which isn’t spent, use that to leverage broadband around the  country.  It’s vastly more useful for the bush, vastly more useful for metropolitan  Australia than anything that that slush fund would produce at the moment.  And  that would be sufficient to leverage Telstra in, in price terms, to doing the job.     

 Understand this: if this is done and we get that 15 fold increase in the speed of  broadband, we will have caught up with Slovenia.  Nobody’s asking here for any  revolutionary change that’s going to put Australia at the cutting edge.  Howard  has sent us backwards.  We are now backwards in telecommunications.  We are  hovering between First World and Third World in telecommunications and indeed  there’s many places in the Third World with faster broadband than we’ve got.     

 Now, this is completely impermissible.  One of the problems you’ve got is  because the technology is so complex it’s often harder for people to comprehend  the meaning of things here.  But the meaning of this is clear; the meaning of this  is competitive disadvantage for Australia.     

 You’ve got a useless Minister and a complacent Prime Minister he doesn’t  understand what he’s handling here.  The trouble is Howard looks backwards to  the last century.  That’s what Costello accused him of in his aborted run against  him.  He looks backwards to the last century and not forwards to where we need  to be now.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, should the Immigration Minister investigate  claims that up to nine asylum seekers may have died or been killed after been  sent back to Afghanistan?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well yes, of course.  I mean if anybody comes forward with  credible information on that sort of thing which casts light on the validity of  decision making, any prudent department should look at these things.  We ought  not to send people back if they’re at serious risk of harm - that is the essence of  a legitimate claim as to your refugee status.  So, the Minister should be  concerned about that and ought to take a look at it.  That’s why I think it’s  sensible that when people come via one means or another into our hands we put  them in a place like Christmas Island which operates under the international, not  the Australian migration regime, but nevertheless is properly administered by  Australia.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, just a quick one on Newspoll, it shows today  that Labor’s in front but most voters don’t believe that Labor is going to win the  next election.  What do you think about that and how do you change that  perception?   

 BEAZLEY:  We’ve been competitive for a long time in the polls.  I don’t  comment on the polls any further than that except to say this:  I think, gradually  people are beginning to recognise they’ve got an economically, responsible  alternative to this Government.  It’s another 12 months or so before the next  election which is when they will really make up their minds.  But I’m pleased that  there seems to be now a persistent perception developing that the Labor Party  has the ideas.  The Labor Party is focused on what’s happening around the  kitchen table to ordinary Australians and their pay and the petrol prices and the  prices generally.  And that the Government can be safely changed when the time  comes.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, just finally on the situation in Lebanon, do you  think that the Government’s position has been appropriate given that it’s been  such a fierce advocate of democracy in Iraq and yet not calling for an immediate  ceasefire against a democratically elected government?   

 BEAZLEY:  They’ve got to be more generous in terms of what they’re  prepared to provide in assistance from our Aid Budget to the rebuilding of  Lebanon once the conflict is over.  There was a hopeful development this  morning I thought when the Lebanese Government said that they’d be prepared  to deploy 15,000 troops in that area and Israel.  The Israeli spokesman seem to  be responding to that.  Obviously questions asked about what that means in  disarming Hezbollah.  Quite frankly the essence of a sovereign state is a  monopoly of violence.  Now that has not been achieved in Iraq and it’s not been  achieved in Lebanon.  That’s the starting point of workable democracy.   

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible) on the asylum seeker laws, what do you think will  come of (inaudible)   

 BEAZLEY:  I think if the Liberals sensibly vote with us they will find that  they’ve effectively protected our borders, not disgraced us internationally by  collapsing in the face of somebody else’s pressure and we’ll look tough and in  control of affairs.  All you simply need to do is cross the floor and sit with the  Labor Party and you’ll uphold Australian sovereignty and nationalism.
