 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MRS. SOPHIE MIRABELLA MHR,   SHADOW MINISTER FOR INNOVATION, INDUSTRY AND SCIENCE  AND MR. JASON WOOD, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR LA TROBE,  

 BEACONSFIELD, MELBOURNE 

 

 Subjects: The Coalition’s Real Solutions for Australia; Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; the Coalition's $1.5  billion commitment to Melbourne's East West Link; the Government's failed border protection policies;  western Sydney; WestConnex; the Gillard Government's budget cuts to Victorian hospitals.    

 EO&E........................................................................................................................................... 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It’s terrific to be here in Beaconsfield with our candidate, Jason Wood. It’s great to be with Sophie  Mirabella. Sophie is a working mum. Jason has lived in this part of outer metropolitan Melbourne all his  life.    

 It’s very important to try to relate to the forgotten families of middle Australia. There are so many people  who are doing it tough right now - they really are doing it tough - and they need hope and confidence that  there can be a better government in Canberra.     

 Now, as I’ve been saying for months now, as my shadow ministers and candidates have been saying for  months now, we have Real Solutions to the problems of Australia. We can’t solve every problem overnight,  but we can make a difference from day one. We can help with cost of living pressure by taking away the  carbon tax. We can help with transport problems by building the modern infrastructure that our cities need,  like the East West Link here in Melbourne. We can help to make our streets and our communities safer with  our programme to get the proceeds of crime back into helping people with CCTV and better lighting in  crime hotspots.     

 So, these are the positive plans that we’ve got for the people of Australia. This is the change for the better  that we promise should there be a change of government come September. We will govern for all  Australians. Every part of Australia matters. Every Australian counts. The last thing that you’ll ever see  from me and from Coalition frontbenchers is dividing Australian from Australian on the basis of class,  gender or whether you were born here or not. That is alien to our way. We want to bring Australians  together and that’s what you’ll get from an incoming Coalition government.     

 I’m going to ask Jason as the candidate and the former local member just to say a few words. I’m going to  ask Sophie as a working mum to say a few words and then obviously I’ll take a few questions.

 JASON WOOD:    

 Thank you very much, Tony and welcome everybody. It’s so great to have Tony here and we thank him very  much for taking the time out of his exceptionally busy schedule to be here today in Beaconsfield.     

 For those who don’t know, La Trobe actually covers right up to the Dandenong ranges where each summer  the great concern and threat is bushfires and Tony, you would understand residents’ concerns only too well  with your background in the CFA. This is the south of the electorate and the great concern here is basically  the cost of living and residents are telling me they’re angry because of the Labor Gillard Government’s  mismanagement and wasteful spending of their hard-earned taxes. So much so, local hospital services have  been reduced. Today we actually got to meet Rosie Hopgood and some of her friends to discuss their  concerns regarding the cost of living. But again, Tony, welcome to La Trobe. It’s always a pleasure to have  you here. Thank you.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Soph?    

 SOPHIE MIRABELLA:    

 As a working mum, as a federal member of Parliament who meets with families every day I’ve got one  message for the Labor Party, people are doing it tough, the cost of living has gone up, people are hurting and  are making sacrifices and when you tell them they’ve never had it so good they get angry, because you  haven’t made the time to understand how real people are suffering out there in the community because their  costs have gone up and up and up. Their anxiety about job security is very real and families are saving more  than ever in an attempt to make sure that if a bad day does come, they’ve got some savings there if they can  and the best thing we can do for families to give them the hope for a better future for their children, for the  opportunity to give their families the choices that they want to give them is to take the high cost off  electricity by getting rid of the carbon tax, giving them a bit of an easy go so that they can get on with their  lives.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mrs Mirabella, you mentioned that phrase when talking to the women inside, that the government had been  saying that they’ve never had it so good. Who exactly has said that recently?    

 SOPHIE MIRABELLA:    

 Well we’ve seen whether they’re commenting in the media, whether it’s Mark Latham, former Labor leader  now spruiking for the Labor Party, whether it’s Labor ministers talking about how well the economy is  going. They don’t understand what is happening on the ground and policy…    

 QUESTION:    

 But nobody’s used that exact phrasing, have they?    

 SOPHIE MIRBELLA:    

 Well, I’m not going to quibble about words. The reality is the Labor Party is saying the economy’s never  been so good. Well, politicians govern for real people. We are here to create a better Australia and better  opportunities for all Australians and when Australians in suburbs like Beaconsfield are suffering, when their  life is worse than before the carbon tax, that’s sending a very strong message to the Government: get rid of  the carbon tax and stop introducing policies that are slugging families.

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Ok, do we have any questions?    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, you say part of taking the pressure off families will be axing the carbon tax. If you manage to do  that, will electricity prices actually fall?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, if you believe the government, ten per cent of the price of power is the carbon tax. So if you get rid of  the carbon tax, that’s ten per cent of the price of power gone and we will charge the ACCC with the job of  policing the removal of this tax and its consequent impact on prices.    

 QUESTION:    

 But given that power prices have been going up by more than ten per cent for a number of years, could it be  the case that prices don’t rise as much as they would, that they won’t actually fall?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, there’s no doubt that prices have been going up and up and up under the current government. Power  prices around Australia have gone up by 90 per cent - 90 per cent since December 2007 - and this  government’s policies have contributed substantially to that price rise particularly and immediately through  the carbon tax. Now, we’re going to take the carbon tax off. According to the Government, that’s 10 per cent  that will go from the price of your power.    

 QUESTION:    

 And you say you’ll keep much of the compensation; that people will be able to keep much of the  compensation, how much is much? Is it 70 per cent, or 80 per cent?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well Lyndal, they will know in good time before the next election exactly what the consequences of our  policies will be but the assurance that I give is that families will be better off. Families will be better off  because the carbon tax will be gone and the carbon tax is driving up your power price, it’s damaging the  economy, it’s not helping the environment. The mining tax will be gone because that’s damaging investment  and jobs. The budget will be back in the black because that means that we can afford the things that we need  to spend money on and of course the boats will be stopped because what has been done before can be done  again.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, you’d be aware that a former federal court judge is reviewing the cases of 56 people who arrived  on boats who had adverse security assessments from ASIO. Will you continue with that process if you win  the next election?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I think it’s very important to try to ensure that our country is safe and ensuring that the people who  come to this country aren’t security risks is an important part of that.

 QUESTION:    

 Will you be keeping what the Government said was tripling the tax-free threshold and also keeping the tax  cut that low income earners got on their superannuation given you mentioned inside the house the  importance of superannuation?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 All to be announced in good time before the next election. But just on the subject of super, we’ve had a lot  of hyperventilating from the government on that subject. Let’s be crystal clear. This government has taken  more than $3 billion out of low income earners’ super by reducing the Howard Government’s co-contribution for low income earners from $1,500 to $500.     

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, in regards to the 457 visa, you said that the Prime Minister was demonising foreigners. Will you  make it easier for foreign workers to work here in Australia?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think we’ve got a perfectly good system for bringing people in, who can make a contribution from day one  - from day one. People who are coming here on 457 visas are joining the team and they’re making a  contribution from day one and this is a great part of the Australian story, having people come to this country  and making a contribution from day one. Now, the difference is, between myself and the Prime Minister, the  Government is tolerating people coming to this country and going on welfare and they’re demonising people  coming to this country and working from day one. That’s the difference.    

 QUESTION:    

 Are you profiting from fear on this issue, as the Prime Minister’s accused you of this morning?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well it’s interesting, I was in western Sydney on Sunday and I was with a crowd of people - nearly all of  whom had come to this country - and the point that they made was that people should come the right way,  not the wrong way. Now, people coming on 457 visas are coming the right way, not the wrong way. They’re  making a contribution from day one. They’re not going on welfare.    

 QUESTION:    

 Would you then roll back the restrictions the Government’s put on 457 visas?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think there’s been a lot of huffing and puffing from this government and so often they talk a lot but they  don’t do very much. The fact is no one can come to this country on a 457 visa unless the relevant employer  has made a big effort to find an Australian to fill the job and unless that person is coming in on above  average weekly earnings. So, it costs the employer far more to employ someone on a 457 than it does to  employ an Australian to do the job. So, again, I say why is the Prime Minister trying to divide Australians?  Why is she trying to divide Australians yet again? First of all we had the false class war, then we had the  false gender war, now we’ve got the false birthplace law. It’s typical of a Prime Minister who is all about  dividing our country instead of governing in the national interest.    

 QUESTION: 

 5 

 

 

 Was that a yes that the restrictions would be, you would roll back the restrictions the Government’s put on? 

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think the system that applied under the Howard Government is a perfectly good system. We’ve had a lot of  huffing and puffing from government ministers. I saw the Prime Minister on television this morning. She  was asked to identify some of these so-called rorts that she talks about. She wasn’t able to produce a single  example.    

 QUESTION:    

 Were you getting a little bit ahead of yourself yesterday in declaring western Sydney a Liberal heartland?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 If you look at the results of the state election, Michael, obviously it is a Liberal heartland. Now, I want to try  to ensure that it’s a Liberal heartland in every sense, not just in the state government sense. What the modern  Liberal Party is trying to do is to govern for all Australians. It doesn’t matter where you live, where you’ve  come from, what you do. It doesn’t matter what your race, your gender is. We want you to be part of the  great Australian family. We want you to be part of the extended family of the Australian nation and I think  that the Liberal Party can speak to all Australians because no one group owns us, no one group exclusively  funds us. I don’t have to go to union conferences and beg for my job the way the Prime Minister does. I  don’t have to make promise after promise after promise which is carefully tailored and targeted to a union  audience because in the end, it’s the party room, not the faceless men, who determine who runs the Liberal  Party. That’s one of the big differences between the Coalition and the ALP right now.    

 QUESTION:    

 A quick question on the WestConnex road in Sydney. The money you would give to New South Wales for  that road if you were in government, you told an interview in January that it would be contingent on  including a link to the CBD. Is that still your position?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We’re going to get it done. We are going to get it done and we are going to work with the state government  to get it done. Now…    

 QUESTION:    

 That includes a link to the CBD?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 ...what the Prime Minister was doing yesterday was not committing to get it built, she was committing to  have a fight. She was setting up yet another stage-managed, carefully -choreographed, world championship  wrestling-style fight with the state government. Now, I think we have got to move beyond all of that. The  important thing, the thing that the public wants, is to see positive change for the better. They want to see  cranes over our cities, they want to see bulldozers on the ground, they want to see the traffic jams ended and  that is what will happen under a Coalition government.    

 QUESTION:    

 And do they want to see a link between WestConnex and the CBD? 

 6 

 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, obviously we want to see the best possible infrastructure but we want to see something happen soon  and we are going to work with the state government to get it done. Now, the interesting point that is worth  making is that the Prime Minister says she has seen no plans. Well, you know, the Secretary of the Federal  Transport Department is on the steering committee for WestConnex. She should actually pick up the phone  and talk to Mike Mrdak and she’d know all about WestConnex. So, yet again, what we see from the  government is a pose, not a policy; it’s an announcement not a programme; and, really, I think the people of  western Sydney, the people of Australia can see right through what is yet another Prime Ministerial stunt.  Basically this is another broken promise in the making that is what it is, another broken promise in the  making. A commitment of $1 billion that she knows is never going to be delivered.    

 QUESTION:    

 Can you explain how Mr Morrison’s proposal to inform residence if people with bridging visas move into  their neighbourhoods will work in practice and were you briefed on it before he announced it?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the point I want to make is that the federal government needs to know where people are because these  are people whose immigration status is unclear…    

 QUESTION:    

 Do residents need to know where people are?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the point that I am making is that the federal government needs to know where people are because  their immigration status is unclear. Now, if they turn out to be accorded refugee status, the Government  needs to make contact with them to say yes you can begin a new life at least for a period of time in this  country. If they are not, the Government needs to know where they are because they may well have to be  taken into custody again and returned to their country. So, this is about a government which has not only lost  control of its borders but it has lost control of boat people once they come to this country.    

 QUESTION:    

 If you are applying that to people who hold bridging visas, why not apply the same standard to people who  would hold temporary protection visas under a Coalition government because by their very nature aren’t  they just temporary?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, a bridging visa is a very short-term thing. A temporary protection visa is something that lasts for a  particular term. So, I just think there is an absolutely, clear distinction between them.     

 Alright local issues.    

 QUESTION:    

 Casey and Dandenong Hospital with the surgery time and waiting times having gone up. Would you  reinstate that funding that the states says has been lost under the national partnership agreement?    

 7 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the problem is that the $107 million which the Commonwealth Government has ripped out of the  Victorian hospitals, it has been ripped out in the middle of a financial year and the financial year will be  over before there is a change of government if there is an election held on September 14 and if the Coalition  wins. So, unfortunately, the damage will be done. Now, I want to work closely with the Baillieu  Government. The Baillieu Government has in fact put more money into hospitals. I think it is something in  the order of $700 million that the Baillieu Government has been putting into hospitals. Sure, they’ve been  looking for efficiencies, but all the savings from those efficiencies have been reinvested into health.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, a member of the state's planning minister advisory committee has put forward this scheme to  give away free blocks of lands for up to ten years to encourage people to buy rather than rent. Is that  something you support?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I obviously support home ownership. Home ownership is part of the great Australian dream but that is  essentially a state government matter. I am confident that the Baillieu Government will handle it well and I  will leave it in their hands.    

 QUESTION:    

 Are you aware of the issues surrounding the Victorian government today, particularly Ted Baillieu. Does he  have your support? I understand Liberal MPs are in a crisis meeting this morning.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, as far as I am aware it is just another meeting but the fact is that I know Ted Baillieu, I like Ted  Baillieu, I work with Ted Baillieu. I believe he is a man of great integrity, a man of honour and the instant  he was aware of these issues he referred them off to the independent watchdog.    

 Thank you
