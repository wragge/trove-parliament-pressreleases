 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/848 FRIDAY 3 SEPTEMBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  Refugees in SA can Lose Benefits with New Gov't Measure The Australian Democrats have criticised both a recent Government move which could mean some refugees lose access to some Centrelink payments for up to two years and Mr Ruddock's comments drawing a link between the hostage siege in Russia and Australian calls for an intelligence agency inquiry. "It is grossly inappropriate and misleading to use the tragic situation in Russia to attack political opponents in an election campaign, particularly from a government that has made Australia less safe because of their poor judgement on defence and security. "Philip Ruddock is the last person who should be making such claims. Leader of the Australian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett, who will tonight attend a gathering of Afghani refugees in Murray Bridge in South Australia, says the Government's much-touted new measures to 'benefit' refugees in Australia on temporary visas could lead to many losing access to income support payments from Centrelink and in some cases to Medicare as well. "It is absolutely outrageous that refugees who have already spent over three years in Australia are potentially subject to the 2 year waiting period for income support payments and other assistance such as health care cards if they succeed in gaining other visas," Senator Bartlett said. "The two year waiting period is meant to be for newly arrived migrants taking up permanent visas for the first time and is not meant to apply to refugees. "In addition, refugees who successfully apply for a different temporary visa, such as a student visa, may also lose access to Medicare! "About 70 Afghani refugees live in Murray Bridge. All have been separated from their families for between 3 -5 years. "At least 15 of these men suffer from a range of psychological conditions as a direct result of the Howard Government's inhumane and unnecessary immigration policies. "The Government's new measures are asking refugees to discard their refugee status and cloak themselves as economic migrants.  It is a further demonstration of this Governmentâ€™s deceptive attempts to create a distinction between 'deserving' and 'undeserving' refugees. "The Australian Democrats have called on the Labor Party to commit to abolishing temporary refugee visas, mandatory detention and other inhumane immigration policies if elected."
