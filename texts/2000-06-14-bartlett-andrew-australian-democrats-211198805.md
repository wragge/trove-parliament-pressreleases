 RUDDOCK HEADS WRONG-WAY Detention centre taskforce - More to be spent to make problem worse The Australian Democrats have labelled Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock’s review of immigration detention centres a cover-up for the Government’s failed mandatory detention policy.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett said it was time Minister Ruddock stopped blaming everyone else and accepted that the Government’s practice of compulsorily locking-up every asylum seeker is unnecessary, inhumane, expensive and extremely socially divisive.

 “To justify the policy of mandatory detention - which few western or European countries do - the Minister has vilified these people, falsely portraying them all as criminals who bring the threat of disease and as a burden on taxpayers,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Mandatory detention of all asylum seekers costs taxpayers millions of dollars a week. Overseas experience shows that this highly expensive and inhumane approach is not necessary to protect public safety and health.

 “Minister Ruddock has made no secret of his aim to make life as difficult as possible for those refugees who are finally released into the Australian community. It is reasonable to assume he is also keen to make things uncomfortable for those who are still in the detention centres,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Unnecessary compulsory detention for long periods of time and widespread use of incommunicado detention are obviously going to produce unrest.

 “The Minister’s review will almost certainly recommend spending more public money on security, which will only make the problem of appalling conditions worse,” he said.

 “Any review of detention centre security which focuses on fences, guards

 and razor wire without looking at the fundamentally flawed policy of mandatory detention will just be a further waste of taxpayers’ money.

 “Any extra funds should be directed not at security measures but at extra staff to speed up the processing times, saving money in the long-term by reducing detention times.

 “The sooner people are processed, the sooner they can be either removed from Australia or, if they are genuine refugees, allowed into the Australian community to contribute to our society as so many refugees have in the past.

 “Once again we have this Federal Government not only fuelling the flames of social division for its own short-term political gain, but spending millions of taxpayers’ dollars to do so. It is the Minister’s approach that is putting the security and health of the Australian community at risk, not asylum seekers or those trying to assist them,” he said.

 There will always be a small number of people who will need to be detained for some time to verify security or health issues, but there is no reason this should apply to all asylum seekers.
