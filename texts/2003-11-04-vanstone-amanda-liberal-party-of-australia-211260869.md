 Labor Must Decide On Illegal Immigrants

 VPS 003/2003

 An Indonesian fishing boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants has been discovered near Melville Island just off the coast from Darwin.

 While the details of the unauthorised arrivals are being determined, Labor should be explaining to the Australian public what their position is on  illegal immigrants.

 In June 2002, Labor voted down some Regulations that excluded Melville Island from the Migration zone.

 This afternoon, the Government had those Regulation gazetted again. The Regulations are effective as of 12-midnight today.

 Labor must now decide whether they will again make Australia an easy target for people smugglers by including islands like Melville in our  Migration zone. These islands are just a stone's throw from Indonesia and a convenient dropping off centre for people smugglers to land their  cargo.

 The arrival of this boat should clearly demonstrate to the Senate that these Regulations are needed.

 Australia has a generous and robust immigration system that helps those people in real need but processes need to be in place. Every time an  asylum seekers pays a people smuggler tens of thousands of dollars to successfully jump the queue, a refuge who has been waiting in appalling  conditions in an African camp misses out. 

 Why should someone with cash to pay a people smuggler be allowed to take the place of someone who has no money and is in even more of a  desperate situation?

 Labor must tell the Australian public whether they will again vote down the Regulations that are protecting our borders from the easy exploitation  of people smugglers.
