       - MEDIA RELEASE -   SENATOR ERIC ABETZ  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  Shadow Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations 

 Liberal Senator for Tasmania 

 

 5th April 2011   

 Pontville Detention Centre - Tasmania   

 “Labor’s plan to transport 400 asylum seekers to Tasmania is absolute proof that this  Government has lost control of its border protection policy,” Senator Abetz said  today.   

 “Immigration Minister Chris Bowen is kidding when he says the detention centre to  be built at Pontville is temporary. Work at the new centre at Wickham in Darwin  hasn’t even started.”   

 “We all know that this Government’s idea of ‘short term’ is ‘long term’ and this is  further proof of Labor deceiving the Australian people with ill-conceived, hastily  implemented, knee jerk policy,” Senator Abetz said.   

 “Before the election Prime Minister Gillard trumpeted that she had done a deal to  house asylum seekers in East Timor.”   

 “Today’s announcement is absolute proof that Labor’s East Timor solution is now  dead in the water.”   

 “Labor is building more detention beds than hospital beds and Darwin’s departure  lounge has now become Hobart’s arrivals hall,” Senator Abetz said.
