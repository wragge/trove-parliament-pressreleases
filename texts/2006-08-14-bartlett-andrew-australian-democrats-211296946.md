 Democrats Welcome Refugee Win

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed the withdrawal of asylum seeker legislation due to the  inability of the Government to get enough support from Senate Coalition colleagues and Independents to  ensure the passage of the Bill.    

 "This is a huge win for human rights and credit is due to all the refugee supporters and advocates who  have tirelessly lobbied Members of Parliament," Senator Bartlett said.   

 "Finally, there seems to have been a realisation amongst some Coalition members of just how draconian  and cruel the Government's approach to asylum seekers has been."   

 "It is a great shame that it has taken so long for Senators to have a change of heart on this matter. The  findings of the recent Senate Committee should have been motivation enough."   

 "And far from "adding strength to already strong 'border protection' laws" as the Prime Minster claimed  today, the proposed changes did absolutely nothing to enhance 'border protection', they only laid down a  false sense of security in the Australian community and rode roughshod over the rights of asylum  seekers."    

 "Terrorists don't arrive by boats."   

 "The Government chose to have the Bill pulled rather than face the scrutiny of the Senate and the ire of  its colleagues and for this win we must be grateful," Senator Bartlett said.
