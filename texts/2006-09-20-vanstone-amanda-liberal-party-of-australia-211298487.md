 Australia Welcomes 215 Refugees This Week 

 20 September 2006 

 Australia will again this week welcome 215 refugee and humanitarian entrants, who are  among those most in need of resettlement, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs, Amanda Vanstone said today. 

 “Of these arrivals 141 are refugees, many of whom have been waiting in refugee camps for  years,” Senator Vanstone said. 

 Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of  resettlement. 

 The remaining 74 people are Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They have been  forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They  also have family or other links with Australia.  

 More than 100 arrivals are from Africa, 75 from the Middle East and South West Asia, and  11 arrivals are from South East Asia.  

 These are all entrants under Australia's refugee and humanitarian programme which  provides 13 000 places each year.  

 “Australia is able to offer protection to so many people, in part, because of our commitment  to maintaining tough border security,” Senator Vanstone said. 

 “There are 13 family groups amongst the arrivals (a total of 61 people), who have been  granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk. These are women who have  lost male family members and are therefore particularly vulnerable.” 

 These refugee and humanitarian entrants will settle across Australia as follows:
