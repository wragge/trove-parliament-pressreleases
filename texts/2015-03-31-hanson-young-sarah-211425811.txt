 The Australian Greens   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 31 March 2015    

 Incompetent Government can’t be trusted with sensitive personal information   

 The Australian Greens have today said that Department of Immigration has a lot to answer for following  the ‘accidental’ release of several world leaders’ personal details.    

 "The level of incompetency of this government is startling, first the leak and then to have not even  notified those implicated is bad form. You've got to wonder if the Abbott Government could be trusted  to organise a bun fight in a bakery, Greens’ spokesperson for immigration, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said."    

 “It was only last week the Government was calling on the Australian people to trust them with their  data, and now we find out they have disclosed the details of our world leaders.   

  “This just proves that this Government cannot be trusted to manage people’s personal information  properly.   

 “This is not the first time the Department of Immigration and Border Protection have improperly  disclosed confidential information.    

 “Last year some 10,000 asylum seekers personal details were inadvertently released by the Department,  this ineptitude has put thousands of people at further risk.    

 “Australian Border Force now has the power to access everyday Australians personal details. How they  are to be trusted with this information following these incidents is beyond me.    

 “This is another serious gaffe by an incompetent Government.”
