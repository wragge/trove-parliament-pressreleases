 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Abbott's tough talk fails the truth test  Tuesday, 7 July 2010 

 Tony Abbott's tough talk on asylum seekers has repeatedly failed the truth test,  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today. 

 ‘It's time to put Mr Abbott's talk to the test. He is asking Australians to trust him on  border protection when, time and time again, he fails to tell the Australian people the  truth,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘It's time for him to explain how his talk will ever translate into anything meaningful. 

 ‘Mr Abbott can't explain how he will turn the boats back in international waters  without endangering the lives of Australian border protection and defence officers. 

 ‘He can't explain how he will stop people smugglers attempting to disable their boats  on the open ocean.  

 ‘He can't explain how he will tow the boats back to where they came from when  countries in the region would not welcome this approach. 

 ‘He can't explain this policy because it is a nonsense and it's just not true. 

 ‘It's little more than a simplistic, shallow slogan and it is far from a workable solution.  Will Tony Abbott really leave children to drown when their vessels are sabotaged by  people smugglers?’ 

 Senator Evans said the inconvenient truth for Mr Abbott is that during the entire time  of the Howard government, only seven boats were turned back and John Howard  stopped the practice in 2003 because it put the lives of Australians at risk. 

 The Opposition's policy announcements today also fail the truth test. 

 Mr Abbott has claimed he will determine if someone has deliberately dumped their  identity and travel documents. But he can't explain how this will be done,’ Senator  Evans said. 

 ‘Since World War II, there have been asylum seekers who have been unable to  obtain identity documents for a range of reasons. Will Mr Abbott really send these 

 people back to face persecution and possible death because they can't produce a  piece of paper? 

 ‘What Mr Abbott didn't tell you was that exactly the same proposal was raised and  rejected in 2003 by the Howard government. It is beyond the scope of the Migration  Act and would most likely contravene the Refugee Convention.  

 ‘The Howard government recognised that this was bad, unworkable policy then and  nothing has changed.’ 

 Senator Evans said it was also impractical to suggest the Minister intervene in all  individual assessments. 

 ‘Under existing legislation, introduced by the Coalition and retained by Labor, the  Coalition appears to be suggesting that the Minister should be revisiting the merits of  every positive refugee decision,’ he said. 

 ‘There is already scope to refuse to allow an asylum seeker to apply for a visa if it is  in the public interest. 

 ‘Under the Howard government, there were nearly 10 000 irregular maritime arrivals  granted a visa to Australia between 1999 and 2001. 

 ‘It is ridiculous to suggest that former Minister Philip Ruddock should have been  looking at each of these cases individually.’ 

 Senator Evans said in 2000-2001, the approval rate for Afghan asylum seekers was  above 97 per cent. In the same year, the approval rate for Iraqi asylum seekers was  nearly 96 per cent. 

 ‘Labor has improved the rigour, integrity and independence of the assessment  regime,’ he said. 

 Senator Evans said the Opposition had also failed to provide detail on the proposal  to allow community groups to sponsor refugees which appeared to be little more  than an attempt to put a soft edge on the Opposition's policies. Despite Mr Abbott's  rhetoric, there would no new places available under the humanitarian program. 

 ‘Mr Abbott would like Australians to believe that these are all simple matters that he  can fix with tough talk,’ the Minister said.  

 ‘The truth is you can't always believe Mr Abbott. These are complex issues and  when you scratch below the surface of his tough talk you find Mr Abbott's policies  simply don't stack up.’
