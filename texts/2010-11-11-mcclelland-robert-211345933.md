 INTERVIEW WITH CELINA EDMONDS - SKY NEWS LUNCHTIME  AGENDA   

 THURSDAY, 11 NOVEMBER 2010   

 Subject: High Court rulings   

 

 CELINA EDMONDS:  Hello and welcome to Lunchtime Agenda on this Remembrance Day, I’m  Celina Edmonds. The High Court has this morning handed down two significant judgements.    

 Firstly, in a ruling which could have major implications for offshore processing of asylum seekers,  the Court found that two Tamil men were denied legal fairness when seeking a review of their  refugee claims; and in a separate matter, the court has found South Australia’s anti-bikie laws  unconstitutional. The decision could impact on similar laws in other states around the country.  I  spoke to Attorney-General Robert McClelland about the verdict just a short time ago.   

 Thank you for your time Attorney-General. Can you tell me what’s your understanding of this  ruling in the case of these two asylum seekers? The High Court says the Government erred and that  these men were denied procedural fairness.   

 ROBERT McCLELLAND:   I haven’t read the decision. Chris Bowen, the Minister for  Immigration, will be making some comments shortly on the case. I understand the decision is not to  overturn the offshore processing regime, but rather to indicate that a level of additional review is  appropriate in respect to legal matters relating to the decision making process including potentially  those relating to the issue of procedural fairness, but I haven’t read the decision- that’s my broad  understanding of the thrust of the decision.   

 EDMONDS:  Yes, the report’s coming out and as we both know this is only just really been  announced this morning that it was an error of law for the offshore processing regime to deny  asylum seekers their rights to apply for a protection visa.   

 McCLELLAND:  The finding that there has been a flawed process in terms of procedural fairness  can give rise to an error of law. I suspect that this has been the focus of the decision. I understand  that there has been an indication that there are additional review or appeal rights in respect to those  aspects of the decision that relate to errors of law. I think that’s essentially the thrust of the  outcome.   

 EDMONDS:  But it would suggest that there may need to be a major rethink, a major change in  approach?   

 McCLELLAND:  Without reading the decision, it’s just not possible to know whether there can be  refinement of process to avoid those procedural fairness challenges. I’m not sure, I would need to  read the decision, but Chris Bowen will be going into that shortly. 

 Attorney General News Release 2 

 

 EDMONDS:  Attorney-General, on another issue, the High Court has also said the South Australian  laws aimed at cracking down on motorcycle gangs have been declared invalid. What’s your  response to that news?   

 McCLELLAND:  We’re aware of the decision and aware of the arguments of the case. The first  thing I would say is that the Federal Organised Crime Legislation takes a different approach to that  which was taken in South Australia.  The issue of whether an organised crime gang, including a  bikie gang, is one involved in organised crime under federal legislation is for the determination of  the courts.     

 So we’ve taken a different approach to that to which was taken in South Australia where effectively  the Attorney-General made that determination effectively as a member of the Executive, as opposed  to judicial determination and again I understand that as being the gravamen found by the High  Court.   

 EDMONDS:  And, does this make your push, ‘cause I understand you’ve been calling for  nationally consistent laws to tackle bikie gangs if that’s what’s needed. Is this decision going to  make that task any easier or harder to achieve?   

 McCLELLAND:  Certainly we want nationally consistent laws both in terms of apprehending and  taking criminal action against those involved in organised crime, but also in respect to confiscation  of assets, undisclosed wealth provisions and the like.    

 So I expect that the new South Australian Attorney-General, John Rau, will act quickly to rectify  the legislation and to take measures to ensure that there is a regime applicable in South Australia,  but you’re quite right. It is important that all states have these laws in place so that there is no safe  haven around Australia.   

 EDMONDS: Today you were also releasing a draft bill for public consultation about amendments  to the Family Law Act, I understand?   

 McCLELLAND:  Yes, that’s right. It’s for public discussion. Essentially there are three measures.  The first is to expand the definition of violence and abuse so it includes psychological intimidation.  The second is to remove disincentives that have been found and reported to the government for  people to report concerns about family violence and child abuse. And the third is to place on legal  practitioners an obligation to disclose concerns about violence to the courts and a corresponding  obligation on the courts to make proper inquiry into that.   

 EDMONDS:  It’s always an area that creates a lot of public discussion, isn’t it?   

 McCLELLAND:  It’s going to be one where there will be vocal and strong advocacy by men’s  groups and by women’s groups, but I repeatedly say the Government’s concerns is what’s in the  best interests of children and indeed there’s issues for the community because all the indications are  that a dysfunctional family life can cause ongoing social problems and the rest of the community is  affected by that so there are broader arguments to consider, but our focus is on the best interest of  children.   

 

 EDMONDS:  How long do people have to comment?   

 McCLELLAND:  Until the Fourteenth of January.   

 Attorney General News Release 3 

 EDMONDS:  Just finally, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott made some comments last night at a  community forum regarding the election of judges as almost inevitable if the courts continue to give  light sentences- now that was what was quoted in the newspapers today. That wouldn’t be very easy  to achieve in Australia though would it?   

 McCLELLAND:  No it would be contrary to the system of British justice that we’ve inherited. It’s  at least eight-hundred years old, going back to the Magna Carta. The danger of that reasoning is that  if you have judges who are accountable to the body-politic for their appointment and reappointment  you’re going to see political motivated decisions. It’s never been part of our justice system, never  been part of our culture. And it will never happen to be frank, and I think that suggestions that we  will see judges elected in Australia is, with due respect to the Opposition Leader, fanciful.   

 EDMONDS:  Attorney-General, I do thank you very much for your time.   

 McCLELLAND:  Thank you.
