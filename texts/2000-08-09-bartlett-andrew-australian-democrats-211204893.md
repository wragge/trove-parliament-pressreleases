 Ruddock's refugee bashing continues as humanitarian crisis looms Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has continued his attacks on refugees in Australia in the face of a clear message from all state governments that a humanitarian crisis is looming in cities around the nation.

 Australian Democrats' immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, says Minister Ruddock is complaining about refugees 'double dipping' from welfare services. At the same time, all State and Territory Community Services Ministers have released a joint statement expressing major concerns at the hugely increased burden on community and state government welfare agencies by the numbers of destitute refugees.

 "The Federal Coalition has made no secret of the fact that they want these refugees to suffer and has done whatever it can to make it hard for these people to be able to access housing, health, education and welfare assistance. For the Minister to then vilify them by suggesting they are somehow rorting the system by seeking help is simply a disgrace.

 "The Federal Government has abandoned its responsibilities to assist members of our community who are in need. It is apparently willing to encourage major social problems to develop in our cities by leaving thousands of people in dire need without access to adequate support," said Senator Bartlett.

 "The Democrats congratulate the state governments for not joining the Federal Government in abandoning their responsibilities to members of their community.

 "The Federal Government has left the state governments to carry the can for trying to prevent a humanitarian crisis developing in cities around the country.

 "The Coalition's policy of temporary protection and refusing assistance for refugees must go down as one of the most divisive and destructive government actions in our nation's history.

 "There is no clearer example of this Federal Government's willingness to foster division in our community in an attempt to gain political advantage.

 "For what must be the first time ever, we have a Federal Government trying to prevent charities from providing assistance to people who are in desperate need. You can't go much lower than that," Senator Bartlett concluded.
