 Support Grows for Family Visitor Network

 MPS 103/2002

 Almost 1,100 people a month are using a new network that helps Australians better understand the process for family members to visit from overseas, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

 The Family Visitor Network, launched locally in Hobart today, is an Australia-wide information network aimed at raising community awareness about the Government's visitor visa policy, procedures and decision-making processes at overseas posts.

 Since the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) established an information line for the Family Visitor Network, there has been an average of 1,082 enquiries per month.

 In October 2002, the information line received the highest number of calls at 1,391. This represents a 97 per cent increase on calls received in July. In addition, Family Visitor Network officers across Australia have directly received an average of 151 calls per month from community leaders or MPs.

 There have been encouraging signs for tourism, with visitor numbers from emerging markets increasing despite the worldwide decline in international travel since 11 September 2001.

 In the past 12 months, tourist numbers from China had increased 17.6 per cent, 13 per cent from Israel, 12.9 per cent from the Republic of Korea and 10.7 per cent from Vietnam.

 "The increase in those numbers has been linked to an encouraging improvement in the compliance with our immigration laws and the growth in bona fide visitors," Mr Ruddock said.

 "As a result, the overall approval rate for visitor visas had increased to 97.94 per cent.

 "The non-return rate has dropped below two per cent for the first time, which indicates that the initiatives implemented by my Department are working," Mr Ruddock said.

 The number of people arriving in Australia and then applying for refugee status has dropped to 0.15 per cent.

 *An information kit to facilitate visitor visa applications is available by ringing DIMIA on 131 881 and following the prompts to speak to a family visitor telephone operator.
