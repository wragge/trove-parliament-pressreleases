  MEDIA RELEASE

  

  DUNCAN KERR MP

  SHADOW MINISTER FOR JUSTICE & CUSTOM

  

 18 November 1999

  

  Ruddock’s unaccompanied luggage lands at 
Christmas Island

  

  “Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has barely unpacked from his 
return trip to China, which he hailed as  a screaming success 
in plugging the hole and stop the stream of boat people arriving front 
China, to be greeted by a boat carrying 60 Chinese illegals at Christmas 
Island,” Shadow Justice and Customs Minister, Duncan Kerr, said today.

  

 But this is no laughing matter. No amount of denial 
or rhetoric from Ministers Ruddock and Vanstone will convince the community 
that our coastal security is being managed adequately.

  

 “The Opposition again renews its call on the Government 
to bite the bullet on coastal surveillance and examine establishing 
a single integrated, well resourced and effective coastguard to take 
charge of maritime security and law enforcement.

  

 “The message of Australia being a soft target must 
play a role in the recent influx of large numbers of illegals from China 
and the Middle-East. An effective coastguard better able to detect and 
apprehend boats early will help turn this message around,” Mr Kerr 
said.
