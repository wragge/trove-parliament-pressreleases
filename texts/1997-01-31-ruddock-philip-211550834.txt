  Invitation for applications for Community Grants Program 

  Priority for refugee and humanitarian entrants and a greater emphasis on accountability  and service delivery will be the features of the 1997-98 Community Grants Program the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today. 

  Mr Ruddock, has invrted community organisations to apply for the grants administered by  the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). 

  ''The aim of the grants is to help organisations provide specific services for newly arrived  migrants and refugees, and other groups with settlement needs", Mr Ruddock said. 

  The grants will be advertised in tomorrow's press with applications to be made by Friday  14 March . The Community Grants program consists of two schemes : 

   " the Grant-in-Aid scheme under which grants are awarded for up to three  years to help organisations employ a specialist social welfare worker; and   " the Migrant Access Projects Scheme , which provides grants to help  organisations undertake service delivery projects, complex research projects 

  and purchase equipment. 

  The Minister said the submissions most likely to be successful were those which focused  on projects or services to improve the settlement prospects of: 

   " recently-arrived migrants and humanitarian entrants with demonstrated  settlement needs   " groups identified as having high priority needs by StaterTerritory Offices of  DIMA. 

  "The Government is committed to providing services which help migrants and refugees  settle in their new country and qu ickly become contributing members of our community .  The terminating grants to community organisations assist in this process." 

  "I would also encourage joint submissions from commun ity-based agenc ies and  organisations which address priority needs and foster broader commun ity interaction ." 

  "Grants may target settlement priorities within a particular community or offer a specialist  service across several groups." 

  "The Gov em merrt will ensure that a high level of accountability IS app lied to organisations  receiving grants to ensure that mC<3surC'lble outcomes are C'lchieved ."
