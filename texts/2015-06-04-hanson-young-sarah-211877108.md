 MEDIA RELEASE    

 

 Thursday 4 June 2015    

 

 AUSTRALIA PAYS MILLIONS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO ITS DIRTY WORK    

 The cloak and dagger secrecy of the Australian Government continues after the arrival  of four refugees in Cambodia from Nauru.      

 “Australia has bribed Cambodia to take these poor people. There is no assurance any of  this money will go to those who need it,” Greens spokesperson on Immigration Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It is clear that the Australian-Cambodian deal is an expensive flop. Only four people  have agreed to go at a huge cost of $55.5 million Australian dollars   

 “Refugees in Nauru should be resettled in Australia. It is shameful that Australia has  taken advantage of a poor country like Cambodia. Paying them to do the things Australia  doesn’t want to   

 “The government is blatantly paying off these nations to do Australia’s dirty work on  asylum seeker detention
