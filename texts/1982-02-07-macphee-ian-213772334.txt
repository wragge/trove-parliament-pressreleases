 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs.  Hon Ian Macphee, MP

 \0 MEASURES TO EXPEDITE POLISH MIGRANT AND REFUGEE PROCESSING

 "After consultation with the Government of Austria and the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and leaders -   of the Australian Polish community, the Government has  decided to increase further its intake of both Polish refugees 

 and migrants", the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ian Macphee, said today.

 "Last year Australia.resettled more Eastern European refugees  than any other country. In December the Government's global  allocation for Refugees and Special Humanitarian Programs was  lifted by 1 000 to 23 500 to allow for an increased intake  of Polish refugees. This allocation has now been further 

 increased by an additional 1 000 places to 24 500 for the  same purpose."

 "In addition, a special quota of 1 000 places for Polish  migrants (as distinct from the 1 000 refugees) has been  establishe~d"to expedite the clearance of the large volume  of applicationsâ¢lodged at Vienna and Cologne prior to December_â 

 13 1981 when martial law was imposed in Poland." .......  .  .

 "After careful consideration the Government does not believe  that it is in the interests of Poles outside Poland to be  encouraged prematurely to apply for resettlement. This view  is consistent with the approach taken by other Western 

 Governments and/UNHCR." '

 "A great majority of Poles presently outside Poland have not  applied for resettlement as they are in countries which are  prepared to have-them stay until they have decided whether to  return to Poland or seek resettlement elsewhere."

 "The decision to seek resettlement is a serious step. Many  Poles are now adopting a 'wait-and-see1  attitude in the hope  that they can return home eventually. The Government in concert  with others has therefore avoided action which might induce 

 these persons in Europe to apply to be resettled elsewhere."

 "Australia will interview all applicants and discuss with them  the option which best suits them. The latest increase gives  Australia a greater capacity to respond to foreseeable pressures.  The situation in Poland and the circumstances of Poles presently 

 outside Poland will be kept under continuing review." .  .

 Further decisions would.again be made in consultation with other resettlement countries', international agencies and members of ·' -  the Australian Polish community."
