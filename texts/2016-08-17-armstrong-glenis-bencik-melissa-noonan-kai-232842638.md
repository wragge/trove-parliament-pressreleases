 EMBARGO - 12:01AM 17TH AUGUST 2016 

 THIS IS CRITICAL: An unprecedented 103 current and former workers speak out   

 An unprecedented one hundred and three former staff previously and currently employed in offshore  processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru have today issued a statement warning that the only way to  secure the safety of refugees and asylum seekers in these locations is to bring them to Australia immediately.    

 Those who support this view include doctors, teachers, case workers, managers and social workers from  Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield), Save the Children, IHMS, Salvation Army and other contracted workers  with first-hand experience across both Manus Island and Nauru Regional Processing Centres.   

 They strongly believe that the establishment of another Senate Inquiry in response to the release of the Nauru  files is quite simply not enough.    

  “This has reached crisis level and requires an immediate response.” said Toby O’Brien, former Child Protection  Officer with Save the Children. “The evidence is already overwhelmingly clear.”   

 Many of the former staff have already made submissions and given evidence to a number of inquiries,  investigations and reviews.    

 ’’We’ve given evidence and it’s been ignored.’’ said Natasha Reid, Case Manager with Broadspectrum until  February 2015, ‘’No change has occurred for the men we worked with since the last Senate Inquiry. The camp  is not safer, conditions have not improved, the physical and mental decline of those held continues.”   

 Charlotte Wilson, who worked in case management on both Nauru and Manus Island over a period of 1.5  years, said “The Nauru files are damning in their truth, and they are not exclusive to Nauru. The men on Manus  are being harmed just as frequently and severely.”   

 “I watched these children’s lives being destroyed by these camps,” said Katie Price, Former Child and Youth  Recreation Officer, was employed on Nauru with Save the Children for almost two years. “They went from  energetic, cheeky, normal kids to completely devoid of all emotion. I recall one 7-year-old child towards the  end having a complete breakdown. She collapsed, screaming and kicking and crying for 20 minutes, completely  incoherent and would not let go of me. “   

 Shivani Keecha, who was the Coordinator of Save the Children’s Child Protection team on Nauru until October  2015, wants to see immediate action taken. “This cannot continue. I worked on Nauru while several previous  investigations and inquiries were held. Nothing changed. It was already too little too late. We don’t need more  evidence. We know these centres cause unacceptable harm. We need to bring these people to Australia and  start the process of rebuilding their lives.’’   

 Hayley Ballinger, Unaccompanied Minor Residential Worker and Child Protection Caseworker with Save the  Children until April 2015 said ‘’I implore the public and the Government to remember these are people. Kind,  ambitious, strong, imaginative, clever, nurturing, loving, real people who are being systemically broken.”   

 “They are truly the bravest souls I have ever met, and they deserve a future free from further harm.” said Ms  Ballinger.   

 Chris Lougheed, Deputy Education Manager with Save the Children, who personally reviewed and submitted a  great many incident reports such as those published in the Nauru files, condemned the Minister’s claims that  the reports were ‘hype’ and demanded he took responsibility. ‘’These reports are accurate observations  written by experienced professionals.”    

 “People are in immediate danger. Too much time has already passed. The Australian government must take  responsibility and bring them here immediately.” said Mr Lougheed.
