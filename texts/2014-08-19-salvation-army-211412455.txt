 Manus Island Arrests 

 

 

 The Salvation Army is aware of reports today two people have been arrested and charged over  the death of asylum seeker Reza Berati.   

 This is a matter for local Papua New Guinean (PNG) authorities only to investigate and  prosecute.   

 The Salvation Army has still not been approached by any PNG authorities regarding this matter  and remains ready, willing and able to be of assistance to their work if they feel it would be of  benefit to their investigation.   

 The Salvation Army will not be making any further comments.
