 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - CANBERRA, 3 DECEMBER 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Helen Coonan; Asylum seeker policy; Border protection; Pilot Photo IDs

 CREAN: Senator Coonan still has some significant answering to do today.  Yesterday the Prime Minister said that she would be making a statement in the Senate.  Apart from the fact that points of order were taken to prevent her from having to answer questions in the Parliament, her statement last night is just totally unsatisfactory.  It does not answer key allegations.

 The Prime Minister now has a responsibility to demand a full statement from Senator Coonan, and for the Prime Minister himself to report to the House of Representatives that he is satisfied that nothing wrong has been done.  These are serious allegations.  She is the Minister for Taxation, and there are allegations involving tax avoidance within family arrangements.

 There are also serious allegations about whether she has witnessed an enrolment form that may be false.  You know the consequences of these things in terms of parliamentarians in other jurisdictions.  They are no less serious here, but the Prime Minister has to treat them seriously.  The Parliament deserves full answers, and we will be insisting on them.

 JOURNALIST: Should the Prime Minister conduct an inquiry?

 CREAN: The Prime Minister needs to satisfy himself.  Yesterday’s performance by the Prime Minister was just totally unsatisfactory.  Clearly he was not aware and hadn’t acquainted himself with the facts.  He’s now had 24 hours in which the allegations have been made public.  He needs to come to the Parliament fully briefed to inform us fully.

 JOURNALIST: She argues, though, that her husband does have separate financial arrangements.  Isn’t it a bit old-fashioned to expect her to be responsible for her husband’s affairs.

 CREAN: I can understand that argument.  The trouble is, if those arrangements were entered into, she had to be part of them.  That’s the point.

 2

 It’s not that these arrangements of themselves can’t be made, but can they be made - or should they be made - if they are for the purposes of avoiding taxation when she’s the Minister for Taxation.  What sort of a signal does that send to the Australian public?  She’s the Minister for collecting revenue.  She’s the one out there saying that people shouldn’t be avoiding tax.  She’s the one overseeing arrangements to increase taxation, and yet the allegation is that there’s involvement in tax avoidance arrangements - very serious indeed.

 JOURNALIST: You’re actually going further, aren’t you?  Aren’t you saying that she, are you suggesting that she actually also lied on the enrolment form in witnessing his enrolment?

 CREAN: We’ve asked that question and this, of course, is not addressed by her in her response last night.  Now, if he has enrolled in the other address, but didn’t live there, that has implications for him.  But what about the person who’s witnessed the form, if the witness knew that the living [arrangement] was not going to take place?  That’s the nature of the allegation, and they have to be answered.  Now, she was asked this question a number of times in the Senate yesterday and she hasn’t answered them.  And if you look at her statement last night that came out at, what, at 10 o’clock last night, 10 o’clock last night, and didn’t even address this point.  So there are serious questions to be asked.

 You might be aware that when the Prime Minister was asked that question about the enrolment, he closed Question Time down and went out quite angrily.  Now, the Prime Minister has to come back into the Parliament and answer that allegation too.  I don’t know why Senator Coonan can’t answer the questions. They’re legitimate questions to ask.  No one’s suggesting the questions shouldn’t be asked.  They are allegations made by way of newspaper reports.  They’re entitled to be pursued on the detail in the Parliament.  We have done that. We’re patient, we’re prepared to wait for the answers, but we want the answers.

 JOURNALIST: Do you expect any opposition to your immigration policies at Caucus today?

 CREAN: There will be opposition to aspects.  This has always been the issue, in relation to asylum seekers, within our party.  But we’ve had very extensive consultations over the course of the year.  We’ve also made some significant changes to the policy that we took to the last election.  For example, we indicated from January that we would be taking the kids out from behind the razor wire.  We said that we would be closing Woomera.  We have said that the running of the detention facilities should be returned to the Australian Protective Services.  We said that the facilities should be more open to scrutiny in the way in which they are run.  We have said that we don’t support the Government on the excision of all of those islands around the Australian coastline.  Now that being said - significant progress made in terms of our policy - but there are important issues still to be resolved and the Shadow Cabinet has determined a position.  It will be taking that to the Caucus today.  The Caucus needs time to consider it.  The debate will commence today and it will conclude on Thursday.

 JOURNALIST: Where’s your alternative vision, though, when the Government is also preparing to release children from behind the barbed wire?

 CREAN: The Government, they still haven’t done it twelve months, almost, after I called for it. But it is more than that. What we have got to get to is a situation in which people are treated humanely when they are in the detention facilities and, importantly, that they are processed quickly and that alternate forms of detention supervision are investigated. We don’t argue against, I don’t argue against the need for mandatory detention - detention when people first arrive here without any papers, without any health checks, without any security checks - there needs to be detention to establish their status. But the conditions under which they are held and the length of time it takes to make those assessments, obviously, is an area for review.

 JOURNALIST: How can you get it all wrapped up in 90 days, though, and exhaust all of the appeals processes? Is that something you are looking at, limiting the appeals process?

 CREAN: No, we have indicated that there will be an appeal process, a one-stop-shop appeal process. But we are confident on all of the consultations that we have had that the 90 day processing can be established for the vast majority of cases, and I don’t know why the Government hasn’t been prepared to look at this. But perhaps after we release our policy they will. It might take them some time, it might take them twelve months, but they will see that this is sound policy, it’s a faster process, it’s a fairer process but, importantly, it doesn’t compromise our commitment to tough border protection.

 And, importantly, if you look at that question of border protection, we have actually strengthened it. We have strengthened it with the Coastguard. The issue here is not the compromising of our national security - that has to be paramount. That being said, the conditions under which asylum seekers are processed and held does need to be reviewed. And Labor will do it.  It will do it in a fair way and it will make the process faster. And I think that is important all round.

 The other thing that we will argue very strongly is that this has to be done in an international context as well. We have got to stop the means by which people can country hop, hoping for better assessment procedures. There has to be an internationally consistent definition for the assessment for the determination of asylum seeker status. What we need to do is hasten the process so that people are not endlessly kept inside detention facilities as they are under this Government. There is a better way.  There is a decent way to do this, and that is what Labor will be proposing.

 JOURNALIST: But given the uncertain times that we live in, do you think your ideas will have general public support given that everyone is concerned about potential terrorism and you are talking about 90 day mandatory detention?

 CREAN: I think it is important to address the concerns about security and the threats from terror. And that is why our prime concern has to be the securing of our borders, national defence, national security. And that is why we have been putting forward constructive initiatives in that regard: the Coastguard; the Department of Homeland Affairs; a Director of National Security; also the Regional Summit, in terms of getting together with our neighbours - not threatening our neighbours - but actually working with them to counter terror.

 JOURNALIST: But how do you convince the public that this is the way to go, given that everyone is really concerned about terrorism?

 CREAN: I think by putting forward constructive initiatives that actually strengthen our borders and give us greater self-sufficiency, greater confidence and a greater commitment in the national interest to protecting our citizens. I will not only engage that debate, I will continue to put forward constructive initiatives, as I have done.

 There is then the other dimension of how we treat people who are here seeking asylum. And that, I am saying, can be done in a way that is more decent, that is faster and is more humane.  And that is what the Australian public is looking for. It is not one or the other. It is the question of being able to address both. And this Government only wants to talk tough on national security and avoid obligations. Why won’t it pick up the argument for a Coastguard? It makes sense. We haven’t got a cop on the beat. But it wants to talk tough on national security and it is not treating people in the facilities humanely. And I think that their statement today is an acknowledgement - twelve months late - that they have got it wrong on the kids. But they have got it wrong in other areas as well. And Labor will show the way forward in a fairer, more humane way, but one that does not compromise the national interest.

 JOURNALIST: They’re talking this morning of asking for photo ID for all pilots. It is that a bit tardy, considering September 11 was over a year ago?

 CREAN: Well, again, I think this is the big problem for the Government. Over twelve, fourteen months ago, September 11 happened. The Government said it was reviewing a whole lot of airport security, but we find out fourteen months later that there is no x-rays on baggage equipment.  What is it that now justifies us putting that in that didn’t fourteen months ago?  And the same with photo IDs for pilots. I mean, this is just another example of the Government wanting to be out there talking tough on the need to protect our citizens, but not following up on the detail. This is a Government that consistently mouths rhetoric and never follows through on the detail.
