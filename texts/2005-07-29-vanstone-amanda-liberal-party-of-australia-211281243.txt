  AUSTRALIA AGREES TO RESETTLE UZBEK REFUGEES 

  Australia will resettle up to 50 Uzbek refugees, Minister for Immigration, Amanda  Vanstone, announced today. 

  “The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has expressed  concern about approximately 450 Uzbek nationals and sought Australia’s assistance  in resettling these refugees,” the Minister said. 

  “Australia has responded with an offer to resettle up to 50 people under our Refugee  and Humanitarian Program. 

  “The UNHCR says these people fled Uzbekistan to neighbouring Kyrgyzstan after  security authorities reportedly used indiscriminate force against unarmed civilians. 

  “These Uzbek refugees are under increasing risk of being sent back to Uzbekistan  and last week the UN High Commissioner formally requested Australia and other key  resettlement countries to help resolve their situation. 

  “As on many other occasions in the past, Australia has responded positively to  UNHCR’s call to resolve a refugee situation. 

  “The flexible nature of our Humanitarian Program enables us to respond to a  resettlement situation from any part of the world, where it is needed. 

  “Australia will share the overall responsibility with other resettlement countries  including the US and Canada, 

  “Australia is one of 10 countries with well established resettlement programs and  consistently ranks with the United Sates and Canada amongst the top three countries  in the numbers resettled each year.”
