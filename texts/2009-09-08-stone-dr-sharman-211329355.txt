 ARRIVAL OF 29TH BOAT ONCE AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS LABOR’S FLAWED  STANCE 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Another boat, carrying seven asylum seekers and one crew member, was intercepted near the Ashmore Islands 

 yesterday.  

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said the stream of boats continued to make 

 their way down the pipeline from Indonesia while the Rudd Government twiddled its thumbs.  

 “Since the Rudd Government softened its immigration policy in August 2008, 29 boats carrying 1301 asylum 

 seekers have been intercepted in Australian waters heading for the mainland,” Dr Stone said.  

 “People smugglers know they will have ready clients given the new good deal in Australia and the Government is 

 helping them market their trade. This is despite the unseaworthy vessels and real dangers they face at sea.”  

 “Once again, I call on the Rudd Government to launch an independent inquiry into the relationship between its 

 softened stance on immigration management and the surge of people smuggled into Australia over the last 12 

 months.”  

 “How many more boats and tragedies at sea will occur before the Rudd Government admits its weakened border 

 protection measures have failed?  

 “The Rudd Government continues to send a clear message to people smugglers that Australia’s back door is 

 wide open.”
