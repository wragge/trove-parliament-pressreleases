 Media Centre  International Women’s Day  

 8 March 2006 

 This International Women’s Day is a great opportunity to draw attention  to the plight of vulnerable refugee women and children and Australia’s  efforts to help them, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Andrew Robb, said today.  

 ‘The life of a single female in a refugee camp is very hard and women  often face violence and torture, ‘ Mr Robb said. 

 ‘Under the Woman at Risk program, a special category under the  Humanitarian Program, in response to concerns from the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) about the plight of women  and children refugees.  

 ‘The program aims to assist women and their children who are subject to  persecution, are living outside their home country and do not have the  protection of a male relative.  

 ‘In cooperation with the UNHCR, we help these families resettle and  rebuild their lives in Australia free from the constant threat of danger and  violence, ‘ Mr Robb said. 

 Since the introduction of the Woman at Risk program more than 6000  visas have been granted. In 2004-05 about 840 visas were granted to  women and children refugees under the program.  

 ‘A large proportion of these visas were granted to Liberian female-headed  families from Guinea, many of whom survived horrific events and whose  husbands have disappeared or been killed, often in front of their eyes, ‘  said Mr Robb. 

 Australia’s Humanitarian Program focuses on those in the greatest need  of resettlement, with a very significant proportion of humanitarian visas  granted to women and children in 2004-05. 

 ‘Australians can be justifiably proud of our record in helping refugees and  people in need to resettle in Australia under the Humanitarian Program.  As part of this program, the Woman at Risk category helps refugee 

 women and children to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, ‘ Mr Robb  added.
