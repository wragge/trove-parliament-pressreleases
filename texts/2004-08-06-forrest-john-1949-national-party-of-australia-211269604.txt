  Expansion to services for newly arrived migrants and refugees 

  John Forrest the Federal Member for Mallee today welcomed the announcement by the  Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, on the expansion of the Reconnect  and Job Placement, Employment and Training (JPET) program. 

  “The expansion of the Reconnect and Job Placement, Employment and Training (JPET)  program will see new services located in areas where there are high levels of settlement  by young newly arrived migrants and refugees,” said Mr Forrest. 

  “These programs have been highly successful in providing support, counselling and basic  life skills, as well as education, training and work opportunities. 

  “Importantly, the services give young people the opportunity to stabilise their lives and  make positive changes in the community. Young newly arrived migrants and refugees  will certainly benefit from this support. Given the increased multicultural focus of our  Murray River towns, this funding is very welcome,” Mr Forrest said. 

  “The Australian Government will allocate around $222 000 in funding for the Murray River  Region over four years. The new service will focus on the Murray River region,  specifically Greater Shepparton, Albury, Mildura, Griffith and the surrounding areas. 

  “All existing JPET and Reconnect services in the Murray River Region will be invited to  apply for funding.” 

  “Some migrants and refugees find themselves struggling to adapt to the Australian way of  life, the language and culture - these services can help them make a smooth transition  into the community,” said Mr Forrest. 

  “The Australian Government is committed to helping young people who are at risk of  falling through the gaps. JPET and Reconnect are two highly successful programs that  are working across Australia to ensure young people are supported.” 

  FaCS expects to invite organisations to apply in this area in late September 2004.
