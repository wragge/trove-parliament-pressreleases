 NEWS RELEASE

 26 April 1988

 Emergency aid for Mozambican refugees in Malawi

 Australia would provide a contribution of $500 000 to the Australian  voluntary agency, AUSTCARE, for emergency assistance to Mozambican  refugees in Malawi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Bill  Hayden, M.P., anounced today.

 Australia is also contributing $500 000 to a Special Appeal of the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for assistance to  Mozambican returnees and refugees.

 The United Nations estimate that up to 750 000 Mozambicans have fled  their country as a result of internal disruption caused by the insurgency  group, RENAMO, and further worsened by drought.

 Mr Hayden said that UN estimates put the number of Mozambicans in  Malawi at 450 000 with the number increasing at the rate of 15-20 000 each  month.The refugees are arriving in Malawi with vntuaflyâno possessions and  no clothes.

 Malawi is one of the world's poorest countries which has also been suffering  from a recent drought. However, the Malawi Government has been  accepting refugees since 1986, placing an enormous burden on its meagre  resources.

 "The funds for AUSTCARE would be used to purchase cloth in Zimbabwe for  the making of clothing and for distribution to 60 000 refugees in Malawi  under the supervision of the Malawi Red Cross Society," Mr Hayden said.

 The funds for UNHCR will assist not only Mozambican refugees in Malawi but  also those in other neighbouring countries, as well as helping returnees  resettle in Mozambique

 A contribution of $100 000 was also made earlier this month to the  voluntary agency, CARE Australia, for truck transport in Mozambique.

 These announcements bring total Australian assistance to Mozambique and  Mozambican refugees to $11.367 million this financial year.

 The response to the Mozambique emergency is part of the Government's  humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian International  Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).

 [BILL HAYDEN / - INTERVIEWED BY MICHAEL PASCOE, FINANCE EDITOR â 

 BUSINESS SUNDAY 17.4.88

 Mr Hayden w e ’ve just cut our car industry protection, we look 

 to be having a general cut in tariffs in the May Statement - 

 Are we out of step with our major trade partners in reducing 

 protectionism?

 HAYDEN -  .

 I don’t believe so, in general terms. I think there is a need 

 in Australia to get our levels of our protection down. With 

 the devaluation which took place, no doubt there's been a 

 revaluation in currency more recently, but the devaluation 

 gave extraordinary additional protection to Australian industry 

 and I suspect quite subjectively, of course, that’s part of 

 the reason why investment levels didn't take off the way a lot 

 of us were hoping they would. Although investment is improving 

 now, and my overall impression over many years, actually, but 

 reinforced since I've been in this job, is that too much of 

 Australian industry is not prepared to take an entrepreneurial 

 risk in the outside world markets, and the reason is that 

 industry's had a fairly safe passage for a long time with high 

 levels of protection.

 PASCOE -But is a reduction of protection here, a bargaining, point with 

 the Japanese and Koreans - or is there no mileage in. it whatso­

 ever?

 HAYDEN -

 PASCOE

 I don't think a reduction in protection in Australia is such a 

 large bargaining point. With either of those countries, we're 

 relatively a small market, in particular for the Japanese ....

 PAGE 2 - HAYDEN - PASCOE

 I think it*s just good commercial healthiness for us to get 

 our industry in a honed-down efficient competitive condition.

 And I'm very much for more open markets, although not 

 necessarily free trade. I think free trade is perhaps a 

 bit too severe for Australia.

 I should say LhsL alLliuuyli we have a very high level Of 

 protection in this country. Australian protection's quite 

 transparent, it's almost exclusively in tariffs, and represents 

 no where near the problem of course for exporting countries 

 wanting to penetrate our markets,, that things like quotas do. And 

 its I n ^ r i a s  where we tend to be disadvantaged in the main commodities 

 that we're selling beef for instance.

 PASCOE -We seemed to have been disadvantaged on several fronts in Tokyo 

 of late. Beginning with coal .. Have we given up any idea of 

 sending coal negotiators back, or is that still a possibility? 

 HAYDEN -Well, Mr Kerin's in charge of price negotiations on this matter 

 and what he said is that he would wait for the full package to 

 come in, and part of that full package of course were the 

 settlements on semi-hard coking coal and the return there's been 

 much better at $3.90 a tonne, plus extra tonnages, but we're 

 still waiting for the final picture. What I have to say though, 

 there is no doubt on. my view having been in Tokyo several days 

 last week and engaged in. negotiations, on. this matter .. that we 

 were very much confronted by a monopist position in. the part of 

 Japan, that is, the Japanese steel mills operate with an. organised 

 common front. So that you have one organised buyer, effectively 

 confronted by a number of eager and competitive sellers, which 

 means that you do have a disadvantage.

 Hence, the Prime Minister's very firm statement, that we were 

 treated unfairly. We're not treated unfairly in a market 

 place where competitive market conditions prevail on both sides. 

 PASCOE -But isn't the reality is that we're just going to have to take 

 it anyway?

 HAYDEN -Well, let's weigh up the overall package, and as I say,

 Mr Kerin's has said that is what he is in the presence of doing.

 He handles that area .. not me .. He will report to Cabinet 

 fairly soon .. maybe this coming week, but not too far off.

 So we can make a decision one way or the other. But I think the 

 package overall's got to weight up in. our, to our benefit.

 And I think the very firm protest we were making in. Tokyo didn't 

 go unheeded in the light of subsequent settlements. Can I make 

 the point too, that I breached very strongly with the Japanese... 

 In the country, 3,500 miners jobs have gone since December, 1986 

 and 16 mines have closed down. Now we just can't keep going in 

 that direction. And the Japanese have to recognise that.

 PASCOE -Mr Hayden, what's the reality though, of the reception we're 

 receiving in Japan on Mr Kerin's move. They're not looking back 

 to shades of Rex Connor, are they?

 HAYDEN -

 Ah .. well, I wasn't quite a fan of the way in which things 

 were done by Rex Connor. I have to confess, and I don't believe 

 anyone's proposing a return to that highly interventous role 

 that the late Rex Connor conducted, but I think if y ou’re 

 confronted by a monopist on one side and on your side disorganised 

 competitive eager sellers , you've got a problem, I'm not sure

 PPL 17 '38 10:44 TCN NINE NEWS STILL THE ONE ! P.4

 PAGE 4 ~ HAYDEN' - PASCOE

 how we sought that out, but Mr Kerin, has been, addressing himself 

 to this. I spoke to him on t h e ·phone a few times .. and will 

 be coming back to Cabinet, I can't say anymore until he comes 

 to CAbinet, and a decision's taken.

 PASCOE - '

 Final brief question on coal.

 isn't the real problem, not the disunity among the Australian 

 miners, but the international mining market that Australian 

 miners have played off against the Canadians, South Africans 

 the Chinese and Americans.

 HAYDEN -

 Well in most cases, Australian, pricing- is highly competitive.

 We offer high quality coal at cheaper rates than, most other 

 countries. China is and will increasingly become a problem, 

 because they'llbe prepared to unload large volumes of coal 

 for the sake of getting external currency rather than, representing 

 a true cost-price.

 PASCOE -

 But don't we need some sort of- organisation among all coal miners, 

 not just Australia being unified against the world.

 HAYDEN -­

 Well I just don't think that's feasible. I ’ve never seen those 

 producer-seller cartel work, or work for long when they've been, 

 put together. I think we've got to look after ourselves.

 PASCOE -

 Is there anymore-sign, of joy in the beef- front then?

 HAYDEN - .

 I think there is some encouragement -  there .. I came away with 

 some sense of hope about beef in the case of Japan, not Korea,

 -APL 17 '88 10:45 TCN NINE NEWS STILL.THE ONE ! P.5

 PAGE 5 ~ PASCOE - HAYDEN

 Korea are very limited. Japan, either'  they-' re going to open, up 

 as a result of pressure, mainlyâ coming from the United States ...

 What you said earlier is correct .. the amount of muscle we can 

 bring to there .. is relatively limited. And I trust of course 

 the American are hot going to do any bi-lateral deals at our dis­

 advantage . We receive guarantees from both Japan, and the United 

 State, it w o n ’t happen .. Or alternatively, we will be forced to .  

 take the GATT route, and we have put a number of steps in place 

 so that if it is necessary to take the GATT route, take Japan, 

 to a panel, then we everything ready to do that ... In the case 

 of Korea, they're going to open up their market in. the coming 

 year with the high quantity cuts only .. we want it liberalised 

 across the board. And there is. a fear that they are. only going 

 to open it up for the period of t h e .Olympic Games and after that 

 the opportunity might come up. Now, we are. in. fact well down the 

 road to putting in. place· GATT procedures, in the .  case of Korea.

 PASCOE -Our trade rhetoric over the past couple of decades has been, based 

 very much on a partnership with Japan.. Is that a. myth, is that 

 dead?. Could we have a lot more to gain really by perhaps making bi­

 lateral agreements with the United States becoming part of that bloc. 

 HAYDEN -No I'm not too sure what you have in mind Michael, when you" talk 

 about bi-lateral agreements with the. United States... But there used 

 to be a lot of nonsense spoken..in my view about a special relation­

 ship with Japan. There is this element ,  of: sentimentality on the 

 part of Australia, as though people have a natural instinctive 

 affection for us. In. the commercial world it's tough and its hard 

 and its competitive and a fair bit of clout is brought to

 PAGE 6 -- HAYDEN - PASCOE

 bare - from time to time# which can often override market 

 considerations.

 For instance,, both Korea and Japan are exporting about 

 40 per cent of their total exports to the United States 

 and both have trade surpluses there. That gives the 

 United States enormous leverage over them. We're not "  

 in .that sort of league at all. What we've go to do is 

 compalin and argue and seek to persuade and gather multi­

 lateral route as muc as we can. Pack up all these sorts 

 of things. But outside, of that, and be competitive, of 

 course, and a reliable supplier, which is something that 

 must be understood industriallyi But outside of that, .

 we are not able to muster much in. the way of muscle.

 PASCOE - .

 Because we're not part of a major block, there's no future 

 for Australia joining a Canadian/U.S . trade relationship,

 HAYDEN - â 

 Well, I can't see that prospect .. Anyway I think it would be 

 unwise for us to be talking out aloud about that, when we've been 

 running around the world moralising-about multi-lateralism .

 in markets. But can I say this to you ... I do understand 

 the point you're making .. and I think it is a .verytelling one.

 With New Zealand not part of a natural trading bloc .. Canada 

 will always be looked after by the United States. The small 

 trading countries of Europe, like Holland and Belgium and so on, 

 will always be looked after by the European Community. But we 

 and New Zealand are out here by ourselves.. it's going to be 

 a tough hard and often cold road for us to be travelling on, 

 and we've just got to work damn hard, and it's got to be under 

 stood right across the board. Employer^and employee representatives

 have got to understand, it doesn't take much to put to fright 

 some of our major markets. I still have said to me, or have 

 expressions of concern about' the industrial relations situation 

 in this country when 1 was in Korea for instance.

 PASCOE ~

 Mr Hayden, much closer to home, while you were away, yet more 

 soul searching about the ALP perhaps losing touch with its 

 fundamentals, its roots ... In that context, is there a danger 

 that the privatisation debate is becoming for the Labor Party 

 what the consumption tax issue is for the Opposition?

 HAYDEN -­

 Well, I'm not quite sure what -  fundamentals are ... sounds rather 

 a naughty word to me. But, well., I don't see any evidence of 

 that ... and the privatisation:debate seems to me to be handled 

 fairlyjdiscreetly, except for an initial flurry.

 Is an occasional, on. the point of public statement, but· one must 

 expect this. And I think what wi've got to make clear is this 

 is part of the process of open, and democratic.· debate to resolve 

 what is rather a big issue in the party. If you're inviting 

 me to comment on. it I don't propose to.

 PASCOE -Well, we seem to have the Prime Minister talking about economic 

 miracles in the same week that the Victorian. Labor P a r t y .  

 conference yesterday's again talking -  about losing touch with 

 the fundamentals. There's a bit of conflict there, .

 HAYDEN - .

 I think they're two separate things.â  I think that the way the '  '  â  

 economy has been going has really been, quite remarkable. The  H AV6

 alternative to what Keating has done would have been, to/xcrunched

 it quite severely with a rather orthodox recession imposed on, 

 or contraction I should say imposed on the economy that we've ·  

 achieved nothing·and certainly would have discouraged investment 

 to allow restructuring to go on. :

 Instead of that Paul’s brought about massive increase in jobs, 

 growth in the economy, profits- for business and the opportunity .  

 for this restructuring. .

 Now that's one thing, an improvement:in commodity prices is going 

 to be a big help here. But the other thing is an internal thing, 

 its a matter of ideaology about value systems in the party ..

 Do you or don't you agree in public enterprise to a great or :  

 lesser extent. Completely or not at all. And I don't think 

 its got anything to do with that... miracles or just man made
