  Australia, 
Indonesia and East Timor - Moving Forward

  Speech 
by the Hon Alexander Downer, MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the 
Asian Studies Association of Australia   
Brisbane, 29 October 1999

  Introduction

  It is a great pleasure to be able to address this 
meeting organised by the Asian Studies Association of Australia. The 
Association does a fine job in keeping Australians aware of developments 
in our region, and in doing so helps create the environment for a more 
informed and balanced debate within Australia on our relations with 
the countries of Asia.

  I was particularly happy to accept Bob Elson's invitation 
to come here because it gives me the opportunity to talk about Australia's 
relations with Indonesia and East Timor. I do so just days after two 
historic votes in Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly, the MPR: 
one to elect Abdurrahman Wahid as President, and the other to revoke 
the 1978 decree incorporating East Timor into Indonesia.

  These decisions were possible because Indonesia has 
been undergoing a profound transition in a largely positive direction. 
The trigger for the transition was the ending of the Soeharto administration, 
which the East Asian economic crisis helped to precipitate. His departure, 
while revealing some of the weaknesses of the system he had built -- 
in particular the weakness of institutions and of a mechanism for a 
smooth transition -- also opened new possibilities. Indonesia was free 
to hold democratic elections. And it was able to examine in a fresh 
way some of the long-standing tenets of the Soeharto regime, in particular 
its approach to the East Timor question.

  Indonesia's democratic transition and East Timor's 
separation from Indonesia on the basis of a clearly expressed will of 
its people are both crucially important events for Australia. Let me 
state plainly that we regard both as offering Australia new opportunities 
to help establish a strong, realistic and more sustainable relationship 
with our largest neighbour: a relationship based on mutual respect. 
They also offer the people of Indonesia and East Timor the opportunity 
to put the past behind them, and build a better future.

  Our support for Indonesia's historic 
change

  Australia has been a firm and consistent supporter 
of Indonesia's efforts to move to a democratic government. We contributed 
to the preparations for the general elections - both technically and 
financially. And we have helped through the aid program to assist in 
ameliorating the worst effects of the economic crisis and to build democratic 
institutions thereby creating a better environment in which the election 
could be held.

  We warmly welcome the installation of the new government 
in Indonesia. President Abdurrahman Wahid is a respected figure in Indonesia; 
he is an inclusive figure; he is a man of tolerance. At a time when 
Indonesia needs to overcome divisions and conflicts, he is the man of 
the hour.

  The combination of President Abdurrahman Wahid and 
Vice-President Megawati Soekarno Putri should serve Indonesia very well. 
Together they represent important strands of the Indonesian polity: 
nationalism and Traditionalist Islam. But the government is broader 
than just that. Modernist Muslims have a prominent place too. It includes 
members of the major political parties which contested the election 
and is, in many ways, a government of national unity.

  It is also a cabinet which has some unique and welcome 
features. For the first time in Indonesian history a civilian - the 
well respected Dr Juwono Sudarsono - is Minister for Defence. For the 
first time in Indonesian history, a Navy officer is TNI commander. An 
Irianese is in cabinet for the first time. An ethnic Chinese Indonesian 
holds the senior position of Coordinating Minister for Finance and Industry. 
There are new ministers for Human Rights and for Regional Autonomy.

  All this reflects a government which shows every 
sign of being serious about tackling Indonesia's many complex problems. 
In this context, I was encouraged to hear confirmation from the new 
Coordinating Minister for Finance and Industry that Indonesia will adhere 
to its agreements with the IMF.

  We wish all the members of 
the new government well. We will support them, including through our 
aid program, which is focused towards encouraging good governance, the 
development of civil society, human rights and poverty alleviation.

  We have been encourag  ed by our initial dealings with the new Indonesian 
government. There is much goodwill we can draw upon as we build the 
relationship together.

  Our ambassador, John McCarthy, had a positive discussion 
with President Abdurrahman Wahid on Wednesday. The President welcomed 
recent Australian government statements on Indonesia and confirmed that 
he wished to see an improvement in the bilateral relationship. He has 
already given some thought to areas in which we might move forward and 
we will be discussing this further with the new government in the period 
ahead.

  Of course, this is very much a two-way relationship. 
We want to work in tandem with the new Indonesian government as we go 
forward. And we will do so on the basis of mutual respect. We have much 
to offer, just as we have much to gain.

  We intend - both our countries - to restore our relationship 
in a careful, measured way. There are bruised feelings on both sides 
which will take a little time to diminish. But there are also vital 
and productive links between our two communities - in business, education 
and the friendships of ordinary people in ordinary ways. All these can, 
in a short time, ease the path towards a fuller relationship between 
us.

  And in due course we would expect that the range 
of dealings between our governments will again be in good working order.

  I want now to discuss East Timor - both in the context 
of our policy over the past year, and what we hope for East Timor in 
the future. It is a subject worthy of discussion in its own right. But 
it also bears on our past and future relationship with Indonesia.

  Australia's role in East Timor

  When I look at all that our country has done in relation 
to East Timor's transition to independence, I believe that there is 
much of which Australians can be proud. We have worked for an equitable 
solution to the troubles in the territory, a solution that will best 
serve the interests of the East Timorese and Indonesian peoples. We 
have backed our good will with practical assistance. And when it has 
been needed, Australians have placed their own lives on the line.

  In late 1998, Prime Minister Howard wrote to then-President 
Habibie on the question of East Timor. He suggested an extended period 
of autonomy for the East Timorese and an eventual act of self-determination 
- actually not a new approach. It had often been discussed in the context 
of solutions to East Timor. Dr Habibie decided not to precede the act 
of self-determination by a long period of autonomy. He opted instead 
for a process that would resolve East Timor's status, one way or another, 
by the end of 1999. The leaders of the East Timorese welcomed the decision. 
Australia and the international community welcomed the decision. What 
Dr Habibie proposed was a chance for the East Timorese to decide between 
autonomy within Indonesia and independence.

  Since that time Australia has worked hard to help 
the process proceed in an efficient and peaceful way. We did more than 
our fair share in helping UNAMET in its task. We have certainly borne 
a disproportionate burden within INTERFET. We are happy to have done 
so. We believe that our leadership was necessary, our contribution was 
necessary. But we don't own UNAMET, or INTERFET, or any other aspect 
of the United Nations's operations.

  I also want to make some comments about halting the 
violence in East Timor, because I believe that the true value of the 
effort Australia put in from the outset to curb violence in the territory 
has been obscured. In an understandable reaction to the horrific scenes 
broadcast on our television screens, some people have asked why our 
Government did not foresee trouble, and act to have peacekeepers in 
East Timor   before  the ballot. 
Such criticism is wrong.

  It is wrong because we   did  take action 
long before the autonomy vote. You will all probably recall the Summit 
Meeting on East Timor held between Mr Howard and Dr Habibie on the island 
of Bali on 27 April. What many people seem to have forgotten is that 
the Summit was called to address an outbreak of violence that had hit 
the territory in the earlier part of the month.

  At that meeting, when these 
issues were discussed very frankly, Dr Habibie agreed to boost the number 
of civilian police in the pre- and post-ballot periods in East Timor. 
Although the Prime Minister pressed for peace keeping forces, President 
Habibie said   categorically that Indonesia would not accept them, 
a position that had also been made clear during the negotiations on 
the Tripartite Agreement.

  Given those circumstances, there was absolutely no 
prospect of UN or international endorsement of peacekeeping forces. 
If we had pushed the matter, the ballot would not have proceeded. Indonesia 
had made that clear. And for armed force to be used unilaterally against 
Indonesia would have been foolish and an abrogation of fundamental tenets 
of international law - and it would not have achieved anything positive.

  Australia, like many other interested parties, received 
a large number of reports on the potential for post-ballot violence 
in East Timor. Many indicated that there would be significant problems, 
while others said there would not. We were concerned about those reports, 
and constantly called on the Indonesian Government to halt violence 
in East Timor - and, don't forget, security was   Indonesia's  responsibility 
under the Tripartite Agreement.

  We also worked hard just before the vote to heighten 
international awareness of the risks involved, urged the UN to keep 
the maximum number of its officials and volunteers on the ground for 
as long as possible, and worked to ensure that departing UN officials 
were replaced by increased numbers of Civpol and MLOs. Some months before 
we had begun to bring our armed forces to a higher degree of readiness, 
so that Australia could include its forces in a peacekeeping operation 
with Indonesian consent, should worst-case scenarios eventuate.

  Once the nature and extent of the violence in East 
Timor became apparent, Australia acted quickly in conjunction with others 
to persuade Indonesia of the importance of a force, and then to assemble 
it.

  I appreciate that many people in Australia were frustrated 
that the process could not be speeded up. But it was crucial that a 
firm consensus on the need for an international force should be built. 
In fact, when compared to UN action on Kosovo, agreement on the deployment 
of troops was reached relatively quickly and smoothly. I have been told 
by those who keep track of Security Council operations that the resolution 
on East Timor broke all records in its speed of adoption.

  INTERFET has been doing a magnificent job in East 
Timor, and every one of us should be proud of the roles played Australian 
by soldiers in that effort. Major General Peter Cosgrove has carried 
out his duties with a minimum of fuss, and maximum of effectiveness, 
as has every one of our 5000-odd troops in INTERFET. My colleague, the 
Defence Minister, Mr Moore, is today in Dili to pass on the genuine 
regard the Australian people have for our troops in the INTERFET operation.

  Some in the international media have chosen to make 
spurious allegations about the heavy-handedness of Australian troops. 
The pictures of the welcome they have been receiving around the territory 
show up the lack of truth in that claim. I regret that anti-independence 
militias have suffered casualties during INTERFET operations. But in 
every single case, Australian troops have not fired first. Far from 
being heavy-handed, our troops have acted with admirable restraint - 
especially when one recalls the extravagant threats that militia leaders 
made against INTERFET before its deployment. And we should not forget 
that two of our troops have been wounded in action while they have been 
showing that restraint.

  The indications are that INTERFET is clearly succeeding 
in its mission to restore peace and stability to East Timor. Displaced 
persons are returning to their homes. Refugees are crossing the border 
from West Timor. Houses are being rebuilt, and markets are reopening. 
These are early days yet, but progress is encouraging.

  We are also making progress in meeting the pressing 
humanitarian crisis in East and West Timor. Australia has led the way 
in helping get humanitarian assistance quickly to where it is most needed, 
and have made an initial commitment of A$13.7 million to that end. Darwin 
has become the jump-off point for the massive international relief operation 
now under way, and our aid officials are there to coordinate Australian 
efforts fully with those of the United Nations and other international 
aid agencies.

  The provision of aid will 
continue to be one of the most pressing tasks for the international 
community in East Timor in the weeks and months to come. Australia has 
been the main aid donor to East Timor in the past, and we intend to 
continue to work closel  y with the United Nations and others to ensure that 
urgent humanitarian needs in the territory are met.

  With the MPR having now revoked the decree incorporating 
East Timor into Indonesia, we will soon move into Phase III of the transition 
plan, which will put in place a full UN administration, to be known 
as the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor, or UNTAET. It will 
provide for both a civilian administration, and a UN peacekeeping organisation 
to replace INTERFET.

  I expect Australia to provide significant support 
to UNTAET, but that our support will be quite different from that provided 
to INTERFET. We will, for example, have less troops in the new peacekeeping 
organisation, which may well be commanded by someone other than an Australian. 
We are not seeking leadership, but have told Secretary-General Annan 
that we would be willing to assist in that regard, if need be.

  Australia also supports full investigation of all 
allegations of human rights abuses in East Timor. At present, both the 
Indonesian human rights organisation, Komnasham, and the United Nations 
have commenced preliminary investigations. The established procedures 
for investigating the alleged abuses must take their course.

  The loss of life in East Timor 
after the announcement of the resu  lt of the autonomy vote has underlined the need to 
act quickly when humanitarian disaster looms. With that in mind I have 
urged the United Nations to reconsider its approach to humanitarian 
intervention - in such circumstances, every day counts. It may take 
time to convince doubters at the UN, but I am convinced that a humanitarian 
and sensible compromise can be arranged on these issues, one that would 
allow much more rapid action to safeguard populations at significant 
risk.

  Australia, Indonesia and East 
Timor

  I now want to talk about Australia, Indonesia and 
East Timor - the future.

  First, we are neighbours and have to live together. 
We want to help East Timor get on its feet and become a fully-fledged 
member of the international community. But I want to underline both 
to East Timor and to Indonesia that we never have had - nor ever will 
have - hegemonistic designs on East Timor. We are not adventurist.

  Second, Indonesia has taken historic and courageous 
steps to allow a democratic process prevail in East Timor and the MPR 
has made an unambiguous decision to honour the outcome. There is now 
a break with the past. Both Indonesia and East Timor can make a new 
start. For Indonesia it means that the issue that had held it back on 
the global stage is now resolved. And of real importance for Australia, 
an issue which has been of concern to many Australians and which has 
been a cause of friction in our relations with Indonesia for a quarter 
of a century should now be on the way to resolution.

  Third, it is in Australia's overwhelming interest 
that Indonesia and East Timor enjoy good relations. We will encourage 
them to work towards that goal. It is in their interests, it is in our 
interests, it is in the region's interests. Conversely, the threat of 
violence, of discord, of discontent, is in no one's interests. We all 
want a secure and harmonious neighbourhood.

  Fourth, it is in the interests of East Timor, Australia 
and Indonesia that there be a process of national reconciliation in 
East Timor.

  Fifth, in looking to the future we have been encouraged 
and impressed by the good sense and magnanimity shown by President Abdurrahman 
Wahid in so many issues over the years. His decision to meet Xanana 
Gusmao when he was still in prison is an example of his humanity. His 
recent indication of a willingness to meet Xanana again is further testament 
to his goodwill. We hope that this spirit will continue to inform Indonesia's 
future dealings with East Timor.

  Sixth, Xanana Gusmao is also clearly a leader of 
real stature. He has shown courage and wisdom. His lack of bitterness 
and his commitment to good relations with Indonesia are to be commended. 
We encourage him also to work on the process of reconciliation within 
East Timor too.

  Conclusion

  The three of us - Indonesia, East Timor and Australia 
- will all have to work together. But I think that we can - the three 
of us - enter the new millennium with a clear conscience and with genuine 
hopes for the future.

  Australia had to make hard decisions. We respect 
Indonesia. It is a great nation and we know that many many people in 
Indonesia were saddened by the way in which events in East Timor unfolded.

  Indonesia, on the cusp of far-reaching political 
and social change, also made the wrenching decision to allow East Timor 
to separate. It is now embarking on new domestic and international courses 
under an enlightened and inspired man. Australia will be doing all it 
can to help the Indonesian Government and people satisfy their legitimate 
aspirations for greater democracy and freedom in their homeland.

  East Timor is rebuilding from the ashes, with help 
from its friends, under a courageous and imaginative fighter who persisted 
and who beat the odds.

  With such partners I am sure that we can work things 
out.
