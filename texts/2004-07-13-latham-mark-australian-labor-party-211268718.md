 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER   

 

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP AT CAFÃ NET GEN, VICTORIAN RAILWAY  INSTITUTE HALL  SEYMOUR, VICTORIA   

 TUESDAY, 13 JULY 2004  *E&OE **  Subjects:  Iraq Policy   

 LATHAM:  [inaudible] to verify the relevance and effectiveness of Labor  policy on mentoring and Youth Guarantee, on our early literacy strategy and  other aspects of our education policy so it is good to be in Seymour with our  candidate Jenny Beales talking to the service providers and understanding how  Labor will help in all those key areas for young people in the district but also  taking away some of the challenges about transport and mobility that we need to  build into our further policy responses in the future. Happy to answer any  questions.   

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Latham, just on your Iraq policy; if the United Nations  were to ask Australia for troops for a long-term peacekeeping mission, would you  agree? 

 

 LATHAM:  The Howard Government has said that - I think Mr Howard’s  words were that peacekeepers on the other side of the world wouldn’t be  Australia’s cup of tea. We agree with that assessment. We’ve made a statement  outlining our preparedness to sit down with the UN and talk about support,  personnel, logistics, planners, strategists, administrative support, to make sure  that the UN mission and the protective force there is a success. That’s the  commitment that we’ve got and that is where we’ll be headed in the future.   

 JOURNALIST:  The Prime Minister says your Iraq policy is confused because  you want to bring troops home but then 30 non-combatants there so who is  going to protect them, he is saying?   

 LATHAM:  There is the UN protective force that is being mustered  around the world. We don’t support the Coalition forces; we haven’t from day  one in Iraq, but we do support making a contribution through the UN, and that’s  the difference: Labor wants to make a contribution in Iraq. We always said that 

 we’d respond positively to a new United Nations’ resolution and last night I  outlined the four areas where we make that positive response - personnel, as 

 well as assistance with Customs services, health, and the important work of the  Stuart in the Gulf. There are four important areas of contribution and what’s  consistent with Labor’s approach all along. We got into this debate saying it  needed to be under the coverage of UN decision making - now there is a new  UN resolution, Labor makes its positive response in the four areas that I’ve  outlined.   

 JOURNALIST:  You don’t think they would be in danger without Australian  troops protecting them?   

 LATHAM:  That is part of the protective forces the UN is mustering and  we, of course, make a contribution with non-combatant personnel - 20 or 30 -  [inaudible] and we will sit down in Government with the UN and sort out the  detail of that so this is a contribution that we would be willing to make as part of 

 an overall UN effort. The great shame, of course, is that Mr Howard has been so  reluctant to support the United Nations involvement in Iraq. He originally  sidelined the UN role in the lead up to the war and we don’t see any  commitment in relation to the peacekeepers. He has consistently said it is not his  cup of tea. Labor’s policy is clear and we will be sticking to that in the future.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  What do you David Kemp’s decision to bow out of politics just  a couple of months out from a federal election?   

 LATHAM:  Well, to take the politics out of it, I think anyone who serves  in the Australian Parliament deserves congratulations, anyone who has put their  shoulder to the wheel in terms of public service. He has a different political party  and philosophy to me but I pay tribute to his work in the Parliament. But the  obvious point of course is that the Government won’t have an effective ongoing  environment spokesperson coming into the election campaign, and I suppose he  is a bit disappointed that the Government hasn’t had a better [inaudible] on  environment issues like Kyoto, mandatory renewable energy targets and the like,  so I think it just confirms the Howard Government has given environmental  protection in Australia a very low priority and now the Minister is retiring at the  next election.   

 JOURNALIST:  On your election policies, will you be submitting those to  Treasury for audit?    

 LATHAM:  We are submitting them to PricewaterhouseCoopers and  they’re doing the checking on the costings of our election commitments and  we’re not waiting for the so-called Charter of Budget Honesty as a process  [inaudible] out from the election. We are on the job now and of course we are  doing so much more than the Howard Government in releasing funding plans  and costings. We have been doing that consistently in the past and of course 

 that process continues - albeit, under a different format with  PricewaterhouseCoopers.   

 JOURNALIST:  Will all policies be audited?   

 LATHAM:  All our policies, come election day, people will know the full  funding and costings [inaudible] that go with them. Until the appointment of  PWC, we were doing that in the release of our material but now we will be doing  that in a different format. Come election time, people will see that Labor is fully  funding and fully costing the policies and we are meeting our budget pledge -  our all important budget pledge - highlighted by keeping the federal budget in  surplus every year of the next parliamentary term.    

 JOURNALIST:  The Government has announced a radical change to its  asylum seeker policy. What is your response to that?   

 LATHAM:  It is good to see the Government adopting Labor policy in  relation to the temporary protection visa holders. Some 9,000 of these visa  holders around Australia have been here for more than a couple of years and in  most cases they’re providing valuable work and community input, particularly in  regional Australia. In January we urged this policy upon the Government at  Labor’s national conference and Mr Howard poo-poohed it at the time, said it  wasn’t possible, had all sorts of criticisms - the [inaudible] of adopting Labor  policy today is a good thing and it goes in a long pattern from parliamentary  superannuation, to baby care payments, to pneumococcal vaccine, to childhood  obesity, to the abolition of ATSIC and other agendas so we are running up a long  list of areas where the Howard Government has been adopting Labor policy, and  the fact that they are doing in relation to temporary protection visas is a very  good thing.   

 JOURNALIST: Would you be hoping for a John Kerry win in the US elections?    

 LATHAM:  I’ll be voting in the Australian election - not only voting; I’ll be  running, and hoping for a Labor win here. I don’t make commentary on the great  American democracy. It is for American citizens to sort that out, just as it for  Australian citizens to either run or vote in our election and I’m working hard for  the election of a Federal Labor Government.    

 JOURNALIST:  David Kemp is [inaudible]     

 LATHAM:  I’m not going to get into those sorts of clichÃ©s. I pay tribute to  the work of any parliamentarian - I mean, public service is important and no  matter which side of politics you come from, if you have a go, and you do  something true to your ideals, well, congratulations for that. But the obvious 

 point is that the Howard Government won’t have an ongoing environment  minister and I think that reflects poorly on their environmental credentials going  into the federal election.   

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Latham, Senator Hill announced this morning another 30  troops would be going to Iraq to instruct Iraqi troops. What is your response to  that?   

 

 LATHAM:   I don’t know the detail of that announcement. What I do  know is that Labor believes the most appropriate commitment, contribution,  Australia can make is through the United Nations, and the four areas I outlined  last night are very important contributions that a Labor Government will make in  the future to the rebuilding and reconstruction of Iraq which has suffered so  much over the years.   

 JOURNALIST:  If we were to be there under the auspices of the UN, do we  need protection?   

 LATHAM:  I answered that question earlier on.   

 [Ends]
