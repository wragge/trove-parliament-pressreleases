 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER  KEVIN RUDD MP   

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY       EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY   

 ADDRESS TO THE 

 AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  8 AUGUST 2007   

 FRESH IDEAS FOR FUTURE CHALLENGES  National Security Policy under a Labor Government   

 

 The first and fundamental responsibility of any Australian government is to  provide for the security and safety of the Australian people, the defence of our  country and the protection of our interests abroad.    

 Maintenance of national security is sacrosanct, whether it is defending the  continent, maintaining stability in our immediate neighbourhood or protecting our  interests in the wider region and beyond.    

 Australia now confronts a more complex threat environment than at any time in  our history.    

 Those that wish us harm are no respecters of borders.    

 We believe Australia must have a national security policy that is capable of  flexibly responding to the multiplicity of challenges we will face in the future.   

 And it follows, therefore, that our defence policy must have defence capabilities  able to meet a wide range of challenges with parallel flexibility.    

 One thing is certain in today’s security policy environment and that is uncertainty  itself.   

 But amidst the uncertainties of our strategic environment, there are certain  fundamental principles that should be restated.    

 â¢ First, we are committed to the forward outlays of this government and  have supported every increase.  We are driven not by savings, but by  value for money. A strong Defence Force requires strong funding.  The  Government is currently spending around $22 billion annually on our  Defence needs.  And we can't afford to waste a cent.  Labor is committed 

 to maintaining defence spending, including a minimum annual 3% real  growth, but Labor is equally committed to ensuring scarce defence dollars  are spent more effectively.   

 â¢ Second, we understand we are a nation that needs friends and allies. Our  alliance with the United States remains central.  We understand our  friends and allies will not always see things as we do.  But they remain  central to our ability to advance our security policy interests.   

 â¢ Third, we need a stable, global, multilateral order because this enhances  our wider security and economic interests.   

 â¢ Fourth, we recognise that our forces must be structured to enable us to  provide for our own defence. But they also need to be structured to  operate further afield in partnership with our friends, allies and, when  appropriate, in support of UN multilateral peacekeeping operations.     

 â¢ Fifth, any rational defence planning for Australia’s future force structure  also needs to be mindful of relative regional capabilities.  In technology,  equipment and personnel we must continue to have the edge.  Without  that, we cannot assure ourselves of our primary obligations.   

 

 Defending our Country   

 On the defence of our own country, Labor holds firm to the principle of defence  self reliance. We believe - Labor has always believed - that the people of  Australia should be willing and able to defend our own country.  Defending  Australia remains the bedrock of Labor defence policy.       

 In the present environment, the threat of attack by any substantial military force is  remote. But we must be able to meet any such contingency.  And to defeat any  such force.    

 Australia’s air - sea approaches therefore remain a central strategic imperative.  However, this is the starting point - not the end point.    

 The Immediate Region   

 But, dominating our immediate strategic geography is not enough. In this new  century, we need to do more than just defend the continent.     

 We need armed forces that can project power into the immediate region when  necessary.    

 The national interest demands we work with our neighbours and friends to foster  a positive security environment in Australia’s neighbourhood.    

 Our immediate neighbourhood is characterised by many fragile and unstable  states, economic under-development and frequent breakdowns in law and order.     

 In pursuit of regional stability and prosperity, Australia must be prepared to  participate in coalitions of allies and friends to secure our regional interests.   

 Beyond the Immediate Region   

 Who would have thought in 1999, in the midst of our humanitarian intervention in  East Timor, that two years later the ADF would also be fighting in Afghanistan? 

 

 Globalisation is changing Australia’s defence reality. Globalisation gives potential  enemies - even small non-state actors - the ability to reach from far beyond our  region to threaten Australia’s interests. 

 

 While there will be a variety of avenues open to us to meet these threats -  including intelligence, counter terrorism, international law enforcement, non  proliferation measures and a more effective middle power diplomacy - the  changing nature of the threat environment requires us to have greater defence  policy dexterity.    

 We therefore need a defence capability that is able to deploy beyond the arc of  instability in partnership with friends and allies, either bilaterally or multilaterally. 

 

 Of course the core constraint in doing all of this is the size of the defence budget,  the size of the ADF and our capacity to deploy our defence assets with dexterity.   

 The US Alliance   

 The alliance with the United States has long been a central pillar in Labor’s  foreign and defence policy.    

 The history of the alliance is a history of bipartisanship. It has survived and  prospered through twelve American presidents and thirteen Australian Prime  Ministers — Democrat and Republican, Labor and Liberal.   It has stood the test of time.    

 Instigated by Labor’s John Curtin and Roosevelt, a Democrat, in the darkest days  of 1941. Consummated by the Liberals’ Menzies and Truman, another Democrat,  in the ANZUS Treaty of 1951.  It is an alliance valued equally by Labor and the  conservatives - despite the periodic, juvenile and increasingly hysterical  protestations of our political opponents.  

 

 The alliance has lasted because our common friendship is real.    

 Our common values are real.   

 And we share significant and continuing common interests.    

 We are of course two very different countries.    

 We have very different national stories.    

 But we are among the oldest democracies in the world, and that counts.   

 For Labor the US alliance sits squarely in the centre of our strategic vision.  Intelligence sharing, access to advanced technologies, systems and equipment,  together with combined military exercises and training enhances Australia’s  national security.    

 The alliance also affords Australia a significant opportunity to influence US  strategic thinking - the question being whether we use that influence wisely and  most particularly within our region.    

 We believe however that Australia’s alliance with the United States is strong  enough - close enough - to withstand disagreements from time to time.    

 Vietnam was one.    

 Iraq is one.    

 And there may be disagreements in the future.   

 But these are the exceptions rather than the rule.   

 Let me state unequivocally that America remains an overwhelming force for good  in the world.    

 Let me state equally unequivocally that America remains an overwhelming force  for strategic stability in the region.    

 These are among the reasons why the US alliance remains fundamental for the  future - but for us, an alliance has never meant automatic compliance, nor will it  ever mean automatic compliance.     

 A New Defence White paper   

 The 2000 Defence White Paper lists as our permanent interests the stability of  our immediate neighbourhood; the security of Southeast Asia; a sustainable  strategic balance among the great powers of Asia; and the maintenance of a  strong global order underpinned by the authority of the UN and the stabilising  power and influence of the US.    

 While much of this remains true, it was seven years ago - which means it was  before 9/11, Bali, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands and the recent  implosions in East Timor.    

 Our strategic circumstances have changed and it is time for a re-evaluation.     

 The current Government appears to have forgotten that a defence doctrine must  be constantly refined to remain coherent and relevant.     

 Coherence, however, has been surrendered by a Government whose approach  has been to meddle not to manage.   

 Defence policy should be more than an annotated list of current military  engagements.    

 Defence policy should be about long-term planning mechanisms.   

 Labor will commission a new Defence White Paper to ensure that our  expenditures produce the force structure we need for the future.    

 A core feature of a new Defence White Paper must be Australia’s rapidly and  radically deteriorating strategic circumstances in the South West Pacific.   

 A further feature of the White Paper must be the long-term trajectory of militant  Islamism.   

 A third feature will be the implications of unrestrained WMD proliferation across  the wider/Asia Pacific region.   

 These represent some of the core challenges to our changing strategic  environment for the next twenty years.   

 Terrorism, Iraq and Afghanistan   

 Australia’s participation in the war in Iraq represents the single greatest failure of  national security policy since Vietnam.   

 Most importantly, Iraq has diverted Australia’s limited military resources from the  military action against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan.   

 The total cost of operations in and around Iraq now stands at around $2 billion.    

 The impact on the ADF and Defence budget priorities has been significant.   

 The ADF, as always, has professionally executed the policy decisions of the  government of the day.    

 You don’t need  me - or any other politician - to tell you that in Iraq and in many  other places around the world the ADF has earned a reputation for being pound  for pound one of the best military forces in the world.    

 Despite the professionalism of the ADF, the prosecution of the Iraq war has failed  all key objectives set for it by the Howard Government.     

 It was intended to eliminate Iraqi WMD.  There were none.    

 It was intended to reduce the terrorist threat. It has increased it.    

 It was supposed to become a harbinger of Middle Eastern democracy.  It has not.    

 It was supposed to liberate an oppressed people.  Now there are 75,000 Iraqi  civilians lying dead and according the British medical journal The Lancet up to  600,000 dead.    

 And, according to the UNHCR, more than 2 million Iraqis have fled to  neighbouring countries - and another 1 million have been internally displaced  through the sectarian violence and civil war that has been unleashed.    

 Having failed to realise any of the four objectives that the government formally  set for this war in the beginning, we then had the recent spectacle of the Defence  Minister inventing - or was it confessing - a new reason for our military  engagement in Iraq.  Oil.  Although that stated reason for the Iraq war lasted for a  considerably shorter period of time than the other stated reasons - less than 24  hours.   

 There is of course one further strategic consequence of this government’s Iraq  war debacle.    And that is the empowerment of Iran.   

 Unfortunately, that does have long-term implications for oil security from the  wider Middle East.    

 After two and a half thousand years it takes genuine strategic policy talent to  succeed in rehabilitating the Persian Empire.    

 Iran is now casting a longer shadow over the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle  East.    

 Iran’s influence in Iraq itself through the Shia majority adds to the overall picture  of strategic destabilisation.   

 And this emboldened Iran (a state which has long supported terrorist  organisations like Hezbollah and Hamas) continues with its nuclear activities.    

 For these reasons, the Iraq debacle hangs around the head of the Howard  Government as a comprehensive failure of national security policy.    

 And the Australian public know it.   

 Should we form the next government of Australia we will inherit this problem.   

 We have already indicated our intention to negotiate a staged withdrawal of  Australian combat forces from Iraq - which we would negotiate with the US and  Iraqi administrations as a matter of priority.    

 We would allow our combat forces to remain in Iraq for the completion of what  would then be their current rotation.  And then provide one further six month  rotation in consultation with the Americans and the Iraqis so that there can be  appropriate time for any necessary adjustments on the ground.    

 We will provide other forms of security, economic and humanitarian assistance to  Iraq as outlined in our previous policy statements.    

 These policies are in line with the Baker-Hamilton report recommendations which  we have long argued represent a credible way forward for us all on Iraq.   

 And we will maintain our continuing commitment to the deployment of Australian  forces in Afghanistan where the military destruction of Osama Bin Laden, Al  Qaeda and the Taliban (those who perpetrated the barbaric attacks on  September 11 against our American ally remains core business).   

 The Asia Pacific Region   

 Within the Asia Pacific region, Australia over the next 20 years faces a great  transformation as a result of the rise of China and the rise of India.    

 China’s nuclear and conventional force modernisation program will present new  challenges for the future.    

 Uncertainties over the Taiwan Straits continue and cool heads will need to prevail  between now and the Beijing Olympics and beyond.  

 

 Despite recent progress with Pyongyang (as a product of highly effective  American diplomacy), the Korean Peninsula remains divided and to this day  remains nuclear.    

 The relationship between India and Pakistan remains brittle - and both are  nuclear weapons states.    

 It should be of concern to Australia’s long-term defence planners that all three of  these unresolved territorial disputes within our wider region involve nuclear  weapons states.   

 In South East Asia the rise of militant Islamism and associated terrorist  organisations remains of deep concern.   

 These concerns are not restricted to the Indonesian archipelago.  Similar  problems have emerged in the Philippines, Southern Thailand and elsewhere.    

 Beyond these long-term security policy drivers across our wider region, our future  national security policy will need to be sufficiently nimble to deal with the full  array of human security challenges as well - people smuggling, money  laundering, drug trafficking as well as communicable diseases such as Avian  Influenza.   

 Our strategic interests in the wider Asia Pacific region should therefore continue  to inform the long-term capability set of the ADF.    

 Arc of Instability   

 And then we come to the Arc of Instability itself from East Timor to our North  across Melanesia including the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Tonga to our East.    

 The trajectory of Australian strategic interests across the arc has deteriorated  sharply over the last decade.    

 Australia is not uniquely responsible for this deterioration.    

 Many other forces have been at work as well.   

 But Australian policy has often compounded rather than ameliorated the drift.    

 As outlined in my recent address to the Lowy Institute, our defence and foreign  policy planners need to be absolutely clear about the long-term costs to Australia  if this deterioration continues.    

 â¢ If more Pacific Island states become failed states, the cost to the  Australian taxpayer of emergency police or military interventions will  become massive. (Remember the projected cost of the intervention in the  Solomon Islands alone is $1 billion dollars and that is for a country with a  population of only half a million);    

 â¢ Second, the cost to the Australian taxpayer of emergency humanitarian  assistance in the event of the collapse in food and medical supplies would  also be massive;   

 â¢ Third, increasing ethnic and political violence (combined with economic  collapse) would produce a wave of refugees to Australia as a country of  first asylum;   

 â¢ Fourth, the explosion of the HIV - AIDS pandemic in PNG presents a  growing risk to the public health of Australian communities in the Torres  Strait and Northern Australia; and    

 â¢ Fifth, the fragile nature of Australia’s diplomatic relationships with many  Pacific Island countries is creating an unprecedented strategic opportunity  for other non-regional states to occupy the vacuum and to further displace  Australian interests.    

 In the period ahead, I am particularly concerned about political and security  scenarios for East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Fiji.     

 Fiji is of major concern given unresolved political tensions, the disposition of the  police and the armed forces, and the relative density of the urban population.    

 That is a core reason why I have already indicated Labor’s proposal for a Pacific  Partnership for Development and Security - to be funded long-term through our  commitment to raise our global ODA from 0.35% of GNI in 2010/2011 to 0.5% by  2015/2016.    

 This is a large, long-term commitment, but one designed to rebuild the economic  and social infrastructure of Melanesia in particular - because unless we do so,  we will be permanently plagued by the need to engage in one-off security  interventions.    

 Nonetheless, we must be equally prepared to engage in such interventions in the  future.    

 For these reasons, the future ADF will also need a force structure capable of  anticipating and responding to multiple and possibly simultaneous security  contingencies - both man-made and natural.    

 If this country finds itself incapable of acting independently (or in partnership with  our close friend and ally New Zealand whose efforts in the South Pacific in  partnership with ourselves often goes unreported) then there is a long-term  danger that the Island states will increasingly turn elsewhere.     

 And that is not in Australia’s long-term strategic interests - especially given the  importance of our maritime approaches.   

 An Overstretched ADF    

 The ADF has been badly stretched by the demands that have been made on  them by this Government, without adequate thought about how the services, and  Army especially, can be adapted to the new and very demanding requirements of  expeditionary stabilisation operations.    

 While they are not at the point of snapping, the geographical scope, the tempo  and scale of their current commitments have put the ADF under increased  operational pressure. ASPI’s own Mark Thompson, notes that this is  compounded by pre-existing problems of personnel shortages and equipment  deficiencies.   

 Under this government, capability development decisions have been  characterised by a lack of coherence, an absence of definitive priorities in ADF  strategic guidance and political interference in the capability acquisition process.   

 The Shadow Defence Minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, estimates that at least $13 billion  worth of recent and current projects have either gone over budget, have been  funded but not developed, or now hang in limbo.    

 This has put at risk  the development of capabilities such as cyber warfare,  information operations and the ongoing development of network centric warfare.    

 The problems in our defence capability planning are expressed vividly - and  deplorably - in several  defence procurements which have experienced cost  overruns, unreasonable delays, and most alarmingly, performance shortfalls.    

 Take the Seasprite helicopters.  These were ordered in 1997 and scheduled for  delivery in 2000, for around $667 million. More than $1 billion dollars later,  Australia's 11 Seasprite helicopters - with airframes that were in service during  the Vietnam War - are still not fully operational and the entire project may now be  scrapped.  If they are scrapped, an extra $1.5 billion will be required to augment  the Anzac Frigate’s capability.   

 It never easy to find this kind of money and it will be so much harder now that the  Government has made its impromptu $6 billion Super Hornet decision.   

 The Guided Missile Frigate (FFG) upgrade is a second case in point.    

 The upgrade of these frigates and the integration of their new command and  control systems have now been delayed for more than 40 months. The Navy still  does not have an operational, upgraded FFG and the target date has been  tentatively set at 2008.   

 And then there is the significant project delivery problems with the 22 Tiger  Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters (ARH).    

 The sheer scale of the problems in Mr Howard's defence budget is staggering.     

 Last budget, ASPI estimated capital slippage of $1.1 billion over the forward  estimates. The practical effect is that the government has not delivered to our  troops the capabilities promised to them in previous budgets.   

 The Defence Material Organisation has admitted that 58 out of 204 current  projects are late. That’s about 30%. Of the delayed projects 28 are over 6  months late.    

 Over the last 6 years, $13 billion worth of projects have either been late, suffered  cost blowouts or have been scrapped.     

 In summary, almost one quarter of the annual Defence procurement budget is  not performing.   

 In short, the government has thrown an impressive amount of money at  Australia’s armed forces but an extraordinary amount of it has failed to reach the  target. In Defence, as in any other form of expenditure, a dollar can only be spent  once.    

 The more serious risk is that in all the waste and mismanagement and ad hoc  decision making,  the government is foregoing the opportunity to build a balanced  force structure on which the ADF and the Australian public can depend into the  future.    

 Efficiency in Defence is not just a matter of fiscal rectitude.  It’s a strategic  necessity.  Australia can only support the kinds of forces we will need over  coming decades if we spend every dollar as wisely as possible.  It is strategically  reckless to do otherwise.   

 As this year’s ASPI budget brief points out:    

 The current piecemeal cycle of investment followed by bids for additional  personnel and operating costs is no substitute for coherent long-term  planning. Not only does it fail to provide incentives for defence to deliver 

 capability efficiently, but it robs the electorate of the ability to judge the  opportunity cost of decisions.   

 For too long, the Howard Government has let Defence drift.    

 The people who are let down by these failures are not governments and  politicians, they are the people of Australia - first as taxpayers who deserve to  have their dollars spent well and wisely, and secondly as citizens in whose  interests the defence of the country is undertaken.   

 Upon assuming Government, Labor will conduct a comprehensive independent  national audit of the Defence budget to determine the true position of that budget  - in particular the capital budget.  In response to that audit we will do what is  necessary and spend what is necessary to develop a strong, flexible and well  equipped Australian Defence Force -  to serve Australian interests over the next  quarter century.     

 The foundation of good defence policy is careful alignment of strategic  objectives, capability priorities and funding commitments, and stringent  management.     

 Force Structure and Capability Planning   

 The foundation of good defence policy is careful alignment of strategic  objectives, capability priorities and funding commitments, and stringent  management.     

 Our army is too small to meet our future security policy requirements.     

 We would struggle if one or more countries in the arc of instability were to require  a substantial military commitment.    

 In short, as we currently stand we need additional infantry battalions something  now recognised by the Government.   

 We also need to upgrade the army’s cultural and linguistic capabilities as they  relate to the South West Pacific. Communication is critical to effectiveness.    

 At the same time, we need to keep building our air and naval forces. These are  critical  to  defending  ourselves  against  conventional  threats,  and  maximising   Australia’s capacity to participate in coalition operations within the wider region.    

 We also need to attach priority to the development of our intelligence assets and  our special forces.  Given the terrorist threat to Australian citizens at home and  abroad,  these  will  become  increasingly  critical  capabilities  for  Australia  for  the  

 future.  And given the intensity of the training involved in these highly specialised  disciplines, we also need to be mindful of retention policies.     

 A  feature  of  the  Australian  Defence  Force's  extraordinary  operational   performance has been the highly cohesive nature of the joint operations between  the  three  services.  Joint  capabilities  are  the  bedrock  on  which  modern  military   operations are founded, and an area in which the ADF has excelled.   

 Office of National Security   

 Terrorism and the multifaceted nature of the security threats we will face in the  future require a more integrated policy machinery than we have had hitherto in  Australia.    

 The lack of national security policy coordination at present maximises the chance  that intelligence, national security policy advice, and integrated national security  policy development will be flawed.   

 For example, how can we best develop an integrated security policy response to  the challenge of terrorism in Islamic South East Asia, which if it is to be effective,  must involve military capabilities, police capabilities, diplomatic capabilities,  integrated development assistance programs as well as linguistic, cross-cultural  and interfaith capabilities?   

 Furthermore, how effectively are we currently coordinating our national response  capabilities to terrorist incidents involving Australian citizens both within Australia  and abroad?  Is there appropriate national leadership of our various national  counter disaster capabilities to deal with large scale casualties? Or damage to 

 critical economic or communications infrastructure?   

 Do we have an integrated strategy to prevent the spread of international  communicable diseases - or to deal with critical outbreaks if they occur?   

 In short, the part must relate to the whole if we are to coherently respond to the  breadth, depth and density of the emerging security policy environment for  Australia in the 21st Century.    

 If elected to office, Labor will establish an Office of National Security.    The Office will be under the Prime Minister’s portfolio and will be headed by a  National Security Advisor.   

 Following a Labor Defence White Paper, we will write a more comprehensive  National Security Statement that clearly articulates the strategic rationale and  capability requirements for all our security, intelligence and related agencies.    

 Conclusion 

 

 Within the framework of our overall national security and defence policy, the  Australian Defence Force - which gives effect to that policy - must remain the  core.    

 And the core of the ADF are our men and women in uniform.  No matter how  smart and capable our policy making, without the skill, courage and sacrifice of  military personnel we cannot defend Australia.   

 The retention of our defence personnel is a critical challenge for whichever party  forms the next government of Australia.  The current government’s performance  on recruitment and retention has been poor.  As the alternative government of  Australia we must do better.  I will have more to say on this matter in the months  ahead.    

 The men and women of the ADF make Australians proud. That’s why we must  give them what they need to do their jobs and ease the difficult circumstances  their families often must endure.    

 Our vision for Australia is for a strong Australia.    

 Our vision for Australia is for a competitive Australia.   

 Our vision for Australia is a secure Australia.   

 And the men and women of the ADF are central to that vision.
