 ARMS SYSTEM A FINALIST FOR INTERNATIONAL AWARD

 ARMS - the Adult Migrant English Program Reporting and Management System - is one of  five finalists in the Education and Academia section of the prestigious 1996 Computerworld  Smithsonian Awards.

 Announcing the achievement, thie Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr  Philip Ruddock, said the awards were for Innovative technology that makes the world a  more humane, healthy and cooperative place to live in.

 "The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) provides newly-arrived migrants and  refugees with basic English language tuition to help them settle successfully in Australia  and meet their goals in terms of employment, education and social interaction," Mr  Ruddock said.

 "The ARMS system was developed cooperatively by the Department, Anderson Consulting  and the education professionals who provide AMEP services In all States and Territories. It was socially designed to give tire AMEP the flexibility It needs to achieve its objectives.

 "ARMS streamlines client access to the AMEP, identifies special language needs for  groups such as women, youth, tire aged and refugees, monitors outcomes and allows  service providers to plan programs to meet' clients' needs in terms of location and  curriculum".
