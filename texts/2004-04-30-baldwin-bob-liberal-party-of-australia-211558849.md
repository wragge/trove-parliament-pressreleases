 BALDWIN WELCOMES DR SHARRAD TO MEDOWIE   

 Federal Member for Paterson Bob Baldwin MP today warmly welcomed news of a new GP  entering practice in Medowie.   

 Dr Falah Sharrad is a fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.    

 Mr Baldwin said after the departure of three doctors from the Port Stephens Medical Centre in  March this year, Medowie had been short of one full-time doctor.   

 “I know that the partners of the practice were concerned they would not be able to keep these rooms  open,” Mr Baldwin said.   

 “But to their credit and the benefit of the Medowie community they found a highly trained, young  doctor who is very keen to start his own general practice and raise his family in the local area.  As  of Thursday, Dr Sharrad will be practising in Medowie.   

 “I have been working hard to ensure Dr Sharrad obtained a provider number quickly and without  any delays and it is good news for Medowie that he has this provider number this week,” Mr  Baldwin said.   

 “In this process, it has become clear to me that areas like Medowie are being unfairly disadvantaged  by the current RRMA classifications and I will be fighting to have this 10-year-old system changed  to ensure the benefits of the Medicare Plus package flow through to our fast growing outer regional  communities.   

 “I have invited Health Minister Tony Abbott to the area to see for himself why the RRMA system  needs an overhaul.”    

 The rooms formerly known as Port Stephens Medical Practice will be called Medowie Medical  Centre located at 11-12 Ferodale Road, Medowie.   

 Dr Sharrad received a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery from Bagdad University in Iraq, and has  since been recognised by the AMA and RACGP in Australia. Dr Sharrad came to Australia as a  refugee from Iraq in 1999, and since then has met and married Kate, a nurse practitioner who will  work in the surgery with him.  They have one child.     

 “Medowie now has an experienced knowledgeable doctor who has an interest in continuing his  studies into medicine to ensure his patients get the best care possible.  I know that Dr Sharrad and  his young family are keen to call Medowie home for the long term.”
