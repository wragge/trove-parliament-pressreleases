 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Simon and I have just, as you’ve seen, had a tour of Cobham’s here in Adelaide.  This is a great example of Australian technology, expertise being brought together to  provide world’s best systems for monitoring and helping to defend Australia’s  borders. This company is doing great work and it’s a great example of Australian  ingenuity and technology here, based right here in South Australia.  

 Now the issue of border protection becomes more important all the time. Since the  Rudd Government changed the border protection rules in August last year, we’ve  had 15 boats arrive and well over 500 illegal arrivals. That is more than twice the  number that had arrived in the previous six years. This has been a massive increase  in arrivals. People smuggling is a terrible business. It is a pernicious trade. It  endangers human life. It endangers the integrity of our borders. It’s run by criminals  who very often are also involved in drug trafficking and worse. The policy of the  Australian Government should be no boats. That’s my policy - no boats. Everything  we do should be aimed at zero boat arrivals.  

 Now we’ve had this dramatic increase and the Government says that it’s got nothing  to do with the change in policy. Well that’s not the view of the International  Organization for Migration. It’s certainly not the view of the Indonesian Ambassador  and it’s not the view of the would-be passengers, customers of the people smugglers  who were recently interviewed in Indonesia. We’ve also seen reports, which haven’t  been denied by the Government, that the Australian Federal Police advised that the  change in policies would result in an increase in people smuggling.  

 Now there is a vital issue of national importance here that needs to be thoroughly  investigated. So we’re calling on the Government to establish an independent inquiry  headed up by somebody expert in this area, completely independent, to look at all  the advice that’s been received by the Government, to look at the policies that are in  place now, to ask what impact they have had on people smuggling and what policies  would be more effective, because we should all be completely in agreement that the  object of Australia’s border protection policies should be no people smuggling. No  people smuggling. That’s my policy - no people smuggling. Mr Rudd’s policy is not  working because the boats are arriving in ever increasing numbers - we’re only just  at the beginning of the dry, so there’s likely to be a lot more boats in the weeks and 

 months ahead. So we need an inquiry to go into this. The Australian people are  entitled to know what advice the Government has received, what advice it has  ignored, if it has ignored it, and what the impact of this change in policy has been.  

 QUESTION:  

 What else can be done to fix it? Your policy is not boats but what things can you  actually do?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well we had a range of policies when we were in government and they ranged from  turning boats back to Indonesia, they ranged from surveillance, extensive  surveillance and of course Cobham is undertaking a contract that was established by  the previous government. They’re discharging it very well. We had different visas for  people who arrived by boat. There was a whole range of policies and it was a  package. But it appeared to work because there were hardly any boat arrivals during  the time that that policy was in place.  

 Now the Rudd Government has made some significant changes and there’s been a  massive increase in arrivals. So clearly their policy is not working. I’ve offered to sit  down with the Prime Minister and discuss it in an attempt to find a set of policies that  we could agree on from both sides of politics. He doesn’t want to do that, so let’s  have an independent person to look into the situation so that we can know, as  Australians, what the Government was told, what advice it’s ignored, if it has ignored  it, and what the impact of these policies actually is.  

 QUESTION:  

 Who are you suggesting that independent person could be?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I don’t want to identify any names because that would make sure they wouldn’t  be selected I suppose. But it should be somebody who is experienced in this area,  experienced in administration, experienced in border protection issues ideally.  Somebody who is an expert. I’m sure there are quite a few people who would fit that  bill and someone whose integrity and expertise would be beyond question and that’s  who the Government should appoint - someone that can have a thoroughly  independent inquiry.  

 QUESTION:  

 What are your thoughts on what Swan said about that we’re having a rapid recovery  with the economy?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well we would all hope to have a rapid recovery from the downturn that we’re facing  at the moment. But the way to ensure that we have a rapid recovery or an effective  recovery is to have policies that are focused on a recovery - policies like those I’ve  been proposing that are focused on small business. You see, small business is in  the frontline of the economy. We’ve just been at a jobs forum in Hindmarsh, talking 

 with small businesses about the recovery, about jobs. What can governments do to  ensure that it’s easier for small businesses to stay in business and keep people on  the payroll? Jobs, jobs, jobs - that is the focus. That’s what our plans are for. We  have a plan for recovery. At the moment, the only thing the Rudd Government is  doing is borrowing a lot of money, ensuring higher taxes and higher interest rates in  the future and spending that money with no effect on jobs. It hasn’t created a job.  

 QUESTION:  

 Do you agree with Swan’s estimation that things should start to turn upwards by late  next year though?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well that’s his forecast. We’ll see what the future holds. There are a lot of events that  have occurred that weren’t forecast a few years ago. So he’s entitled to have his  forecast but if you want to make sure a recovery occurs, you’ve got to have policies  that support a recovery. Just think about this: right now the Government is running  up larger and larger debts. Those heavy debts will slow a recovery, because the  higher the level of government debt, the higher the level of tax and the higher  interest rates will be in the future.  

 QUESTION:  

 What’s your response then to the Access Economics prediction that one million  people will be unemployed at the peak of this recession?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I’ve seen the forecast from Access Economics. It simply underlines the  importance of having a plan for recovery. We have a plan for recovery. We have a  six-point plan for small business which will put more cash into the hands of small  businesses, reduce the on-costs of employing people, cut through regulation,  unnecessary regulation and red tape. Every focus of our policy is on jobs, on  ensuring that we have an effective recovery. At the moment the growing levels of  debt and the ineffective spending of the Rudd Government is going to slow a  recovery. So we are promoting effective recovery. To date we have not seen from  the Rudd Government a plan for recovery. We’ve seen policies that will promote or  deliver higher taxes and higher interest rates.  

 QUESTION:  

 Also in the Access Economics report there’s raised issues of water supplies in  Australia and the fact that the Federal Government still seems to be dragging the  chain in finding a solution to the River Murray in the future. Do you think that should  be on the agenda for COAG again on Thursday?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, water should always be on the agenda. It’s the single biggest environmental  challenge that we face in Australia, water scarcity. What’s why it was my key focus  when I was water minister. That’s why we had a national plan for water security, why 

 we allocated $10 billion to ensure that we could restore the health of the Murray  River, ensure that we could produce more food with less water. And what we’ve  seen with the Rudd Government is that they’ve dropped the ball on that great  initiative. We put the Federal Government for the first time in our history in a position  where it was in charge of water planning in the Murray-Darling Basin. What has the  Rudd Government done with that power? Nothing.  

 QUESTION:  

 Budget’s not far away. What sort of cuts would you make in the Budget to make it  viable?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, if it was our budget we wouldn’t have spent so much money on cash splashes  and so we’d have a lot more money to spend on worthwhile objectives. This is the  tragedy of this Government. They’re Jekyll and Hyde. On the one hand, they’re  borrowing $23 billion and handing it out like Santa Claus. On the other hand, they’ve  going around trying to cut back on medical services, cut back on the Medicare Safety  Net, cut back on superannuation, cut back on payments to pensioners. What are  they about? Are they spending or are they saving? The Government cannot credibly  go out to Australians and say this is time to tighten your belt, because they’ve just  literally in the last week handed out nearly $14 billion in $900 payments. I mean, this  is a Government that seems to be completely confused about what its economic  strategy is. They are literally Jekyll and Hyde. They don’t know what they’re trying to  do - saving or spending.  

 QUESTION:  

 What’s your reaction to the news on Holden? Were you surprised at the extent of the  job losses and do you think that the Federal Government should be doing more to  protect the automotive industry in Australia?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I’m very pleased that Holden here in Australia has said that the announcements in  the United States won’t result in any job losses in Australia. That is our concern. Our  key concern is for the jobs of the workers and their families here in Australia. The  challenges that General Motors faces in the United States are well known and well  understood. But every attention should be given by the Government to ensuring that  there are no job losses following from Holden here in Australia. It’s a very tough  market both locally and globally - we understand that - but at this stage we’re  pleased to see Holden’s statement.  

 QUESTION:  

 This is a pretty esoteric question but you can blame Chris Uhlmann.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Give Chris my regards.  

 QUESTION:  

 I shall do. The framing of the Budget contains different wording round about the  issue of forecasting and I think it was canvassed on AM today. Do you have any  remarks on the way that this Government is using its budget forecasting by adding  another year?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, look, you don’t have to be very cynical or even sceptical to be concerned that  when governments change the way in which they’re expressing their forecasts or  expressing their financial results that they’re changing the format in order to make  the final result look better. The Budget will be judged on its results, just like the cash  splashes have been judged on their results. Why do people think the cash splashes  were ineffective? Because Mr Rudd said it would create 75,000 jobs and  unemployment keeps on going up. It hasn’t created one job. The test of this Budget  is going to be how much debt, how much debt is Mr Rudd and Mr Swan going to put  on the shoulders of our generation, the next generation and the generation after that.  Think about this - it took John Howard ten years, ten years to pay off $96 billion of  Labor debt. How long is it going to take us to pay off 200, $300 billion of Kevin  Rudd’s Labor debt? That is the challenge for the Budget. What is it going to do for  jobs and how much debt is it going to put on the shoulders of Australians and what  will we have to show for it?  

 Thanks very much.
