 Media Release  The Hon Greg Hunt MP   Shadow Minister for Climate Action, Environment and Heritage  2 August 2011 $4 Million in Misleading Junk Mail on Labor’s Carbon Tax Taxpayers are rightly outraged that $4 million of their money is being spent on Labor’s misleading Carbon Tax junk mail which has hit letterboxes across the country today. My office has been inundated with calls and emails from people, disgusted by the waste from  the Labor Government in sending out the 20 page booklet. It is a misleading piece of junk mail which should go straight into people’s recycling bins. There’s no mention that the NSW Treasury believes that electricity prices are likely to jump 20 per cent, not the 10 per cent which Julia Gillard claims in her booklet. The booklet also fails to explain how the Carbon Tax will slug 60,000 businesses due to changes to diesel fuel from 2014. The only way that the Government can claim to be reducing emissions is by purchasing carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. The Gillard Labor Government is forecasting Australians  will spend $3.5 billion in 2020 to buy 100 million tonnes of foreign carbon credits, rising to $57 billion in 2010 dollars by 2050. In short, the tax won’t decrease actual Australian emissions but it will create a permanent black hole in our budget. The booklet also omits references to the higher marginal tax rates for low and middle income earners. Every day there’s another example of how the Carbon Tax will increase the cost of living for families.  Prices will just go up and up. Australians didn’t vote for this Carbon Tax, they didn’t vote for this junk mail and it’s time Julia Gillard stopped this misleading and political advertising campaign.
