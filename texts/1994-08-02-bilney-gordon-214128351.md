 Gordon Bilney MP

 Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, today announced the Government  would fund three emergency relief projects in Rwanda - totalling $1.7 million - through the  Australian Red Cross, Community Aid Abroad and the World Food Programme.

 The Minister said funding for the proposals would be allocated from the Government's $6.5  million emergency relief package for Rwanda announced by the Prime Minister last week.

 "The projects address the highest priority needs in Rwanda," M r Bilney said. "Clean water,  sanitation and basic food supplies are still urgently needed as thousands continue to die in  camps with appalling sanitary conditions."

 "However the international relief effort is starting to have some effect on the plight o f the  refugees as agencies distribute increasing volumes o f supplies and equipment."

 C om m unity Aid A broad will receive $435,000 for water supply activities in the Benaco  camps and nearby areas in Tanzania. Under the program the lake, which is supplying the  current system and likely to run dry within weeks, will be replaced by groundwater. Funds will  be used to install boreholes, construct water truck loading platforms, water treatment systems, 

 storage tanks, and pumping equipment.

 The program will be implemented by OXFAM International, Community Aid Abroad's partner  agency in the field. It will also train local personnel in technical and managerial aspects o f the  program and includes counselling and education for traumatised children in the camps.

 T he A ustralian R ed Cross will receive $300,000 for the placement o f Australian personnel -  such as medical specialists and sanitation engineers - in international Red Cross operations in  Rwanda and at Goma in Zaire.
