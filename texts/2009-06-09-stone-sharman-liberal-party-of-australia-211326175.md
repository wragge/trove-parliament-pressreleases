 Soft policy requires more than diplomatic response 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 “In a further admission that the Government’s soft migration and people smuggling  policies have failed, Mr Rudd has appointed a full time People Smuggling  Ambassador,” Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Dr Sharman Stone  said today.  

 “Whilst the details of the new Ambassador, Mr Peter Woolcott’s role are unclear, the  Coalition has a strong expectation that he will have more than mere diplomacy at his  disposal.  

 “The Coalition has called for a full review of the impact of the Rudd Government’s  softening of policy on the boat arrivals.  

 “We have called for a full inquiry into the impact of the soft policy on boat arrivals and  we have called for the urgent release of the outcome of the Northern Territory’s  Coronial Inquiry into SIEV36.  

 “It is imperative that both these things happened if the new Ambassador for People  Smuggling is to have any chance of making a difference.  

 “In the end it is no good having a diplomatic focus on relationship building if the  policies remain soft.  

 “Diplomacy is no substitute for strong strategies; rather, diplomacy must be part of a  strong and well-resourced regional approach to the issue,” Dr Stone said.
