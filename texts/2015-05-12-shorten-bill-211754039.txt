 THE HON BILL SHORTEN MP  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  MEMBER FOR MARIBYRNONG   

 SPEECH   

 CONDOLENCE MOTION FOR the Honourable Michael MacKellar AM   

 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  TUESDAY, 12 MAY 2015   

 *** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY *** 

 On behalf of the Labor party, I pay my respects to the Honourable Michael  MacKellar AM. 

 

 Michael lived a life dedicated to his family, his party and his country. 

 

 He came to the Federal Parliament in 1969, an agricultural scientist turned  politician who regained the seat of Warringah for his party from the maverick  former Liberal, Edward St John. 

 

 It was as Immigration Minister that Michael saw perhaps his best triumphs in the  Parliament. He oversaw Australia’s first comprehensive policy for the  resettlement of refugees, subsequently superintended by the Honourable Ian  Macphee and John Menadue.  

 

 In 1977 Michael Mackellar said: 

 

 “I believe that there would be few in this House who would not support a  commitment for Australia to play the most effective role possible in refugee  settlement…there is a community willingness to assist the dispossessed and 

 displaced from overseas in a sensible and realistic way to seek sanctuary and a  new life in Australia.” 

 

 It was under Michael’s stewardship that the first Vietnamese refugees found a  new home here. 

 

 Their place in our nation’s story, their part in our thriving modern, multicultural  Australia will stand forever as a tribute to Michael MacKellar’s moderation,  compassion and decency. 

 

 We salute the service he gave to our nation and we extend our sympathies to his  partner, Pamela, children Cameron, Duncan and Maggie, and his grandchildren. 

 

 ENDS
