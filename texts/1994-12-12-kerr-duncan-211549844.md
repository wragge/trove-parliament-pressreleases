 Opening Address

 Second Regional Conference on  International Humanitarian Law

 by the Hon Duncan Kerr, MR  Australian Minister for Justice

 Australian Defence Studies Centre Canberra

 12 December 1994

 Second Regional Conference on International Humanitarian Law Canberra, 12 December 1994 1

 Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the Second Regional Conference on International Humanitarian Law. It’s been  11 years since the first such conference and as we all know, the world has changed much  since then. Unfortunately, in the context of respect for International Humanitarian Law, not 

 necessarily for the better.

 I would like to congratulate the Australian Red Cross and the Australian Defence Studies  Centre for hosting this important event. Important for a number of reasons, not least because  it brings together so many committed individuals from Australia and overseas to discuss the  fundamentally difficult issue of human rights in a war zone.

 I extend a warm welcome to all delegates. Your presence at this conference provides a  unique opportunity for governments not only to examine issues relevant to international  humanitarian law, but also to set the scene for increasing government and community focus  on this area of law as we approach the next century.

 Australia has not suffered the widespread ravages of war, because our geographic isolation  has provided us with a natural fortress in the past However, we do not see ourselves as  isolated from understanding that some of our neighbours in the south east Asian region have  not been so fortunate. On behalf of the Federal Government I would like to thank member 

 countries from the region for demonstrating their commitment to international humanitarian  law by sending representatives to this Conference.

 We are here together for the next few days to refocus attention on, and respect for, the  principles of international humanitarian law. To begin, I think it is useful to remind ourselves  of its background.

 International humanitarian law began to develop and be recognised as customary international  law last century. It was codified this century, principally in the Geneva Conventions of 1949  and the Additional Protocols of 1977.

 Australia has ratified these instruments, and implemented them through domestic legislation  (the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 as amended) which provides for life imprisonment for the  wilful killing of a protected person, and 14 years imprisonment for grave breaches of  international humanitarian law. Dissemination of information about those obligations has  been taken seriously as demonstrated by the Chief of the Defence Force’s decision to extend 

 training in the Law of Armed Conflict to all Australian service personnel.

 This body of law intends to impose limits on the use of violence even in times of armed  conflict by insisting on certain basic humanitarian principles which:

 Second Regional Conference on International Humanitarian Law Canberra, 12 December 1994 2

 â¢ protects those not directly engaged in hostilities (civilians, prisoners of war, etc);

 â¢ allows the sick and wounded to be collected and cared for;

 â¢ prohibits weapons or methods of warfare that cause unnecessary losses or excessive  suffering; and,

 â¢ contains the effects of violence in the attainment of the military objectives of the  conflict.

 The unique aspect of international humanitarian law is that it applies without judgment of the  merits of the causes being fought over. These agreed humanitarian principles must be  observed when parties can only settle their differences by military, rather than peaceful  means. Because both sides are bound to follow them, neither ought be disadvantaged.

 The nature of war has changed alarmingly this century, first from national conflicts resolved  by traditional battles to international “great” wars, and now to sharp localised internal  conflicts caused by deeply felt nationalist, ethnic, religious and political opinions flaring into  open conflict in this post-Cold War era.

 The 1994 United Nations Human Development Report shows that in conflicts at the start of  the twentieth century 90% of war casualties were military, whilst now at the end of the  century, 90% are civilian casualties.

 These stark facts provide a sense of urgency to the effort to give full effect to international  humanitarian law and seek ways of improving it.

 Lawlessness often accompanies the collapse of governments and military regimes, making  negotiations with local authorities nearly impossible. Unfortunately, this has been  accompanied by a decreasing respect for international humanitarian law and subsequently a  lessening of the effectiveness of laws designed to bring a modicum of decency and dignity to 

 the ravages of war.

 In other words, although the need for international humanitarian law to operate effectively has  intensified greatly, its practice appears to have weakened.

 By convening the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims in August 1993  at the initiative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Swiss Government  provided the impetus for our conference.

 160 states sent delegates to that Conference, including Australia. Its Final Declaration called  on the Swiss Government to convene an Inter-Governmental Group of Experts to prepare a

 submission for the Protection of War Victims Conference which will convene in Geneva in  January 1995.

 The Group of Experts will submit a report as the basis for discussions at the 1995  International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Its report has the  potential to eventually influence formal treaty making bodies.

 I recognise that our conference this week is relatively short. However, I am confident that it  might provide the impetus for establishing part-time Regional Working Groups consisting of  both government and non-government representatives.

 As with any conference, some of the most useful outcomes will be achieved by networking  out of session.

 Various government, military and cultural leaders in this region also have an interest in  international humanitarian law. And it is important to acknowledge the valuable contribution  such delegates can make along with human rights academics, Red Cross and other civilian  experts.

 We have to recognise the potential long term effects of this Conference’s outcome and take  advantage of them. They can extend beyond our immediate goals for 1995 and promote  international humanitarian law internationally.

 This Conference then provides us with an historic opportunity.

 No nation is immune from the tragedy of war. In my address today I will focus on one  particularly pernicious instrument of war, diabolically perfected by sophisticated weapons  technology -  anti-personnel mines.

 This is both a major international and regional concern as the experience of Cambodia has  shown.

 I would like to focus on anti-personnel mines as an area where I believe international  humanitarian law could, and should, be used to develop an effective internationally-  coordinated response. I note the widespread and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel mines  was a major theme of the Final Declaration of the Protection of War Victims Conference.

 Forty two States, including, I am proud to say, Australia, are parties to the 1980 Convention  on Certain Conventional Weapons which may be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious (often  known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention). The Land Mines Protocol of this Convention  imposes limited restrictions on the use of land mines in international conflicts. Unfortunately,

 the Convention and Protocol do not apply to internal conflicts which can be just as  destructive, which, as I stated earlier, are now more common.

 Also absent from the Convention are verification mechanisms, complaints procedures, and  mechanisms for allocating resources and responsibility for de-mining operations. I am sure  that every delegate here today shares my hope that all these problems will be addressed at the  September 1995 Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.

 The Group of Experts convened to make recommendations in respect of the review of this  Convention and Protocol held their third session in Geneva this August.

 I urge all countries which have not yet become parties to the Convention and Protocol to  ratify them and participate in the Review Conference.

 A total ban on anti-personnel mines is understandably appealing because of the disparate and  horrific impact on civilians (especially children) and developing economies. Recently the  Australian Government was presented with a petition circulated by over 50 Australian  humanitarian aid agencies calling on the Government to support a world-wide total ban on 

 land mines.

 The Australian Government accepts that landmines can have military objectives and use as a  conventional weapon, but is seriously concerned with their human toll.

 Realistically, limitations are more achievable and more likely to be complied with than a total  ban. Australia is proposing strengthened rules on marking and recording, a ban on non-  detectable mines and a ban on anti-personnel mines that are not self-destructing or self-  neutralising.

 These changes should prevent the indiscriminate delayed assault of mines on civilians. We  also support the incorporation of production and trade restrictions to help enforce compliance  with the provisions on use of mines. Thus we support a ban on exports of mines to countries  that are not parties to the Protocol, and a ban on exports of non-self-destructing mines.

 Just what are we up against when we confront the issue of anti-personnel or landmines?

 The five countries most affected by landmines are Afghanistan, Angola , Iraq, Kuwait and  Cambodia. In total an estimated 40 million people inhabit these five nations. Of these 40  million only a small percentage would belong to the military - the majority are of course  civilians.

 The contribution of countries with first-hand experience of mines, such as Ethiopia, to the meeting of the Group of Experts to review inhumane weapons, has made a significant and

 practical contribution to the debate. This is especially so when you consider that the Group is  self-funding and therefore less represented by developing countries. I am confident that the  contribution of countries with such experience at our Conference will likewise be significant.

 As many of you would be aware, some mines are designed to cause maximum physical  damage without necessarily causing death. For the victim whose body is riddled with dirt and  debris, extensive amputations are often necessary. Without such amputations infection sets in  and more operations required, especially where the medical procedure is not sophisticated  enough to enable prostheses to be fitted (a luxury in many countries, particularly with 

 children who quickly outgrow them).

 Other mines are distributed from aircraft (remote delivery) and have an aerodynamic design  similar to a butterfly. This can look like an irresistible toy to children, who are particularly  vulnerable because their small bodies are closer to the centre of the blast. Children are  highly unlikely to survive massive blood loss.

 Plastic rather than metal devices are particularly dangerous. The shrapnel they disperse in  human tissue is impossible to detect by X-Ray. They are also notoriously difficult to de­ mine, because this involves the use of metal detector prods.

 As well as the physical injuries they inflict, landmines can have a devastating effect on the  economies of developing nations. Unexploded mines can be active for up to 50 years,  rendering unusable large tracts of land. The existence of landmines further destroys  communities by deterring war refugees from returning to their homelands.

 Australia and other countries in our region have made substantial contributions to mine  clearance. The Australian Government recently contributed $2 million towards the  Cambodian Mine Action Centre, in addition to $1.34 million from the Defence Cooperation  Fund for the demining activities of 8 Australian Defence Force personnel.

 We should pause to remember that for every 5000 mines cleared, it has been estimated that  one expert is killed and two are injured.

 The Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Human Rights in Cambodia, Australian  Justice Michael Kirby, has said that his Report provides a graphic illustration of the urgent  need to respond. He said:

 “No study of human rights in Cambodia can ignore the deadly peril of land mines...

 They take a daily toll on the right to life and the right to movement. But more  fundamentally, they destabilise Cambodian society, which has, with Angola, the  distinction of the highest level of war-caused amputees in the world’’.

 Second Regional Conference on International Humanitarian Law Canberra, 12 December 1994 6

 A medical expert put it even more bluntly, that Cambodia is being de-mined “an arm and a  leg at a time”.

 The human cost of land mines is appallingly high.

 Of course, the toll exacted by anti-personnel mines is but one aspect of war that international  humanitarian law can address. The fact that I have chosen to concentrate on this topic in no  way diminishes the importance of addressing other issues raised by the Protection of War  Victims Conference such as:

 â¢ protecting women and children in armed conflict zones

 â¢ caring for refugees

 â¢ peacekeeping

 â¢ providing emergency relief and civil defence.

 In the time available today I can do no more than flag these issues. However, I would like in  passing to mention an initiative that interests me directly as the Minister for Justice.

 That is the UN Security Council’s decision to establish an ad hoc International Tribunal for  the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations in International Humanitarian  Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, as well as an International  Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Recent Genocide and other 

 violations of International Humanitarian Law in Rwanda

 The Australian Government also supports the wider, long term proposal of the International  Law Commission to establish a permanent draft Statute on an International Criminal Court  which would have universal jurisdiction to try war crimes, with an independent prosecuting  authority.

 The rapporteur of the ILC with regard to this reference was an Australian, Professor James  Crawford. A draft Statute for the formation of the court has been submitted to the United  Nations General Assembly , which has now established an ad hoc committee open to all  states and specialised agencies of the United Nations to review the major substantive and 

 administrative issues arising out of the draft Statute .

 In the immediate sense however the fact remains that increasingly sophisticated warfare  maims and kills more and more innocent civilians caught in its web. Respect for, and  commitment to, abiding by international humanitarian law, is declining in many areas of our

 Second Regional Conference on International Humanitarian Law Canberra, 12 December 1994 7

 globe. Our Asian-Pacific Region has its own serious troubles. This must be of concern to us  all.

 Yet we can play a role in reversing this disturbing trend. Through mechanisms such as this  Conference countries can be galvanised into supporting international humanitarian law and  fostering cooperation and compliance.

 This Conference provides us with a window of opportunity. We must make the most of it -  for so many anguished citizens of our world community. Those for whom the principles of  international humanitarian law are being ignored. For the civilians caught in warzones, and  their children, we who are in a position to begin the process of change must do so.
