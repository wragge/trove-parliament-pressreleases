 The Australian Values Education Framework: No justification required? 

 Dr Sue Knight & Dr Carol Collins 

 

 It has long been argued that education should be directed towards both individual 

 and social ends.1  In the West, the social end has been identified with the 

 development of a just democracy, so that the fundamental goal of education is seen 

 as one of equipping individuals to function optimally as members of a just democratic 

 society.    Now however these social and individual ends are to be spelled out, it 

 seems clear that optimal individual functioning, as well as just democracy, requires 

 individuals to be disposed to exercise sound moral judgment.   This finds expression 

 in the 1999 Adelaide Declaration on National Goals for Schooling: 

 National Goal 1 

 …When students leave school they should (1.3)… have the capacity to 

 exercise judgment in matters of morality, ethics and social justice…to make 

 rational and informed decisions about their own lives and to accept 

 responsibility for their actions… . 

 

 (http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/policy_initiatives_reviews/national_goals_for_schoolin

 g_in_the_twenty_first_century.htm ) 

 

 In the Adelaide declaration then, we haven acknowledgement that moral (or values) 

 education is a critical part of Australian education in the years of compulsory 

 schooling. 

 

 Subsequently though, governmental advisory committees have pointed to what they 

 see as a ‘values vacuum’ in our schools.  They have suggested that a number of 

 factors, particularly the move away from religion and the growth of multi-culturalism in 

 Australia, have led teachers and schools to shy away from values education for fear 

 of indoctrination.  

 In 2002, in response to such concerns, the Ministerial Council of Education, 

 Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) called for a large-scale study to 

 inform the development of a framework and set of principles for Values Education in 

 Australian Schools. The study (which involved a literature review, and contributions 

 

 1 In the West, the argument goes back at least as far as Plato.  See his Republic, translated by  H.D.P. Lee, Penguin Classics, 1955. 

  2 

 from a range of consultants as well as surveys of school community groups) 

 identified two main approaches to values education: 

 1. Character education, in which values education is seen as the teaching of societal 

 values).   

 &  

 2. A ‘development  of moral reasoning’ approach, in which students not only engage 

 in values clarification exercises but are also are taught the skills required for making 

 moral judgments or decisions. 

 

 The study pointed to the possibility of employing a synthesis of both approaches, but 

 importantly, it also identified a set of nine “Common Australian Values” (see below), 

 and in so doing, set the direction for a  ‘common values’ approach’ to moral 

 education in Australian schools.  In response to the study, the federal government 

 has provided funding of $29.7 million, to implement this common values programme.(

 Nine Values for Australian Schooling 

 1. Care and Compassion 

 Care for self and others 

 2. Doing Your Best 

 Seek to accomplish something worthy and admirable, try hard, pursue excellence 

 3. Fair Go 

 Pursue and protect the common good where all people are treated fairly for a just society 

 4. Freedom 

 Enjoy all the rights and privileges of Australian citizenship free from unnecessary interference or control, 

 and stand up for the rights of others 

 5. Honesty and Trustworthiness 

 Be honest, sincere and seek the truth 

 6. Integrity 

 Act in accordance with principles of moral and ethical conduct, ensure consistency between words and 

 deeds 

 7. Respect 

 Treat others with consideration and regard, respect another person’s point of view 

 8. Responsibility 

 Be accountable for one’s own actions, resolve differences in constructive, non-violent and peaceful 

 ways, contribute to society and to civic life, take care of the environment 

 9. Understanding, Tolerance and Inclusion 

 Be aware of others and their cultures, accept diversity within a democratic society, being included and 

 including others

 While those of us who have been working in this area for many years welcome this 

 emphasis on and support for moral education, we want to argue that the Australian 

 Common Values approach has some serious shortcomings.  We would argue that, 

 as it stands, it cannot succeed in meeting the central goal of Values education, that 

 is, the goal of developing in students the capacity and disposition to exercise 

 judgment in matters of morality, ethics and social justice.   

 

 We need to take a closer look at the set of ‘Values for Australian Schooling’, in order 

 to make our point. In fact, we’ll make a number of points.  

 

 First, the values listed are vague to the point of being empty.   It is this very 

 vagueness which lends some initial plausibility to the claim that these are values held 

 in common.  But even a cursory examination is enough to dispel this illusion.  The 

 problem here is not that the values are described by very general terms.  After all 

 many very general terms are useful; terms like ‘living thing’ or ‘colour’ are examples 

 of such terms, in that they distinguish fairly clearly, one set of objects from another 

 (living from non-living things) or one set of properties from another (colours from 

 shapes, eg). But the terms employed here to pick out the so-called values are not like 

 this.  Take, for example the term describing the third value, the term. ‘Fair go’, 

 spelled out as ‘treating people fairly for a just society’.  To be useful, the term must 

 distinguish one set of behaviours from another.  But now suppose we try to work out 

 which ways of treating people fit under the descriptor ‘treating people fairly’, and 

 which do not.  This might well form the basis of a classroom exercise.  Let’s suppose 

 now, that we set our students such an exercise. 

 

 More particularly, suppose the task we set is that of deciding which, among a number 

 of possible teacher behaviours would count as fair, and which unfair.  Carol recently 

 held such a discussion with a group of 6/7 students in a northern areas school.  

 Some children claimed that it was unfair that a small group of students in the class 

 received additional help in maths and English lessons, arguing that treating people 

 fairly meant treating them equally. Other students disagreed, arguing that many of 

 the students granted extra attention found English really difficult, so that they needed 

 extra help to manage the work. Yet others argued that these students weren’t the 

 only ones who needed help with literacy, and that what was unfair was that all those 

 who needed extra help weren’t given it. Someone suggested that this would cost too 

 much.  This led another student to say that at a previous school her year 7 teacher 

  4 

 had simply ignored those who were not reading fluently, and concentrated on the 

 ‘clever’ ones -it was as though, she said, the teacher had just given up on us.2  

 

 In this discussion we see three conflicting ideas about what counts as a fair go; three 

 different and conflicting ways of distinguishing fair treatment from unfair treatment.  

 And each of these ideas has wide currency within the general community.  

 

 1. Fair treatment involves treating people equally; (We only have to think of 

 Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party) 

 2. Fair treatment involves treating people unequally, with more resources going 

 to those in greater need; (The Labour Party’s now-abandoned education 

 policy from the last election) 

 3. Fair treatment involves treating people unequally, with more resources going 

 to those who are more deserving/ have more merit. 

 

 Clearly, someone who holds the first, ‘equal treatment’ view will consider that treating 

 people in either of the alternate ways mentioned here would constitute unfair 

 treatment, and so would not fit under the descriptor ‘fair go’.  There is no common 

 notion of ‘fair go’ in the way in which there is a common notion of ‘living things’ or 

 ‘colour’. 

 

 Similarly, the second value on the list, i.e. “doing your best” is defined as “seeking to 

 accomplish something worthy and admirable”, but what achievements count as 

 worthy or admirable is not spelled out.  Does it include making money at the expense 

 of others?  Clearly, some members of our society would say ‘yes’, while others would 

 say ‘no’.  Again, it is doubtful whether there is a common notion of ‘worthy 

 achievement’.   

 

 Or what about the value (value 6) of “Integrity”, defined as “acting in accordance with 

 the principles of moral and ethical conduct”.  But what might these principles be?  Are 

 they religious principles?  Are they principles handed down within the family from one 

 generation to another?  Are they derived from the Universal Declaration of Human 

 Rights?  Again, we find considerable difference, rather than common agreement, 

 

 2 See Collins, C (2005) ‘Education for a just democracy: the role of ethical inquiry’, Doctoral  Thesis, University of South Australia, for descriptions of other classroom-based ethical  inquiry sessions.   

  5 

 about what these principles are and why we should adopt them/ where they come 

 from. 

 

 To summarise: A number at least of the so-called common values are empty, open to 

 conflicting interpretations.  Yet, to prescribe one of these interpretations over another 

 is to abandon commonality.  Even were we to succeed in identifying a well-defined 

 set of common values at a local level, that is at the level of a school community - and 

 this is the task schools have been set in the second stage of the National Values 

 Education initiative - two grave difficulties remain.  

 

 The first is this: The Common Values Approach clearly depends on getting the set 

 of values right.  What we might expect then, is to find detailed statements purporting 

 to justify the set of values we end up with.  But we find little or no attempt at 

 justification either within the government documents or their professional 

 development materials, or at the local implementation level ie at the school level. 

 

 Our concern here is that in the absence of justification, the Common Values 

 approach amounts to no more than an appeal to a moral authority.  The dangers of 

 mere appeal to moral authority cannot be underestimated.  And it is surely dangerous 

 to model this practice to our students, to encourage them to adopt values without 

 justification. 

 

 Now for the second and perhaps most obvious difficulty: Equipping students 

 with a set of values is not in itself sufficient to develop their capacity to exercise moral 

 judgement, just as equipping students with the rules of football is not in itself 

 sufficient to develop their ability to play football.   

 

 I guess it seems clear in the case of footy but to make the case for morals, let’s turn 

 to another classroom example.   

 

 Suppose I’m a year 5 teacher; that I’m convinced of the worth of both the values 

 “Honesty” and “Care and Compassion” and committed to working to develop an 

 appreciation of these values in students. We’ve recently been focusing on these 

 values, and the children have been encouraged to put them into practice in their daily 

 lives.  Now Ali, has to make a moral decision.  To her dismay, she is invited by a 

 classmate to play after school.  Understanding the value of care and compassion, 

 she is about to respond with a lie, that she can’t because she has a dentist 

  6 

 appointment.  But then, she recalls their classroom activities on the importance of 

 being honest and wonders whether she should simply say ‘No thanks, I can think of 

 far more interesting things to do.’ In this instance, the values of compassion/caring 

 and honesty clash head on.  To make a decision, Ali needs a principle or procedure 

 to follow here, to help her work out which of these values to override in this particular 

 case.  But the set of values she’s been taught contains no such principle or 

 procedure.    

 

 Here is another example.  On the bus with friends, on the way to work, someone in 

 your group loudly protests that we shouldn’t allow Muslims to settle in Australia 

 because they are too different from us - violence is rife in their culture and so on.  

 Sitting across from you, is a man you know to be a Muslim refugee in Australia on a 

 temporary visa.  Do you stand up for his rights (as the Australian value of “Freedom” 

 directs you to do, or do you nod and say simply, “You’re entitled to your point of view” 

 thus respecting his opinion as the Australian Value of “Respect” directs you to do?  

 Again, we are faced with a clash of values, and no guiding principle or procedure for 

 working out which value is more important in this case.    

 

 The hard moral decisions are just those that result from a clash of values.  This is 

 why, in itself, no set of values is sufficient to deliver a moral judgement.   If we want 

 values or moral education to equip students to make moral judgements, we need to 

 supplement the Common Values approach with a focus on a set of principles or 

 procedures to guide us in dealing with clashes of values.  We want now to consider 

 what these guiding principles and procedures might look like.  

 

 Of course, one line of thought has it that this is an impossible task. 

 After all, people will disagree over whether or not Ali should lie, so saving her 

 classmate’s feelings, or tell the truth, so hurting her classmate’s feelings.   It is likely 

 then, that different people use different principles to resolve value clashes, to decide 

 what ought to be done. What should these principles be?  And how are we to 

 decide on them?  Here, we are faced clearly with the problem that bedevils any 

 approach to values or moral education: the fact of moral disagreement, both 

 within and across cultures.   

 

 I judge torture to be always wrong, but many others, including other Western 

 governments, judge that it is sometimes justified.  I make the judgement that abortion 

 is morally right - many others in this society take it to be morally wrong, tantamount 

  7 

 to murder.  In our society, infanticide is judged to be morally wrong, while there are 

 other cultures who have judged it to be morally right.  Who is to say which of these 

 conflicting judgements count as sound judgements, and which do not?  On what 

 grounds could we make this call?  Perhaps we simply cannot say.   

 

 If we disagree over a factual matter (say) whether smoking is harmful, we at least 

 agree on the sort of evidence that would decide the matter: it is factual evidence 

 about the effect of tobacco on lungs and blood vessels.  But it is less clear what kind 

 of evidence we could appeal to, to show (say) that abortion is sometimes morally 

 right.  Perhaps there isn’t any evidence to draw upon here.  And in the absence of 

 evidence, perhaps we have to simply accept the fact of moral difference?  Surely we 

 cannot condemn another individual’s or another culture’s moral values, just because 

 they differ from ours?  Surely we cannot say that the customs of another society are 

 morally inferior to our own, just because they are different?    

 

 And indeed, the emphasis within current educational policy and curriculum, on being 

 aware of others and their cultures, and accepting (even respecting) diversity and 

 others’ points of view, make us wary of saying that some moral judgements are 

 better than others.  For example, we feel wary about holding that whaling is morally 

 wrong, when it is considered right in Japanese and Norwegian cultures.  We feel 

 wary perhaps about holding that girls and boys should have the same opportunities 

 and rights within the broader community, when this clashes with the cultural values 

 within our schools.  We are wedded pretty firmly to the notion of tolerance, of 

 respecting all values.  In other words, we are headed in the direction of moral 

 relativism.  Indeed the vagueness of Common Australian Values appears to reflect 

 this relativist approach. 

 

 But surely a focus on examples such as racism, slavery or bullying shows us what is 

 wrong with relativism.  Surely these are examples of situations in which we want to 

 exercise particular moral judgements, and indeed, in which we want students to 

 exercise particular moral judgements. We want our students to judge that racism or 

 child abuse or bullying are morally wrong.   

 

 Why do we feel confident about encouraging these judgements in such 

 situations? Given this degree of confidence, it might be worth asking again whether 

 there is any evidence we can point to, to justify our moral decisions?   Can we find 

  8 

 evidence that for example, bullying is wrong?  And surely we can; the evidence lies in 

 the harm/suffering bullying causes. 

 

 We can generalise from this example: 

 

 Morality is grounded in human good and harm (suffering),  

 AND 

 Human beings share common capacities for suffering and for happiness 

 

 Other species have the capacity for suffering too - consider all sentient 

 beings.  Sentient beings are beings that suffer, and humans form a special class of 

 sentient beings.   

 

 These are the general principles which must underlie any set of values, the principles 

 which must form the basis of a moral decision making procedure.  They do not in 

 themselves deliver a moral decision making process of course.  But we can also 

 draw on some other well established elements of ethical reasoning, such as 

 considering as fully as possible the consequences of one’s behaviour, taking 

 circumstances into account and ensuring consistency between one’s beliefs and 

 between one’s beliefs and actions.  By paying close attention to such elements, we 

 can identify a set of capacities which are necessary for the making of reasoned moral 

 judgments.  Such capacities include: 

 

 â¢ Understanding others’ interests 

 â¢ Being aware of one’s own needs, both emotional and physical 

 â¢ Caring about other people’s feelings, so that one has sympathy for others’ 

 needs 

 â¢ Considering as fully as possible the consequences of one’s behaviours 

 (taking all things into consideration before acting, including effect on others, 

 on oneself, one’s character and habits and the direction of one’s life, as well 

 as on the institutions of the society of which one is part)  

 â¢ Distinguishing like from unlike situations, typical from a-typical situations3 

 

 And so on… 

 

 3 Matthew Lipman discusses the elements of ethical reasoning in his ‘Philosophy in the  Classroom’ (1980), Temple University Press, Philadelphia. 

  9 

 

 Surely it is such capacities which any values education programme must seek to 

 develop.  And more than this, children must be given opportunities to practice and 

 refine the use of these capacities and to understand and appreciate their value.  It is 

 only in this way that students will begin to develop a disposition to engage widely in 

 reasoned moral decision making.    

 

 It seems odd then, that this approach to Values Education has not been given more 

 careful consideration given the strength of these theoretical arguments, the fact that 

 we have at hand educational resources which would support teachers to implement 

 the approach (indeed, that a dialogue-based ethical inquiry approach to Values 

 Education is already being implemented successfully  here and elsewhere-remember our earlier example of Carol’s classroom work) and given also that there is 

 a growing body of empirical evidence, including evidence from local studies, which 

 indicates that such an approach is effective in developing individuals’ capacities and 

 dispositions for moral reasoning.   

 

 In summing up, we would argue that it is not too late for this ethical inquiry approach 

 to Values Education to be taken up alongside the existing Common Values 

 approach.  Were this to happen, the teacher’s role would change from that of 

 adjusting the child to society, to one of educating children in such a fashion that they 

 can eventually come to shape society for the better.

 Societies’ seminar on ‘Values and Ethics across the Curriculum’ - Three Current 

 Perspectives, Wednesday June 7th, Mawson Lakes Campus, University of South
