 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Regional WA Home to more and more Migrants

 VPS 014/2004

 Bunbury, Busselton, Albany, Kalgoorlie and Karratha are among the many towns in regional areas of Western Australia  where more and more migrants are choosing to settle.

 But we need to do more and the initiatives I announced today with the Acting Prime Minister, John Anderson, will help to  attract more migrants and refugees to Australia's regional areas.

 At the last Census, some 5,220 people living in Albany were born overseas, a majority of whom were born in England and  New Zealand.

 That was also the case for Bunbury where 4,800 people were born overseas the majority of whom were from England and  New Zealand.

 In Busselton 3,100 were born overseas, and New Zealand and England again topped the list as the country of birth.

 The same could be said for Kalgoorlie, with an overseas born population of 4,150, and the majority coming from England and  New Zealand.

 In the Karratha area, some 2,256 people were born overseas, of whom a majority was born in England and New Zealand.

 In 2002-2003, some 580 visas were granted to people under State-specific and regional migration initiatives for Western  Australia - an increase of approximately 70 percent over the 2001-02 financial year. 

 Since 1997-98 some 2,200 visas have been granted to people who were planning to settle in Western Australia under the  various regional migration programs.

 Visa grants for regional areas are steadily increasing, but more can be done to assist regional Australia to get the people they  want and this is what the measures being announced today aim to do.

 From 1 July, qualified people who want to come to Australia as skilled migrants will be able to obtain a three-year temporary  residence visa if they commit to living and working in regional Australia. After two years they will be able to apply for  permanent residency.

 There is also a new visa for self-funded independent retirees to encourage them to settle in regional areas.Under this visa,  participating state and territory governments will be able to sponsor self-funded retirees settling in regional Australia. 

 Self-funded retirees provide an opportunity for Australia to benefit both from their capital investment and the money they 

 spend while in Australia.
