 AUSTRALIA INCREASES AID TO AFGHANISTAN

 I am pleased to announce Australia will contribute a further $17 million in reconstruction assistance and emergency relief for Afghanistan, bringing total Australian assistance to $40.3 million.

 This additional assistance from Australia is being announced today by the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Chris Gallus MP, at the international donors meeting in Tokyo.

 Australia's assistance to Afghanistan is focused on addressing some of the most pressing needs of the Afghan people. Our assistance to date has been well-received as timely and appropriate.

 Critical areas of assistance in the initial stages of Afghanistan's recovery will include food aid, establishing essential infrastructure, and resettlement assistance for displaced people.

 These areas have been addressed in the assistance announced today. Complete details of the $17 million are still being finalised, but initial allocations will include an additional $1.5 million to Australian non-government organizations to provide technical assistance in rebuilding Afghanistan and $2 million for food aid. It will also include $500,000 to UNICEF for women and children's winter survival, immunisation and nutrition, and $3 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for assistance to displaced Afghans.

 Other assistance to international agencies will include $1 million to the United Nations Development Program's Regional Humanitarian Coordinator's Office, $500,000 to the United Nations Drug Control Programme to combat opium production, $500,000 for mine action activities and, as announced in December, $1million to the United Nations Development Program's Trust for the Afghan Interim Authority

 I am also releasing today details of the remaining $10 million from the $23.3 million Afghanistan assistance package announced last year. A major proportion of this, $7 million, will assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop sustainable solutions, protection programs and integration activities for displaced Afghans in South West Asia, bringing to $14.3 million Australia's additional aid to UNHCR. The funds also include $2 million to assist the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Afghanistan, including $500,000 for family reunification, and $1 million to the International Organisation for Migration for assistance with resettlement and migration.
