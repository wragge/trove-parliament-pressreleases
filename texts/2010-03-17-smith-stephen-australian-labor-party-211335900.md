 Ministerial Statement on Sri Lanka 

 17 March 2010 

 I wish to update the House on the situation in Sri Lanka since my last report to the House on 

 14 September last year. 

 In particular, I want to update the House on the ongoing political and humanitarian 

 challenges facing Sri Lanka and Australia's strengthened financial and diplomatic support for 

 the people of Sri Lanka to help Sri Lanka meet these challenges. 

 I highlight some recent progress on resettling internally displaced civilians, which is an 

 immense task. 

 I underscore Australia's long-standing bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka, underpinned by 

 substantial people-to-people links. Our bilateral cooperation continues to expand in 

 important areas, including combating people smuggling and human trafficking. Addressing 

 transnational issues such as these is important, not only to Sri Lanka and Australia but to our 

 region. 

 I do so at a time when President Mahinda Rajapaksa has recently been re-elected, following 

 Sri Lanka's first nation-wide election after over two decades of conflict. And at a time when 

 Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary elections on 8 April. 

 Political challenges 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, as I said in my statement to the Parliament in September last year, 

 the military victory in Sri Lanka has changed the situation on the ground irrevocably.  

 During my visit to Sri Lanka in November last year, I urged the Sri Lankan Government to 

 win the peace, after decades-long military conflict, by forging an enduring political settlement 

 for all Sri Lankans. 

 I acknowledged that this would not be easy. Nor would it occur overnight. It would come only 

 after a process of political reform and rapprochement between all parties and communities.  

 While the outside world could help in practical ways, the solution needed to come from within 

 Sri Lanka, from the people of Sri Lanka.  

 The re-elected Sri Lankan Government has both a special responsibility and opportunity to 

 use its second term to promote the political freedoms and the reforms, including the 

 empowerment of minority communities, that will enable all citizens to have a stake in the 

 country's future. 

 Australia believes that Sri Lanka's democracy, its rule of law and its national security would 

 be enhanced by a stronger civil society and an independent and free media.  

 Such freedoms could enhance Sri Lanka's prospects for lasting reconciliation. 

 Another crucial part of the reconciliation and peace building process is the proper conduct of 

 elections. In this regard, it was notable that polling for the Presidential election proceeded 

 reasonably peacefully in most areas. 

 There were, however, reports of violence and possible violations of election law in the lead 

 up to and following the Presidential election.  

 As we approach the 8 April parliamentary elections, Australia urges the Government of Sri 

 Lanka and its civil institutions to ensure that there are credible investigations into past 

 election incidents and measures are put in place to prevent similar problems arising again. 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, as Members would be aware, the former Army Chief and 

 Presidential candidate General Fonseka was taken into detention on 8 February and faces 

 charges of undertaking political activities while still in the military and violating military 

 procurement guidelines.  

 General Fonseka was brought before a military court at Navy Headquarters on 16 of this 

 month and is due to appear again today. General Fonseka is challenging the legality of his 

 detention through Sri Lanka's Supreme Court. 

 The international community, including Australia, has been and is watching these 

 developments closely.  

 Australia has underlined the importance of General Fonseka and his supporters being 

 treated fairly and transparently in accordance with Sri Lankan law. 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, decades of civil war have impacted terribly and adversely on Sri 

 Lankan civilians.  

 Australia made repeated calls during the conflict, and since, for all parties to make the 

 welfare and protection of civilians the absolute priority, and for international law to be 

 respected.  

 Australia has called on the Sri Lankan Government to investigate allegations of human rights 

 violations and violations of international law.  

 Proper and transparent investigation of these allegations is an important step towards 

 reconciliation. 

 We welcomed the announcement by the Sri Lankan Government on 26 October 2009 that it 

 would establish an Expert Committee to investigate allegations contained in the recent US 

 State Department's Report to Congress on Incidents during the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka.  

 The deadline for the Committee's report was extended from 31 December last year to the 30 

 April this year.  

 It is important that the Expert Committee moves more quickly to progress its investigations 

 and implement its findings. We look forward to the Committee's report, due by 30 April 2010. 

 I welcome President Rajapaksa's re-election statement on 27 January in which he 

 committed to govern for all Sri Lankans, build on the peace already achieved and move 

 forward on a reconciliation program. 

 Others have indicated a willingness to explore options for reconciliation and long term 

 stability.  

 The Tamil National Alliance said in its platform for parliamentary elections that it would 

 accept a "federal structure" in the north-east. Obviously this is a sensitive political issue for 

 Sri Lankans to resolve. 

 Australia encourages all political voices to engage together in a sincere process to achieve 

 lasting political reconciliation in Sri Lanka.  

 Humanitarian challenges 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, following my visit to Sri Lanka over 9-10 November last year, which 

 was the first by an Australian Foreign Minister since 2004, it was very clear that the 

 humanitarian task facing Sri Lanka was immense. 

 Australia has been a close observer of the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka both during 

 the recent intensified fighting and since the end of the military conflict in May 2009.  

 Throughout, Australia has stressed the need to make the welfare of civilians an absolute 

 priority.  

 Australia held concerns about the camps for internally displaced people and we put these 

 concerns directly to the Sri Lankan Government at the time, calling for freedom of movement 

 for displaced persons and management of the camps in accordance with international 

 humanitarian standards. 

 My discussions with the Sri Lankan Government in November 2009, including with President 

 Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Bogollagama, revealed that progress had been made in 

 tackling the challenging task of resettling hundreds of thousands of displaced citizens and 

 rehabilitating their communities.  

 However, for several reasons - including the scale of the resettlement task - the Sri Lankan 

 Government was not able to meet its self imposed deadline of 31 January for completing the 

 return of all internally displaced people to their place of origin. 

 This process is continuing. Of the nearly 300,000 civilians displaced by the conflict, over 

 185,000 have been released and are either living in their own homes or - in greater numbers 

 - with host families.  

 Living conditions in the 12 remaining camps, which now house over 90,000 internally 

 displaced people, continue to be difficult but reduced numbers have relieved the problem of 

 over-crowding.  

 Efforts are being made to meet the basic needs of people still in these camps and essential 

 services are being provided. 

 During my November visit to Colombo, I discussed with the Sri Lankan Government the 

 importance of freedom of movement for all internally displaced civilians. 

 Accordingly, Australia welcomed the Sri Lankan Government's announcement of 1 

 December last year which allowed freer movement for people in the camps.  

 Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of that decision to travel outside the 

 camps. 

 Many of these civilians and those recently resettled have suffered immensely through 

 decades of conflict which has resulted in significant trauma for many Sri Lankans. 

 In addition to the situation in the camps and resettlement areas, we remain watchful of the 

 conditions for over 10,000 individuals who have been separated from the civilian population 

 and held in detention as ex-combatants.  

 We urge the Sri Lankan government to regularise the legal status of this group and afford 

 international agencies access to those so held in detention. 

 Enhanced diplomatic efforts 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, Australia has adopted an enhanced diplomatic and humanitarian 

 effort to help Sri Lanka address the challenges of recovery from over two decades of civil 

 war. 

 On 2 November last year, the Prime Minister announced the appointment of Mr John 

 McCarthy as Australia's Special Representative to Sri Lanka.  

 Mr McCarthy's role has reinforced the messages that I and Australia's High Commissioner in 

 Colombo have put to the Sri Lankan Government on the importance of - and Australia's 

 support for - stabilisation and resettlement of internally displaced civilians within Sri Lanka. 

 Special Representative McCarthy has also engaged with the international community widely 

 on the challenges faced by Sri Lanka.  

 He has been consulting extensively on the importance of supporting reconstruction and 

 rehabilitation programs in the north of the country. These programs are important both for 

 humanitarian reasons and for laying the foundations for lasting peace. 

 Mr McCarthy visited Colombo with me in November and has just completed a further visit to 

 Sri Lanka this month, where he again met President Rajapaksa.  

 During this February visit, Mr McCarthy was also able to travel north with our High 

 Commissioner to the Jaffna Peninsula where they visited camps for internally displaced 

 civilians and resettlement areas, and met local government and community leaders. 

 In a number of discussions overseas, both in the corridors of international meetings and 

 bilateral visits, including in London in January and in New Delhi in March, I underlined the 

 importance of international support to assist Sri Lanka to meet its challenges. 

 Humanitarian assistance 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, Australia continues to respond generously to the humanitarian 

 challenges facing Sri Lanka.  

 Our aid program is targeted to meet the needs of displaced civilians, their resettlement and 

 the rehabilitation of their communities. 

 Our aid efforts in the camps are focussed on the well-being of internally displaced people, 

 and not on the camps being a long-term settlement option.  

 The proper, transparent and compassionate treatment of those citizens of the north and east 

 will be important for post-conflict reconciliation in Sri Lanka.  

 It is for this reason that Australia continues to advocate resettlement of all remaining 

 displaced persons in safe and dignified conditions as soon as possible. 

 Australian officials in Sri Lanka are working closely with central and local government 

 authorities and community groups to determine how best Australia can continue to address 

 the needs of the displaced, and support their resettlement and rehabilitation.  

 A senior AusAID official visited resettlement areas in Northern Sri Lanka in late February for 

 this very purpose. 

 In many cases resettlement areas have been badly affected by the conflict.  

 There are impassable roads, destroyed houses and a lack of potable water. Infrastructure, 

 including schools and health facilities, is damaged or non-existent. Large swathes of 

 agricultural land are as yet unusable and tools to restart livelihoods are scarce.  

 In addition, there is the ever-present danger of landmines and unexploded ordnance. 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, demining is an essential first step to allow people to return home 

 and rebuild their lives and their communities.  

 For this reason, Australia has already announced its commitment to provide up to $20 million 

 for demining over the next five years to ensure that the northern part of Sri Lanka can be 

 made safe for resettlement.  

 Aid announcement 

 In November 2009 following my visit to Sri Lanka I informed the House that Australia was 

 looking favourably to assisting both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank on 

 their reconstruction projects in the north and in the east.  

 In Singapore in the margins of APEC I had a conversation with Mr Zoellick, the Executive 

 Director of the World Bank, indicating Australia's in-principle support for those reconstruction 

 efforts so far as the World Bank is concerned. 

 Today I announce that Australia will provide an additional $20 million in targeted assistance 

 for Sri Lanka. 

 This support will be delivered through international organisations who are making a practical 

 contribution to stabilisation efforts. 

 It is focussed on enabling people to return to their homes, their communities and to re-establish the economic and social infrastructure required for recovery. 

 $12 million will be provided to the World Bank to co-finance their Emergency Northern 

 Reconstruction Project.  

 Over an 18 month period, the World Bank project plans to help over 100,000 displaced 

 people by providing cash grants, raising standards of living and rebuilding essential 

 community infrastructure.  

 Australian funding will go directly to resettling families, allowing them to regain some control 

 over their own lives and to start repairing their houses and clearing their fields and wells. 

 Our assistance will also provide seeds and essential farming and fishing implements to 

 improve food security. 

 $8 million will be provided to co-finance the Asian Development Bank's North East 

 Community Restoration and Development Project. 

 This project aims to rapidly improve living conditions by restoring basic social infrastructure 

 including critical health facilities and schools. 

 It will restore village roads, provide irrigation and water supply schemes and restore 

 electricity supplies. 

 It will give priority to districts affected by conflict including parts of Vavuniya, Jaffna, Mannar 

 and Kilinochchi. 

 The assistance I am announcing today builds on Australia's existing support for housing to 

 enable internally displaced people to be resettled more quickly.  

 Large scale damage to basic housing infrastructure in the north remains a critical challenge, 

 with the total number of houses damaged or destroyed reported to exceed 230,000.  

 Madam Deputy Speaker this announcement and support follows on from the $3 million 

 Australia provided in November 2009 to UN Habitat to provide cash grants to affected 

 families for quick repairs and longer term reconstruction of housing, as well as restoring land 

 titles. 

 Bilateral Relationship 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, Sri Lanka is important to Australia. Australia and Sri Lanka share 

 strong bilateral relations, built on our shared Commonwealth membership, as well as links in 

 trade and investment, defence, education, sport, culture and development cooperation and 

 assistance.  

 The people-to-people links between Australia and Sri Lanka are strong with around 100,000 

 people of Sri Lankan extraction now living in Australia, contributing to all aspects of our 

 society.  

 The opportunity now exists for the Sri Lankan diaspora to play a constructive role in 

 promoting the conditions for sustainable peace. I urge the diaspora to look forward and work 

 in positive ways to help communities inside Sri Lanka realise a peaceful future for 

 themselves. 

 Australia is committed to working with Sri Lanka to help address the serious challenges 

 facing today's world, including counter-terrorism and people smuggling, climate change and 

 organised transnational crime.  

 Such issues require global solutions and Australia is firmly committed to supporting and 

 enhancing the vital role of multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, in meeting 

 these challenges. 

 People smuggling is an issue that affects our entire region, not just Australia. 

 We are working more closely than ever before with international organisations, in particular 

 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and with regional partners 

 to combat this issue, through such groupings as the Bali Process on People Smuggling, 

 Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. 

 People smuggling remains a high-priority transnational issue for source, transit and 

 destination countries in our region, including Australia and Sri Lanka. 

 People smugglers and people smuggling syndicates work without regard for human safety or 

 national legal frameworks. 

 Australia is working together with Sri Lanka to address people smuggling.  

 In a Joint Ministerial Statement I issued with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister on 9 November 

 last year, Australia and Sri Lanka reaffirmed our continuing commitment to work together to 

 combat people smuggling and related organised criminal activities, including: 

 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ enhancing cooperation to bring to justice the criminal organisers of the people 

 smuggling trade; 

 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ taking a leading role to promote regional cooperation to act against transnational 

 people smuggling networks, and 

 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ undertaking a public information campaign to alert Sri Lankan citizens to the dangers 

 of maritime people smuggling. 

 We acknowledged our ongoing constructive bilateral cooperation between key domestic 

 operational agencies and underlined our commitment to work together in practical ways to 

 address people smuggling issues in a cooperative and comprehensive manner. 

 Conclusion 

 Madam Deputy Speaker, Sri Lanka is emerging from a long period of conflict and insecurity 

 towards greater stability. With new presidential and parliamentary terms soon to begin, now 

 more than ever is the time to forge a new beginning for all its citizens and take forward 

 national reconciliation and lasting peace. 

 As a long-time friend, Australia has been, and will continue to be, committed to working with 

 Sri Lanka to build a peaceful and prosperous future for all Sri Lankans.
