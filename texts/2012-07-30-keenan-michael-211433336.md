 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling ANOTHER TWO BOATS AS LABOR’S  BORDER MESS GROWS DAILY July 30, 2012

 The 89 people who arrived on two more illegal boats will join more than 10,000 asylum seekers still in detention and on bridging  visas,  creating  a  long  backlog  of  cases  that  could  take  years  to  resolve,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "More  than  10,000  boat  arrivals  are  now  in  the  system  under  this  government  including  some  7,000  in  detention  and community detention and 3,000 released into the community on bridging visas most of who have already had their initial asylum claims rejected," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Every new boat that arrives means the mess Labor has created on our borders gets worse. 

 "Labor's failure has brought over 21,000 people by boat including over 5,600 since they provided people arriving on illegal boats with direct access to our court system for endless appeals, starting with the Refugee Review Tribunal. 

 "All this means it could take up to a decade to deal with the remnants of Labor's failure on our borders. 

 "The Coalition will stop the boats in government but the mess we will have to clean up will just get bigger as each new boat arrives under Labor's border failures," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "The Gillard Labor Government is only one illegal boat shy of reaching 100 illegal boat arrivals carrying almost 7,000 people in 2012 alone, with 99 illegal boats having arrived this year carrying 6,988 people. 

 "It  is  a  sad  reality  that  mainstream  Customs  are  suffering  as  a  result  of  this  Government's  complete  inability  to  protect Australia's  borders  from  this  influx  of  illegal  arrivals,  with  371  boats  having  arrived  since  they  dismantled  a  perfectly functioning border protection regime. 

 "It is now common practice for Customs to be forced by the Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, to move precious resources up north to help intercept and ferry this constant deluge of boats. 

 "Labor continue to savage mainstream Customs to keep up with this extraordinary rate of one or two boat arrivals per day â it is no wonder illicit drugs and weapons are flowing through onto our streets as Customs no longer have the resources and staff to maintain thorough checks. 

 "The system is at breaking point and the bad experiment that is the Greens/Labor governing alliance has proven to be  nothing but chaotic and harmful to the integrity of our borders," Mr Keenan said.
