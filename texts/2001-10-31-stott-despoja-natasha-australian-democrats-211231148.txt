 Asia Australia Institute speech: Terror in the USA - Fallout for Australia and its Asian neighbours

 I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land.

 I am pleased to be addressing the Asia-Australia Institute for the first time, though I wish it was on a more positive topic.

 I am also honoured to be sharing the stage with Professor Robert Manne and Hugh White.

 Most people will always remember where they were on September 11th when they heard of the terrorist attacks in America.

 The toll is more than three thousand dead, from all over the world, including fifteen Australians.

 The painful loss is felt by his family and many friends is replicated hundreds of times across the nation and thousands of times across the globe.

 But there is no quick salve and justice may be slow. Courage, compassion and common sense must guide us. We must respect the rule of law - domestic and international - and the rules of war, including that civilians are not legitimate targets, and that the ultimate aim is peace.

 One of the things that was so horrific about the terrorist attacks in America is that they targeted civilians. The difference between civilians and service personnel is one that civilised nations hold dear.

 Large numbers of civilian deaths from the bombings in Afghanistan could undermine what public support there is for Australia’s involvement in this war.

 The emotional, economic and political fallout of the terrorist attacks, highlights how interlinked the world has become.

 Domestic impacts include the cancelling of CHOGM, which allowed the date of the federal election to be brought forward. Also, a renewed focus on asylum seekers, and numbers, will inevitably increase out of the military conflict in Afghanistan

 Another significant impact is the commitment of Australian troops to that conflict.

 Future fallout could include an expanded military commitment.

 Instability in our region, could be another impact. This would lead to greater numbers of asylum seekers.

 The Democrats believe that Australia cannot continue to handle the issue of asylum seekers using the Navy. For a start, our military may soon be over committed.

 On the 17th October the Prime Minister announced the commitment of 1550 Australian troops.

 The Prime Minister contacted me that morning to inform me that this was occurring and I appreciate him doing so. The political reality is that Australian troops are going. The bulk of forces will be overseas by the middle of November.

 Our immediate concern, now, is for the 1550 Australian Service personnel, as well as those of other countries, who will be deployed, and for the innocent civilians of Afghanistan.

 The Prime Minister originally made an open ended commitment, although he has now clarified that somewhat, but he has said that requests for further support would be considered.

 In the last decade, when Australian troops have been committed overseas, the Government has put the issue before the Parliament, first. In January 1991 for the Gulf War, the Parliament was reconvened at the Democrats urging (and we voted against Australia’s involvement), and for the East Timor commitment, the Parliament was already sitting.

 The Democrats requested (in the last sitting of Parliament), that the Prime Minister allow the commitment of troops to be debated. It was not. The Democrats have said that the Parliament should be reconvened at the first opportunity after the election.

 In September, the Parliament passed a condolence motion over the terrorist attacks in the United States. Included in the motion was reference to our obligation under the ANZUS treaty and a very general endorsement of the Government’s commitment to support United States led action. Troops were not mentioned.

 The Democrats were obviously very keen that the condolence motion be passed, but I clarified what the scope of the motion must mean. Specifically, that, it did not constitute parliament approval for an open-ended commitment of Australian troops.

 I also took the opportunity to clarify the reference in the motion to article IV of the ANZUS Treaty and the involvement of the United Nations.

 We believe the war against terrorism can be fought in ways other than militarily. For a start it requires international cooperation. The United Nations provides an important forum for negotiation, as it did during the 1991 Gulf war. Nations should be encouraged to pursue cooperation, communication and trust building measures.

 Since September we have argued that Australia should sign and ratify the outstanding United Nations’ terrorism conventions, ratify the statute of the International Criminal Court and continue to support the use of UN sanctions against countries that harbour terrorist groups. As Senator Bourne, has repeatedly pointed out: Our security interests lie in building confidence in the international community. We must work to foster institutions that will enable nations to cooperate in the face of these new threats.

 There is a great desire in our sorrow, to do something. But it must be effective and it must be proportional. If Afghanistan was wiped off the map, there is not any guarantee Osama Bin Laden would be dead. It would certainly not bring peace.

 The US launched raids on Southern Afghanistan, following bombings of American embassies in 1998. Clearly that military campaign against Osama Bin Laden and other terrorists did not work. There is no guarantee that this military campaign will work either.

 The United States and its allies, have enormous firepower, but must find their target.

 Military retaliation that strikes the innocent, is not only morally wrong, but counterproductive. The aim is to reduce risks rather than to inflame tensions and escalate conflict.

 Australia should be concerned about the fallout of the war on terrorism in our region in terms of creating instability and the impact on human rights.

 The countries of our region that are most affected by the terrorist attack and the military campaign - both economically and in terms of potential instability - are probably Indonesia and Malaysia.

 About two thirds of Malaysia’s 23 million people are Muslim. While the Leader, Mahathir, has been guarded in giving support for US military actions, these events present Mahathir the opportunity to toughen attacks on his opponents, the Islamic Party of Malaysia.

 The situation in Indonesia is similar but potentially more explosive. About 85% of Indonesia’s 210 million people are Muslim - it is the world’s largest Muslim country. It will certainly feel the impact of reduced tourism and reduced foreign investment.

 Leader Megawatti has a delicate balancing act to maintain order. She was the first foreign leader to fly to Washington after 11 September, winning the restoration of military assistance and increased economic aid from the US.

 Once she returned she distanced herself from the military campaign saying, “blood cannot be cleansed with blood”.

 Indonesia could face widened political divisions and an escalation of violence.

 One of the main areas of tension and potential flashpoint is Aceh, the oil and gas rich province in the north-west, where the Free Aceh separatist movement has campaigned for decades.

 Less well known is Maluka in the East where a fight between Christians and Muslins that began almost three years ago has cost about 5,000 lives.

 The Indonesian Government is likely to want to portray the separatists in Aceh as terrorists.

 One of our concerns on the human rights front is what the rush to find new allies in the war against terrorism means for human rights and democracy.

 In waging a 'war on terror' we need to be very clear on exactly what terrorism is.

 The enemy cannot be identified by a religion or a race, but by their actions.

 And if we inflame racial and religious based hatred and intolerance, the terrorists will have struck another blow.

 Very little will have been achieved if efforts to secure freedom from terrorism, result in the undermining of oppressed people's legitimate desire to pursue fundamental human rights.

 Promoting respect for human rights in general, is in our long term security interest.

 There are some sections of the population whose response to the terrorist attacks have been to attack the Muslim community in Australia. We have also seen Government Ministers attempt to link asylum seekers to terrorism.

 Hiram Warren, in a speech to the United States Senate in the early 20th Century said “The first casualty when war comes, is truth”. Certainly truth is often a casualty in an election campaign.

 I have been horrified by the willingness of some members of this Government to make false accusations against the Australian Democrats, implying that the Democrats did not join in the condemnation of the acts of terrorism. The Democrats have said quite clearly that those responsible for the attacks must be brought to justice and be punished for their crime.

 A letter to the editor in The Advertiser this week said I should “Go and sit with the families of Americans and Australians killed in the attack and explain to them why a course of less resistance is best.”

 I recognise that families are feeling pain and sorrow. That does not make bombing Afghanistan the appropriate action. Striking out blindly is not the answer. We need to pursue a just response, the use of forums such as the United Nations, and the long term aim of peace.

 The Australian Democrats have expressed our serious concerns about Australia's involvement in the war in Afghanistan.

 The Democrats believe Australia should urge the United States to stop the bombing of Afghanistan. If depleted uranium is being used in those bombs, as it was in Iraq, troops and the people of Afghanistan will be exposed to depleted uranium dispersed over wide areas.

 What we have called for and what we need in this country is an informed debate, and the Democrats have certainly been listening to the experts in the field, such Dr William Maley, Head of the Refugee Council, a Professor of Politics at the Australian Defence Force Academy and a specialist on Afghani issues.

 We are told this could be a long drawn out campaign with operations spread more widely than Afghanistan.

 We do not know how long our troops are likely to be involved or what the real objectives of the operations are.

 Already there have been significant numbers of innocent casualties. Will Australian troops be involved in operations that will risk civilian lives?

 As I have said, we are also concerned that the alliances we are building with countries in the region may lead to repression of legitimate political dissent in those countries. The war against terrorism must not be used as a tool to prop up autocratic and repressive regimes.

 Most of all the Democrats are concerned that Australia make a commitment to rebuilding peace in the region in the long run.

 A substantial diplomatic and humanitarian effort will be needed to bring about peace and real security from terrorism. International cooperation will be vital for rebuilding Afghanistan, achieving peace in the Middle East, and addressing the bitter, grinding poverty that fosters extremism and fundamentalism.

 Australia has tried to assist countries work towards a peaceful, democratic society including our involvement in Cambodia, Bougainville and East Timor.

 The Australian Democrats have called on the Government to undertake a massive review of its commitments to foreign aid in the light of the impending humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.

 The Australian Democrats welcomed the recent announcement of $14 million to assist the efforts of humanitarian organisations operating in South West Asia. But it pales into insignificance when we think of the $100 million even a low-level Australian military commitment to Afghanistan is likely to cost, or the $100 million they have already spent on their attempts to ‘outsource’ the refugee problem.

 The Taliban movement grew in the misery of the refugee camps from the last Afghan war. Eradicating poverty is not only compassionate, it is also smart security policy.

 The Government has slashed the overseas aid budget to its lowest level in 30 years at only .25% of GNP. This is a long way from the .7% the United Nations recommends. Now, more than ever, Australia should be a generous donor of overseas aid.

 The Government should be looking at the linkages between aid and defence in maintaining regional security. We should consider how food security, poverty reduction, education and health programs enhance regional security and reduce the flow of asylum seekers.

 Security problems in our region will include not just terrorism and people smuggling, but arms, and drugs smuggling, and religious conflicts. These are issues that need to be confronted not just with security forces but with multilateral diplomatic efforts.

 We must continue to pursue peacekeeping, diplomacy, intelligence gathering, overseas aid, and promoting democracy.
