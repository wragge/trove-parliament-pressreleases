 MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN LET’S PARTICIPATE

 There’s never been a better way to learn about Australian citizenship following the launch of Let’s Participate: A course in Australian Citizenship, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, said today.

 “Let’s participate is an initiative introduced by the Federal Government to teach migrants about Australian culture and assist their integration into the community,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “Originally available only to clients enrolled in the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), following considerable external interest in, and demand for, the course, it will now be available to any interested organisation or individual.”

 Topics covered by the course include Australian geography, national symbols and emblems, the values and principles of Australian society, multiculturalism and reconciliation, Australia’s system of government and law, and how to become an Australian citizen.

 Mr Hardgrave described the AMEP Australian citizenship initiative as an excellent example of the AMEP’s capacity to link with and complement the range of settlement services provided by the Federal Government.  This ensures a cohesive, harmonious society that maximises Australia’s multicultural diversity and enables the successful settlement of migrants and refugees.

 “Since its establishment in 1948 more than 1.6 million migrants and refugees have benefited from the English language tuition and settlement support provided by the AMEP,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “With an annual budget of more than $100 million and providing over 6 million hours of English language tuition, the AMEP plays an important role in helping newcomers to become active and accepted members of the Australian community,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “Many of the 4000 AMEP clients who have successfully completed Let’s participate have gone on to take out Australian citizenship and become members of the Australian family.

 “This can only enhance their sense of belonging and, more broadly, it can only enhance the cohesion and harmony of the society in which we live.”

 Let’s participate will be available for sale to non-AMEP clients following its official relaunch by Mr Hardgrave on 27 November in Brisbane. Curriculum materials may be ordered through the AMEP Research Centre at Macquarie University, Sydney.
