  ADDITIONAL AUSTRALIAN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
TO THE KOSOVO REGION

  

  The Australian Government will provide further immediate assistance 
to assist with the tragic humanitarian  crisis in the Kosovo region.

  

 Massive refugee movements from Kosovo into Albania, 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro have led to 
a disastrous humanitarian situation with no indications that the crisis 
is lessening.

  

 While reports vary, it is estimated over 600,000 people 
— one third of Kosovo 's population - have been displaced. Almost 
a quarter of a million people have fled to Albania; 120,000 have gone 
to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; 35,700 to Montenegro, 
and others have crossed into Bosnia-Hercegovina and Turkey. Extreme 
conditions confront those still fleeing their homes in Kosovo, and the 
hundreds of thousands gathered on the Albanian and Macedonian borders.

  

 There is a large and growing requirement for assistance 
in the areas of food, shelter and sanitation.

  

 Australia will provide a further $4 million to humanitarian 
organisations working in the region, namely the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees ($2.5 million), World Food Programme ($1 million) 
and the International Committee of the Red Cross ($500,000). This is 
in addition to the $2 million contribution 1 announced last week.

  

 This assistance will be targeted at meeting the immediate 
relief needs of refugees and internally displaced persons.

  

 It will be provided through the emergency relief budget 
managed by the Australian Government’s overseas aid agency, AusAID.

  

 Australians wanting to donate to relief efforts for 
the refugees should support the appeals launched by the non-government 
agency of their choice.

  

 I would stress that funding channelled through agencies 
already working in the area is the most effective and fastest way for 
Australians to assist in dealing with this crisis. It is neither practical 
nor sensible to send shipments of goods and supplies from Australia 
when the needs of the refugees can be met faster and cheaper from within 
Europe.
