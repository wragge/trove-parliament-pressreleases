 End to unjust visa will help refugees rebuild lives 

 Thursday, 15 May 2008 

 The Rudd Government’s abolition of the Temporary Protection visa (TPV) regime will  help about 1000 refugees rebuild their lives in Australia.  

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today said the  move honoured a Labor election promise and reaffirmed the Rudd Government‘s  commitment to human rights. 

 Under the unjust regime set up by the previous government, unauthorised arrivals  who were owed protection under Australia’s international obligations were only  eligible for TPVs in the first instance.  

 It meant that refugees had no travel rights, reduced access to refugee settlement  services such as English language programs, employment and income assistance,  and could not be reunited with other family members. 

 From early 2008-09, refugees on TPVs who are currently in Australia will receive a  permanent visa, regardless of their mode of arrival. Provided they meet security and  character requirements, they will be granted permanent residency in Australia and  will not need to have their protection claims reassessed. 

 'It means these refugees will now be afforded the same benefits and entitlements as  holders of a permanent visa,' Senator Evans said.  

 'Many refugees suffered enormously before fleeing to Australia only to face the  punitive treatment under the Howard government’s Temporary Protection visa  regime.' 

 There is also clear evidence that the TPV arrangements did nothing to prevent  unauthorised boat arrivals, with numbers increasing not long after the regime was  introduced. 

 Human rights and refugee advocacy groups have welcomed the scrapping of TPVs  announced in the 2008-09 Budget. 

 'The Temporary Protection Visa policy has created an unjust two-tiered system for  refugees and has caused undue suffering and distress for many people trying to  escape persecution.' - Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. 

 'No one will lament the end of the TPV regime, a clearly failed policy which damaged  the mental health of refugees needing protection and left vulnerable families  separated for years.' - Refugee Council of Australia. 

 'With this change to abolish TPVs, refugees can start to put their past behind them  and build positive futures as permanent members of the Australian community. We  applaud this move by the (Rudd) Government to live up to their promises.' - A Just  Australia.
