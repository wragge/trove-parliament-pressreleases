 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 People smugglers' ascendency growing under Rudd 

 Thursday 8th April 2010 

 The arrival of yet another illegal boat, this time with 99 asylum seekers and four crew on 

 board, shows that people smugglers are continuing to grow in ascendency under the Rudd 

 Government, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow 

 Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 

 “People smugglers are buoyed by Labor’s inaction on changing their magnetic policies which 

 have now seen 105 boats arrive, a constantly full Christmas Island and asylum seekers 

 regularly transferred to the mainland,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Boats are getting bigger, meaning fatter profits for people smugglers who are trading in 

 human misery and are deciding who comes to Australia and the circumstances in which they 

 come,” he said.  

 

 “Kevin Rudd cannot keep rewarding people smugglers by failing to take action and cannot 

 keep shuffling the deck chairs on Christmas Island. 

 

 “Boats are arriving at the highest rate on record even when figures from the UNHCR show 

 global asylum applications did not grow last year and people smugglers can now guarantee 

 an ‘easy’ passage to Australia. 

 

 “Australians are also paying for Labor’s failed border policies. With each additional detainee 

 on Christmas Island costing almost $82,000, this latest boat will cost Australians over $8 

 million. 

 

 “While Kevin Rudd remains in border protection denial, the Coalition has a clear plan to get 

 our borders back under control including the reintroduction of Temporary Protection Visas 

 and a no-compromise position on offshore detention,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 Mr Keenan said: “The Government must reveal exactly how far off Western Australia’s coast 

 this latest boat was intercepted, and where it's 103 passengers will be taken. 

 

 "The Minister's office has said this boat was intercepted "south-west of Cape Leveque" 

 without any other details. 

 

 "South-West of Cape Leveque is Broome, Port Hedland, Karratha - Kimberley tourists most 

 likely spotted the boat before the Government was even aware of its existence. 

 

 "Now that it’s here, and with Christmas Island already over capacity, the Government needs 

 to reveal whether they will be taking these latest arrivals straight to WA's mainland, and if so, 

 to which port,” he said.
