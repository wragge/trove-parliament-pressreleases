 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today that a further 62 asylum seekers on Nauru had received decisions on their asylum claims this week.

 The Minister said 10 Iraqis had received positive decisions while 49 had received negative decisions with the remaining three decisions covering other nationalities.

 "This brings to 385 the total number of decisions handed down on Nauru," the Minister said.

 "Some 700 cases are yet to be determined, however processing of the remaining cases is well advanced and decisions will be handed down as soon as they are available."
