 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 22 September 2014   

 ‘Only a 50% chance of dying? Send them back’,  government says   

 A government bill in the House of Representatives today, that would see refugees only given  protection if they faced more than a 50 per cent chance of torture or death, should not be passed  into law the Australian Greens have said.   

 “This is a reckless, dangerous bill that will put people’s lives at risk,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It is women fleeing violence and abuse, in particular, who will be put at serious risk if this bill is  passed.    

 “The Abbott government is happy to let people live or die by the flip of a coin.”   

 A Senate Committee has tabled a report in the Parliament today, following an inquiry into the bill.   

 “This inquiry saw expert after expert line up to slam the dangerous measures contained within the  bill,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Greens recommend that the government scrap this dangerous bill and get on with assessing  people’s claims and giving protection to those who need it.”
