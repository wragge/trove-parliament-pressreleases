  GOVERNMENT GRANTS ASSIST EFFECTIVE SETTLEMENT 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has announced  details of $14.657 million in funding under the new Community Settlement Services  (CSS) Scheme to help refugees and other migrants quickly and effectively become  contributing members of our community. 

  'While the Government has moved towards full cost recovery in immigration services,  emphasised skilled migration and has reduced reliance on Social Security, there are  still people with language, cultural and other settlement difficulties," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "The services will be provided in a highly accountable manner, to meet needs in areas  such as isolated migrants, the aged , refugee women in difficult situations, and new  arrivals who belong to small, emerging communities." 

  All grants awarded by the previous government expire at the end,of September. 

  The new funding has been awarded on the basis of an organisation's ability to meet a  demonstrated need which is not already, or could not be more suitably addressed by  another organisation. Due to the high level of interest, the Government has been  unable to award funding for about two-thirds of applications . 

  The scheme replaces the former Grant-in-Aid and Migrant Access Projects Scheme and  will cover three funding categories:   " the worker-based awards will allow for the employment of the equivalent of 261  full-time workers; 

   " the major project awards will support a range of initiatives including research into  aspects of settlement in Australia and the development of action plan~ for special  needs groups to access general services and;  the minor project awards provide assistance with the purchase of essential  equipment. 

  Organisations will work under service and funding agreements to ensure appropriate  accountability. All grants are effective for one year from 1 October 1997, although a.  number of these grants might be extended for a further one or two years. 

  "I have already flagged that the Government will demand a high level of accountability  be applied to organisations receiving taxpayer-funded grants, to ensure that  measurable outcomes are achieved," Mr Ruddock said.
