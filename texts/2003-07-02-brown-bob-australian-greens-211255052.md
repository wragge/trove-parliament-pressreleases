 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania    

 

 Vietnamese Should Be Assessed Under Australian Law - Brown   

 The transfer of 36 or so Vietnamese boat people to Christmas Island is the original  One Nation solution, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.    

 “The policy first floated by Pauline Hanson, to remove Christmas Island from the  migration laws, thereby denying asylum seekers access to Australian law, was then  put into practice by Prime Minister Howard and the Australian Labor Party.    

 “Christmas Island has effectively been relegated to a second rate part of Australia,  where some laws apply and others do not.    

 “ Vietnam remains a politically repressive Communist police state. The USA State  Department in March stated:    

 “The [Vietnamese] government's human rights record remained poor, and it continued  to commit serious abuses. Police sometimes beat suspects during arrests, detention,  and interrogation.”    

 These asylum seekers will find they have left one state in which their rights are  abused only to arrive in another, without access to the courts and without access to  proper legal advice.    

 “Meanwhile, millionaires and businessmen can queue-jump to enter Australia as  ‘skilled’ migrants. It’s one law for the rich and another for the poor,” Senator Brown  said.    

 “The slander of the Vietnamese boat people as ‘opportunists’ by the Department of  Immigration has begun before even a preliminary interview.
