 asylum seeker law CRUEL, UNNECESSARY AND UNREASONABLE   

 

 

 I will oppose the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing Cohort) Bill 2016,  which would prevent asylum seekers and refugees who arrive by boat from ever entering  Australia. The Bill is cruel and inhumane, completely unnecessary, and goes way beyond any  reasonable measure to protect Australia’s borders.    

 I will move an amendment to the second reading of the Bill which calls on the Government  to abandon its abhorrent policy on asylum seekers and instead put in place a genuinely  regional solution that is humane, fair and consistent with international obligations. A copy of  my amendment is attached.    

 I will continue to speak out against Australia’s asylum seeker policy including by pursuing  my request for the International Criminal Court to investigate the Australian Government for  crimes against humanity.

 The Parliament of the  Commonwealth of Australia 

 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

 Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional  Processing Cohort) Bill 2016 

 (Amendment to motion for second reading to be moved by Mr Wilkie) 

 That all the words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 

 “the House declines to give the bill a second reading and instead: 

 (1) acknowledges that the global refugee crisis is for Australia a humanitarian  challenge and not a border security problem; 

 (2) notes that Australia’s response to asylum seekers will inevitably require a  genuinely regional solution involving most, if not all south-east Asian  countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, and be approved by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;  

 (3) insists that Australia’s response to asylum seekers be consistent with all of  our international treaty obligations including the Refugee Convention, the  Rome Statute, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and 

 (4) calls on the Government to develop and implement a sophisticated policy  response to this challenge that as far as possible deals with the situation in  source countries, countries of first asylum and transit countries”.
