 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs.  The Hon. I.M. Macphee

 /81 

 24 November 1981

 VISIT OF AUSTRIAN INTERIOR MINISTER i

 i  Australia's commitment to resettle Polish refugees from  Austria was strengthened as a result of discussions between 

 Ministers of the Austrian and Australian Governments in Melbourne  week. â 

 At the invitation of the Australian Minister for Immigration 

 and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, the Austrian Federal Minister 

 for the Interior, Mr Erwin Lane, visited Australia from 22 to  25 November.

 '  Mr Lane pointed to the great burden imposed upon Austria by 

 the inflow of refugees from Poland which by November of this year  had reached 25,000, the total of refugees in Austria amounting to 

 28,000. Austria," by accepting - among others - 2,000 refugees from 

 Indochina, had also become a country of resettlement.

 ,  The Australian Government paid tribute to the unfailing 

 generosity and compassion displayed by Austria in its response to 

 the growing outflow of Poles. The seriousness of the situation and 

 the heavy burden on Austria were evidenced by the fact that its 

 refugee facilities had for some time been swamped by the numbers to 

 the extent that most recent arrivals had to be accommodated privately  at an annual cost to Austria of some $A40 million. No asylum seeker 

 was ever denied a chance to establish a claim to refugee status.

 :  Austria appreciated, as Mr Lane pointed out, the particular

 In response to· Austrian requests, Mr Macphee confirmed that  Australiaâwould increase its intake of Polish refugees from Austria. 

 Mr|Macphee said this would not be at the expense of other refugee 

 programs.  He stressed that clearing the camps in Austria could 

 only be achieved as part of a total approach to the Polish problem,  which included addressing the causes of the outflow at its source.

 It^was with this in mind that the Australian Foreign Minister is in 

 Warjsaw this week to discuss Australian assistance to alleviate 

 Poland's desperate economic plight and food shortages. fr-
