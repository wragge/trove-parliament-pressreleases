 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 23 December 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH THE HON. TED BAILLIEU MLA,   PREMIER OF VICTORIA  MELBOURNE   

 Subjects: Visit to St Mary’s House of Welcome; the government’s failed border protection policies; road  safety; Christmas message.   

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Can I say what a pleasure it is to be here at St Mary’s. The House of Welcome very much is the house of  welcome. I’ve had the opportunity to be here many times before and this fantastic institution reaches out on  a daily basis to help those in need and indeed at Christmas time it is especially a time for all Australians to  reach out and give a hand to somebody who needs it. Obviously, we implore everybody to enjoy Christmas,  to get together with their family and their friends and look after their children and stay safe but this is a  reminder that there are people in Australia, every day, in need of a hand and just like St Mary’s House of  Welcome I urge all Australians, all Victorians in particular, to reach out at Christmas time and give someone  who needs a hand a bit of assistance.   

 I’m pleased to be joined here today by Tony Abbott and Tony in his previous role in the Howard  Government has been very supportive of St Mary’s and I know he’s enjoyed this experience as well and I  might invite Tony to say a few words and then we’ll take some questions.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ted, thanks very much. It’s great to be here in Victoria, it’s great to be here at St Mary’s House of Welcome  and it’s good that the Premier of Victoria and the Federal Opposition Leader are here to assist for a little  while with this important community work. Christmas is a great time but not everyone enjoys Christmas as  much as all of us and look, it’s important that we lend a helping hand wherever we can. I like to think of that  lapidary phrase of Ben Chifley’s - that is, our light on the hill, to lend a helping hand wherever we can - and  so it’s nice to be here with Ted, it’s great to be here with the sisters who’ve been running this house for   50-odd years and I’m pleased to be able to join my fellow Australians here on the eve of the most enjoyable  family time of the year.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, are you prepared to compromise on asylum seekers to help get the deal through?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I want to make a few points. First of all I want to thank the Government for finally putting a specific  proposal in writing. I want to say that I welcome the meeting that will take place in Sydney at 1.30 today  involving Scott Morrison, Chris Bowen and very importantly, Kevin Rudd and Julie Bishop because the  Foreign Minister and the Shadow Foreign Minister should be involved in this.    

 How we handle the boat people crisis does have very significant foreign policy ramifications but most of all  I want to say thank God that at last the Government has finally seen sense and appreciated that Nauru is a  vital part of any serious policy to stop the boats. Now, I regret that it has taken some 14,000 illegal arrivals  and the turning up on our shores of almost 300 boats to bring them to this position but thank God they’ve  come there. The Opposition stands ready to lend every assistance to the Government in reopening Nauru. It  is, in the end, the Government’s job to protect our borders. If you can’t control the borders you can’t govern  the country but where the Government is proposing good policy the Opposition will give them every bit of  support.    

 I just hope that as well as talking to the Opposition today the Government is on the phone to the President of  Nauru because Nauru can be up and running within a few weeks. Before the parliament of Australia comes  back in February, Nauru can be up and running and taking boat people and that would send the strongest  possible signal to the people smugglers that the game is finally up.   

 QUESTION:   

 Can agreement be reached today?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, we will give the Government agreement here, now, to reopen Nauru and if they need any support from  us to reopen Nauru they have got it. We are there with bells on. We have been saying for a decade that to  stop the boats you need offshore processing at Nauru, temporary protection visas - because as long as  there’s permanent residency at the end of the journey the people smugglers will always have a product to  sell - and yes, you’ve got to be prepared to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so because that is the  ultimate assertion of Australian sovereignty over its borders.   

 QUESTION:   

 What about the Malaysia solution?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I think the time for Malaysia has well and truly passed. I don’t think anyone really supports it. Half  the Labor Party, at least, hate it. They absolutely hate it and if you’ve got Nauru you just don’t need  Malaysia.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, your only support for the proposal is the Nauru part?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, it’s now the Government’s policy to reopen Nauru and I say enthusiastically yes, yes, yes to Nauru.  Very enthusiastically, I say yes, yes, yes to Nauru.

 QUESTION:   

 But you oppose the rest of the proposal?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well look, I support good policy. That’s the Opposition’s job: to propose and support good policy. Where  governments propose bad policy, well, I’m afraid they’re on their own. It’s up to the Government to get  support for its policies. We will support those that are good and we won’t support those that are bad.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, while the Malaysia solution’s on the table, there’s no deal?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No, look, we say let’s go ahead with Nauru and let’s do it now. Let’s do Nauru now. Let’s ring up the  President of Nauru and get that centre open and in just a few short weeks the Nauru centre can be open.  Before parliament comes back in February, long before then, Nauru can be taking boat people and once the  boat people are going off to Nauru, well that is the strongest possible signal to the people smugglers that the  game is up.   

 QUESTION:   

 But do you think the Government, though, will agree to Nauru but not Malaysia? I mean, it seems to me that  it won’t work, because where you’re standing at the moment…   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, now they’ve conceded that Nauru is an important part of the solution, surely it’s better to have Nauru  than nothing. They’ve accepted that Nauru is going to be necessary if they’re going to tackle the boat people  crisis, the crisis on our borders. Let’s get cracking with Nauru.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, just to be clear, there are no caveats for your support for Nauru, it won’t depend on…?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We offer unconditional and complete support for Nauru and we will do everything immediately to try to  bring Nauru about.   

 QUESTION:   

 Including supporting Malaysia?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well that’s a totally different issue.   

 QUESTION:   

 It’s all part of the one proposal.   

 4 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No, no, no. The Government has put a three-pronged proposal to us. They’ve ruled out some things that we  think are important like temporary protection visas. We’re ruling out supporting Malaysia but we both agree  that Nauru is important and I say let’s go forward with Nauru that we both support and thank God, after four  long years, after four tragic years for our country, after four tragic years for the families of the boat people  who have died at sea, Nauru is going to open again and we will have the beginnings of strong border  protection policy in our country.   

 QUESTION:   

 How long do you think it will be before, as you say, this will have an impact on boat arrivals?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, the moment the Government is on the phone to the President of Nauru declaring a timetable - and it  should be a matter of just a few short weeks to get the first boat people to Nauru - a very, very strong signal  goes out to the people smugglers that once again Australia is on the road to secure borders.   

 QUESTION:   

 Premier, can I just ask you about the new Road Safety Camera Commissioner? Sorry, the road safety…   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Road Safety Camera Commissioner, you’ve got it right.   

 QUESTION:   

 Tell us about the gentleman who has got the job.   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Former County Court judge Gordon Lewis has undertaken that job and we’re very pleased about that. He’s  got a very good track record in this state and this will be the first Road Safety Camera Commissioner in  Australia and this will give Victorians an opportunity to take any concerns they have about the system to the  commissioner. He will also have an opportunity to keep a watchful eye on the system in his own right and  we think this is an important addition to securing the confidence of Victorian people in our road safety  camera system.   

 QUESTION:   

 That’s a problem, isn’t it, because Victorians are not confident in the system at the moment?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Before the election we said that this was the biggest concern and that there wasn’t confidence in the system  and that’s why we had the Auditor-General undertake his review of the system. He’s come back and given a  very clear indication that the system is working appropriately and the protocols are appropriate. In addition  to that we committed to a camera commissioner and that is now to be delivered and Gordon Lewis, I’m sure  will do a very good job.    

 QUESTION:   

 5 

 

 And what is his first priority?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Well that will be a matter for him but obviously getting the system in shape and getting that office in shape  is his immediate priority, but he can set out an agenda in his own right and of course the Government has  indicated the areas where we think there is an opportunity to do that: to respond to complaints, to examine  the generality of complaints and any concerns about the system. It’s not for the commissioner to intervene in  any individual case, that’s not what he will be doing. But he will be looking at the system and making sure  that there is sustained confidence in the system, which obviously has a lot of interest in this state.   

 QUESTION:   

 Premier, should dishonest drivers be allowed to pay their way out of having demerit points recorded on their  record?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 When you say dishonest drivers?   

 QUESTION:   

 Dishonest speeding drivers who claim not to know who was driving the vehicle be able to then pay an extra  $717 to not have those points recorded?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 As I understand it, this loophole as it has been described has been identified by the department and we have  a review of the Road Safety Act underway at the moment. The Minister has already indicated his enthusiasm  to amend the Act in this regard and he’s looking at the opportunity to bring that forward.   

 QUESTION:   

 How quickly could that happen, to bring this forward…   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Well, I’ll leave the department and the Minister to look at the details of that, but I understand the department  is aware of it and they are looking at these. We have the review of the Road Safety Act going on. We’re  obviously keen to see the Act reviewed and action taken to upgrade it where necessary. If it’s appropriate to  bring that forward then the Minister will consider that.    

 QUESTION:   

 What are your concerns about the loophole and what it might lead to in terms of driver behaviour?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 I think any message that people can take from a system which invites people to nominate a driver who’s  offended and then they can in one way or another obscure that, I think that is a loophole which ought to be  addressed and I don’t think there’s any doubt about that.   

 QUESTION:   

 6 

 

 What do you think about companies or individuals who might use the loophole to continue driving when  they shouldn’t be?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Well, I do make the point that there will be from time to time occasions where people can genuinely not  identify who was driving a vehicle so I don’t want to suggest that there not be a process to handle that  situation but where it’s apparent that no effort has been made to identify a driver then I think that’s a  different thing.   

 QUESTION:   

 And how long has the Department been aware of it? You said they were already aware of it. How long?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 I can’t give you a timeline on that specifically but I know it’s been drawn to the Minister’s attention in the  last few weeks.   

 QUESTION:   

 Will legislation have to change for that loophole to be closed?   

 TED BAILLIEU:   

 Well it depends how it’s handled and that’s why I say the Road Safety Act review is continuing and if  there’s an opportunity to bring forward any changes in advance of that then that’s something the Minister  we’ll look at.   

 QUESTION:   

 Tony Abbott, can we just have your Christmas message to Australians before you leave us?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well look, Christmas is a terrific time of the year for most Australians. It’s a great family time. It’s a time to  remember your friends, your loved ones, everyone who has been a part of your life and who has made your  life what it is. But it is very important at Christmas to remember people who are less fortunate. I think it’s a  marvellous thing that our tradition is full of concern for the less fortunate and here we are at the St Mary’s  House of Welcome which is a living, breathing example of how in our society and our culture and our  Christian tradition, you ought to do whatever you can to lend a helping hand to those who are less fortunate  and I think it’s very important that we remember that at Christmas.   

 Thank you.
