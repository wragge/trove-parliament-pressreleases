 The Australian Parliament passes a great deal of legislation. Much of it does not impact on the  future of our nation. Our fundamental citizenship laws do. This year, the Parliament will be  asked to reverse the longstanding thrust of our approach to citizenship.   

 Since  Australian  citizenship  was  created  in  1949,  and  our  country  began  its  massive   immigration  programme,  successive  governments  have  chosen  an  inclusive  approach  to   citizenship.  Discrimination  against  non-English  speaking  migrants  was  ended;  English-language requirements were eased; residency requirements were reduced and then made equal  for all; discriminatory voting privileges were addressed; dual citizenship was allowed; and all  were  required  to  attend  a  citizenship  ceremony.  The  belief  was  that  if  we  encouraged  and   embraced migrants who wanted to become Australians, we would build a better and stronger  nation.    

 The inclusiveness of our approach to citizenship has been sustained through massive changes  in the racial and cultural composition of our migrant intake. We have sometimes felt anxious  about  the  speed  and  magnitude  of  this  change.  But  Australia  has  held  fast  and  not   compromised its belief in inclusiveness. And we have been vindicated by history. The society  we  have  produced  is  not  perfect.  It  is,  however,  a  society  which  is  arguably  the  most   successful, unified and harmonious multicultural nation in the world.  

 

 Nonetheless,  in  2007,  the  Parliament  will  be  asked  to  reverse  the  historic  direction  of   inclusiveness,  and  Government  and  Opposition  seem  inclined  to  do  so.  Our  current  system   requires applicants to demonstrate a basic knowledge of English and an understanding of the 

 responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. These are assessed at  a compulsory   interview.  What  is  proposed  is  that  these  are  replaced  by  a  more  difficult  and  complex   “formal  citizenship  test”.  New  requirements  will  include  English-language  comprehension   and an understanding of Australian values, institutions, traditions and symbols. These would  be assessed via a computer-based, 30-question, multiple-choice test.   

 Some have described these proposed changes as just “commonsense”. Unfortunately, this is  not  the  case.  What  is  involved  -  even  if  it  is  not  intended  -  is  a  fundamental  political  and   social regression that will erect unreasonable and unnecessary barriers to citizenship that are 

 unprecedented in this country.   

 In the course of the debate, six core reasons have been advanced for changing our citizenship  laws.  I  will  examine  these  six  rationales  in  turn.  But  let  me  first  give  you  a  preview  of  my   conclusions.  The  reasons  for  change  are  not  sustainable.  Their  premises  are  unsound,  their   evidence  is  deficient.  Australia’s  historic  achievements  are  underestimated  and  we  risk   compromising our proven success.   

 

 Reason #1: Increased immigration of people from cultures vastly different from our own   

 We  are  told  that  we  need  a  tougher  citizenship  test  because,  today,  Australia  faces  the   unprecedented challenge posed by migrants coming from cultures far removed from our own  and from the cultures of earlier waves of European migrants.    

 The facts do not support this assertion.   

 There  has  been  a  fundamental  change  in  the  racial  and  cultural  composition  of  our  migrant   intake. It occurred 30 years ago. In the 1960s, 86% of our migrants were European and less  than 5% came from Asia. The demise of the White Australia Policy saw Asian immigration  rise  steadily  throughout  the  1970s to  reach  30%  of  our  total  migrant  intake  in  1980.  Asian   immigration has exceeded European every year since 1984.

 The magnitude of the change from Europe to Asia in the 1980s created a perception that there  was an “Asian immigration crisis”. Some believed that the cultural difference between Asians  and Australia’s traditional migrant source cultures posed fundamental problems for Australia. 

 There  were  calls  to  reduce  the  intake  from  Asia.  Australia  held  its  nerve.  There  was  no   apocalypse.  The  contribution  and  commitment  of  Asian  Australians  were  recognised.  Many   of the key proponents of restricting Asian immigration subsequently accepted they had been  wrong.  Even  in  the  depths  of  those  difficult  days,  however,  no  one  advocated  making  our   citizenship laws more exclusionary.   

 Apart from the shift from European to Asian sources of immigrants, there have been no other  major  changes  in  our  migrant  intake.  The  Middle  Eastern  component  of  our  total  migrant   intake has remained a steady 5% for the last 30 years. Over that same period, the proportion  of  New  Zealanders  has  increased  by  6%.  The  proportion  of  migrants  from  Africa  has  also   increased  by  6%.  This  has  primarily  been  due  to  increased  numbers  from South  Africa  and   Zimbabwe and, over the last decade, 21,000 Sudanese refugees. In the decade following the  fall of Saigon, we took in 100,000 Indochinese, constituting 12% of our total migrant intake.  By contrast, the Sudanese comprised 2.1% of our intake over the last decade.   

 The statistics refute the claim that taking in migrants from cultures far removed from our own  is a new challenge facing Australia. Australia met that challenge 30 years ago when the centre  of  gravity  of  our  migrant  intake  swung  from  Europe  to  Asia  and  stayed  there.  There  have   been  some  difficult  and  ugly  periods:  the  Asian  debate  in  the  1980s,  and  the  Hansonite   outbreak in the following decade. But we have surmounted these challenges,  prospered and  grown stronger. We did so without resorting to new and higher barriers to citizenship. Quite  the opposite, we did so because we maintained our commitment to inclusion.   

 

 Reason #2: The present test is too easy, resulting in citizenship not being valued   

 Under our present system, the granting of citizenship is likened to scattering confetti. The test  is  said  to  be  too  easy.  “Many  people”  are  described  as  taking  out  citizenship  without   commitment,  just  for  the  sake  of  a  passport,  and  without  understanding  the  pledge  they  are  

 making. 

 These are significant charges. The only basis for them is a single, unsourced assertion that at  one citizenship ceremony a number of people left before the national anthem was sung. It is  difficult to imagine a flimsier basis on which to launch a major reversal of a policy direction  that has stood the test of time for almost 60 years.  

 Is  there  any  evidence  from  the  hundreds  of  MPs  of  all  political  persuasions  who  attend   citizenship ceremonies that they doubt the sincerity of the people who take the pledge? There  is not. The testimony  of MPs, consistently  stated on the public record, is that people taking  the citizenship pledge do so genuinely, enthusiastically, and after reflection. Why should this  be outweighed by a single anecdote? 

 I think that we all recognise that no test can absolutely  demonstrate a person’s motives and  commitments.  But  if  it  is  true  that  the  present  test  allows  people  to  take  out  citizenship   because it is easy - just for an Australian passport - one would not expect large numbers of  people not to take up the opportunity. In fact, that is precisely what happens. Almost a million  permanent Australian residents choose not to become  citizens,  despite  the fact that they  are  eligible  to  do  so,  and  that  they  could  readily  pass  the  current  test.  Over  half  of  them  have   English  as  their  native  language.  Despite  being  bombarded  by  massive  government  multi-media advertising campaigns seeking to entice them to become citizens, they do not choose to  do  so.  That  is  entirely  their  right.  Their  contribution  to  Australia  is  indisputable,  and  their  

 

   Page 4 of 9

 reasons for not becoming citizens are no doubt complex. But they do disprove the assertion  that people become citizens just for a passport.  

 If  it  is  true  that  citizenship  is  scattered  around  like  confetti,  acceptance  of  those  who  apply   should  be  a  mere  formality.  It  is  not.  Applicants  have  to  be  independently  assessed  to   determine  whether  they  are  of  good  character,  have  basic  English,  and  understand  the   responsibilities  of  citizenship.  On  average,  over  three  and  a  half  thousand  applicants  a  year   are refused citizenship because they do not meet the requirements. 

 These,  however,  are  just  fragments  of  evidence.  A  demonstration  of  what  has  been  in  the   hearts and minds of the three and a half million people who have become citizens since 1949  can be found in our history. Many of them could not have passed the “formal citizenship test”  that is being proposed. But it is unquestionable that they committed to Australia. They have  enriched every  facet of our nation’s life. They have worked hard and obeyed the law. They  have  defended  Australia.  They  have  been  good  parents  and  fine  neighbours.  Our  present   citizenship  system  has  overwhelmingly  given  Australia  good  citizens.  How  can  we  say,   against the weight of our history, that they took citizenship out just because it was easy?   

 

 Reason #3: A real incentive to learn English   

 It is said that imposing a tougher English-language test is necessary because it will provide a  “real incentive” for migrants to learn English.   

 Before going further, one thing needs to be made crystal clear. There is already a requirement  that applicants for citizenship must have a basic knowledge of English. This is enshrined in  the Citizenship Act, and is tested at a compulsory interview. The so-called “formal citizenship  test” does not establish a test where none existed before. What it does is significantly increase  the barriers to becoming a citizen.   

 I  absolutely  believe  that  it  is  of  the  utmost  importance  that  people  are  encouraged  and   supported to learn English: it benefits them, their families, and the community. English as the  national  language  and  the  promotion  of  its  acquisition  have  always  been  central  tenets  of  

 Australian multiculturalism. The community consensus, shared by both migrants and native-born, is that English is important for citizenship. And the greater the proficiency in English,  the greater one’s ability to take advantage of the opportunities that Australia has to offer.   

 The concern I have about this aspect of the proposal is that it assumes - without evidence -  that  many  migrants  are  unmotivated  or  resistant  to  learning  English  and  that  the  threat  of   denial of citizenship is an appropriate and effective spur to get them to study harder. 

 

 This profoundly misunderstands the migrant experience. Migrants do recognise the centrality  of  English  in  Australian  society.  Migrants  of  a  non-English  speaking  background  do  grasp   that limited English proficiency blocks many paths in our society.   

 Before using the stick of the denial of citizenship to penalise people, it is incumbent upon us  to  establish  the  nature  and  extent  of  limits  on  English-language  fluency.  Do  certain   immigrants not want to learn, or are they stymied by the lack of availability of classes? Are  they  fully  occupied  in  meeting  other  demands,  such  as  employment  and  family   responsibilities? Are there simply limits on how much English some people can learn? 

 

 Beyond this, however, the assumption that the new test will provide a real incentive to learn  English  founders  on  the  facts  of  illiteracy  in  Australia.  Under  the  new,  proposed,  “formal”   citizenship  requirements,  applicants  will  “first  need  to  have  successfully  completed  a  test,   designed to demonstrate their knowledge of the English language”. This will be assessed via a 

 

   Page 5 of 9

 30-question,  multiple-choice,  computer-based  test.  To  answer  the  questions,  applicants  will   need to study a detailed handbook.   

 This  test  represents  a  fundamental  shift  away  from  our  current  focus  on  basic  English   speaking ability  to a test of literacy: the ability  to read, comprehend and respond to written  English.   

 The clear fact is that thousands of people would fail such a test, even when English is their  native language. Scientific studies conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that  two and a half million Australians have very poor literacy skills. They have great difficulties  in using many of the printed materials that are encountered in everyday life. One and a half  million  people  who  have  English  as  their  native  language  fall  into  this  low  skill  category.  

 These  people  for  instance  cannot  “locate  information  on  a  medicine  label  giving  the   maximum number of days the medicine should be taken”. They cannot “enter the number of  theatre  tickets  required  on  an  order  form”.  Recently  it  has  been  indicated  that  alternative   testing  arrangements  will  be  made  for  people  with  low  literacy  skills  and  that  this  would   involve only a few people. The ABS data show that this is optimistic in the extreme.   

 The native-born do not have to pass any tests to be citizens. That is as it should be. But for a  test of citizenship to be a real incentive for migrants to learn English, it cannot demand a level  of  proficiency  that  is  beyond  the  reach  of  a  significant  number  of  Australians  who  have   English as their mother tongue. Rather than an incentive to learn English, the new test will be  a  punishment  for  those  with  low  literacy  who  happen  to  be  born  overseas.  It  will  fail  to   achieve its ostensible objectives and it is totally inconsistent with Australia’s commitment to  equal treatment and a fair go. 

 

 

 Reason #4: We should follow other countries   

 Proponents  of  the  test  argue  that  we  should  follow  the  UK,  Canada,  the  US  and  the   Netherlands - countries that are “well ahead” in introducing a “formal” citizenship test.   

 But no evidence has been provided that the tests in these countries have been effective. The  British  test,  which  is  the  preferred  model,  was  introduced  just  over  one  year  ago.  It  is   certainly too soon to assess its long-term impact.   

 Moreover,  why  do  we  feel  that  we  have  to  follow  other  countries?  Australia  has  an   unsurpassed  record  of  multicultural  harmony  and  integration.  Why  should  we  abandon  our   history  and  experience  and  seek  to  mimic  countries  with  less  distinguished  achievements?   There  is  no  reason  to  be  culturally  submissive  to  other  nations.  We  long  ago  got  over  our   cultural cringe. We should not revert to it in an area where our achievements make Australia  worthy of emulation by others. 

 

 

 Reason #5: There is overwhelming public support for the proposed test   

 Proponents of the new test claim that opinion polls and responses to a government discussion  paper show overwhelming support for the test.   

 The evidence does not bear this out.   

 Two opinion polls are cited to demonstrate public support for the new test.    

 The  first  is  a  Newspoll  survey  which  asked,  ‘Are  you  in  favour  or  against  knowledge  of   English  being  a  requirement  for  becoming  an  Australian  citizen?’  A  great  majority  were  in  

 

   Page 6 of 9

 favour.  Knowledge  of  English,  however,  is  currently  a  requirement  for  becoming  a  citizen.   Why  this  should  not  be  seen  as  an  endorsement  of  the  current  arrangements  is  beyond  me.   The second is a Daily Telegraph telephone poll. There was strong support for the proposition  that  migrants  should  have  a  good  understanding  of  English  before  becoming  citizens.   However only 395 people phoned in.   

 There  was  a  third  poll  of  3,196  respondents  that  was  somehow  overlooked.  That  was  an   internet  poll  conducted  by  The  Age  asking  whether  people  supported  the  introduction  of  a   citizenship test - 65% did not.   

 Regarding the responses to the Discussion Paper, these have been described as demonstrating  strong,  overwhelming  community  support  for  a  “formal”  citizenship  test  of  English  and  an   understanding  of  national  “values,  institutions  and  traditions”.  This  is  not  borne  out  by  an   examination of the responses.  

 

 There  were  over  1,600  responses  to  the  Discussion  Paper.  Only  116  were  made  publicly   available. Of these, 75% opposed the new test. Those in opposition included all the state and  territory governments that made a submission, 13 of 15 local governments, and the majority  of church groups, ethnic organisations, legal bodies and civil liberties associations. The key   reasons advanced for this opposition included: a lack of evidence to justify the change, that  current  processes  worked  well,  that  new  migrants  already  have  a  strong  desire  to  learn   English and integrate, that they would suffer from a more punitive approach, and that further  marginalisation and discrimination would occur.    

 None of the almost 1500 individual submissions were published on the grounds of “protecting  people’s  privacy”  but  a  statistical  summary  was  provided  by  DIMA.  The  results  are  as   follows. 

 

 The  only  question  on  which  a  majority  agreed  was  whether  Australia  should  introduce  a   formal citizenship test. As there is already a test in place, the conclusions one draws from this  are quite unclear.   

 When we turn to the other elements of the test there was absolutely no agreement at all. Of  the  remaining  15  questions,  five  were  grouped  under  the  heading  “the  content  of  the  test”.   They covered issues including the need for a formal test of the level of English competence,  and extending the current requirements to a broad knowledge of Australia including history  and  symbols.  The  summary  reported  that  none  of  the  responses  to  these  questions  could  be   analysed in a statistically significant way.    

 An  examination  of  the  responses  to  the  other  ten  questions,  covering  such  issues  as  the   importance of knowledge of Australia and the level of English required, shows a staggering  average non-response rate of 77%.    

 With  respect  to  the  outcomes  of  the  face-to-face  consultations  attended  by  129  invitees,   DIMA  noted  that  there  was  both  support  and  opposition  to  the  test.  It  did  not  feel  that  this   should be reported “simply in raw numbers for or against the test”, and did not provide any  numbers at all.   

 One could think of a number of ways to describe the results of the responses to the Discussion  Paper. Overwhelming community support is certainly not one of them.

 Reason #6: It will reassure the Australian people    

 The  final  rationale  advanced  for  the  new  test  is  that  Australians  feel  insecure  and  that  their   identity  is  threatened.  A  tougher  citizenship  test  that  requires  affirmation  of  a  shared   Australian  identity  and  values  will  apparently  reassure  them.  As  with  the  other  rationales   examined above, this one is similarly unsubstantiated.    

 Australians  are  undoubtedly  disturbed  by  the  threat  of  terrorism  and  by  the  pace  of  global   change. It is, however, a gargantuan leap from these concerns to the assertion that there is a  widespread belief in the community that our identity is under threat and that the proposed new  test would be a reasonable and effective way to allay community concerns.    

 Can we reassure Australians by imposing a uniform identity on people who want to become  citizens? Many of us have a notion of what an Australian identity is. The problem is that our  concepts  are  not  necessarily  the  same.  The  specifics  of  any  elaborated  Australian  identity   have been endlessly contested.    

 A number of  my  colleagues have chanced their arms on what it means to be an Australian.   One  has  signalled  that  knowledge  of  cricket  might  be  an  important  element.  A  second  has   indicated that strong, physical infrastructure is a fundamental value. A third has put forward  Simpson  (and  his  donkey)  as  “everything  that  is  at  the  heart  of  what  it  means  to  be   Australian”. 

 

 I have to say that Simpson was one of my  childhood heroes. He was lauded in the Readers  imposed on primary school pupils by the Victorian State Education system. He was, however,  an Englishman who arrived in Australia as an illegal boatperson, having jumped ship in 1910.  He was a republican at the apogee of the British Empire. He was a staunch trade unionist and  an advocate for an English workers’ revolution.    

 Such  are  the  pitfalls  of  defining  what  it  means  to  be  an  Australian.  We  cannot  wish  these   complexities  away.  We  need  to  recognise  that  definitions  of  national  identity  and  national   values  are  not  fixed  but  are  constantly  in  flux.  Indeed,  they  can  sometimes  change  at   breakneck speed.   

 Let me exemplify. The questions for the proposed new citizenship test would be drawn from  “Let’s  Participate:  A  Course  in  Australian  Citizenship”.  “Let’s  Participate”  enshrines   multiculturalism,  encouraging  the  use  of  community  languages,  expressing  diverse  cultural   beliefs, and rejecting discrimination on the basis of culture. It emphasises that the acceptance  of diversity is a vital part of what being an Australian means. I personally endorse all of this  wholeheartedly and have always done so.   

 The  problem  is  that  just  a  few  weeks  ago  multiculturalism  was  banished  from  the  national   political  lexicon  because  it  means  different  things  to  different  people.  Okay,  some  people   don’t  like  the  term  multiculturalism.  But  what  about  the  basic  theme  of  diversity?  The   Preamble  to  the  Australian  Citizenship  Act  1948  has  this  as  one  of  its  tenets:  “Australian   citizenship  is  a  common  bond,  involving  reciprocal  rights  and  obligations,  uniting  all   Australians  while  respecting  their  diversity”.  Unfortunately,  the  new  values  to  which   applicants for citizenship will have to subscribe pointedly omit any reference to the value of  diversity that was, just a few short months ago, a pillar of our citizenship.   

 I do not believe we can reassure people about Australia’s identity by turning our back on our  historic achievements. One of these is an inclusive citizenship policy. Another is a belief that  we need to respect our cultural diversity and recognise that it has enriched and strengthened  our  nation.  The  fact  is  that,  whatever  politicians  say,  Australians  overwhelmingly  support   multiculturalism - even if they might interpret it differently. In any event, more Australians 

 

   Page 8 of 9

 put tolerance of different religions and cultures at the top of their list of the most important  Australian values, well ahead of mateship.   

 Toughening the laws on citizenship and excluding migrants who want to commit to Australia  but who cannot jump the higher hurdle of a literacy test may reassure some people, projecting  images  of  unity  and  conformity.  I  do  not  believe  we  should  make  it  harder  for  people  to   become  citizens  in  order  to  project  an  illusory  reassurance.  Moreover,  to  do  so  would   flagrantly  contradict  the  spirit  of  fair  play,  one  of  the  values  the  new  test  is  supposed  to   engender in new citizens.   

 The  anxieties  caused  by  the  pace  of  change,  the  impact  of  globalization,  and  the  threat  of   terrorism  are  real  and  substantial.  The  way  to  reassure  people  is  not  to  inflate  their  anxiety   with  flawed  evidence  and  defective  public  policy.  The  way  to  reassure  people  is  to  reflect   accurately what we have achieved through our inclusive citizenship policies and our embrace  of  cultural  diversity.  Our  nation  has  a  greater  proportion  of  overseas  born  than  any  of  the   countries  that  the  proponents  of  the  new  test  want  us  to  emulate.  And,  we  have  made  an   enormous success out of this. We have created an admirable, decent and harmonious country.  Our success is demonstrable. Our success has been based on the embrace of new citizens, not  their exclusion. On respect for cultural diversity, not its dismissal.    

 

 Conclusion   

 Let there be no misapprehension about the impact of the proposed new test: it will stop many  immigrants who are committed to Australia as their home from becoming citizens and thereby  full members of our community.   

 The plain fact is that hundreds of thousands of native-born and immigrant Australians would  not be able to pass the test.    

 Low literacy skills should not make a new migrant unworthy of citizenship, just as it does not  and  should  not  debar  the  native-born  from  the  right  to  fully  participate  in  the  life  of  the   nation.   

 Applying  a  harsh  new  test  for  citizenship  would  diminish  Australia’s  real  strength  and   cohesion.   

 A  letter  published  in  The  Age  reflects  the  experience  and  the  sentiment  of  hundreds  of   thousands of migrants to this country. The author wrote:   

 Older  migrants  were  not  subjected  to  an  English-language  test  and,  in  many   instances, they never did master the language of their new country. Finding work,  establishing  a  home  and  family  and  ensuring  a  secure  future  for  their  children   took all their energy and resolve. They did not underestimate the importance of  developing knowledge of English and there was a sense of regret and sometimes  despair  that  they  needed  to  rely  on  others  to  ease  their  way  in  an  English-speaking environment….they were, however, model Australian citizens and their  loyalty to this country was rock solid [Nina Mills, Blairgowrie].   

 Since Australian citizenship was created, many hundreds of thousands have been accepted as  citizens,  despite  having  only  basic  English  proficiency.  They  have  made  enormous  and   universally acknowledged contributions to their new nation. How can it be in the interest of  cohesion  and  integration  to  impose  new  barriers  to  citizenship,  barriers  that  would  have   prevented its acquisition by so many Australians who have proven to be model citizens?   

 

   Page 9 of 9

 Would being refused access to citizenship have increased their commitment and identification  with Australia? Would it have accelerated their integration in our society? Would it have built  their confidence in interaction with others? Would governments have responded to their needs  despite  the  fact  that  they  were  denied  the  vote?  Would  they  have  won  the  respect  of  other   Australians if they had been permanently relegated to the position of guest workers? The only 

 rational answer is no.   

 Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  believe  that  we  need  to  constantly  seek  to  improve  the  English-language skills of our immigrants and to maximise their opportunities in our society. But in  order  to  do  this  we  need  a  robust  analysis  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  English-language   difficulties  and  how  these  can  be  overcome.  Similarly,  where  there  are  barriers  to  migrants   being able to participate effectively in Australian society we need to define them and establish  how they can best be dismantled. 

 

 The  usual  processes  of  departmental  advice  have  not  served  us  well  in  this  regard,  perhaps   understandably given the Department of Immigration’s preoccupations in other areas. There  is, however, a model that has proven its worth in the past. That is the Galbally Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services for Migrants established by Malcolm Fraser, which reported  three decades ago. This review had a seminal impact on our society and its ability to respond  effectively to Australia’s cultural and ethnic diversity. 

 

 I believe that there would be strong support for the Government to establish a small group of  knowledgeable  and  experienced  people  who  command  the  confidence  of  the  general   community  to  investigate  the  impediments  to  English-language  acquisition  and  to  effective  

 integration  and  make  recommendations  on  the  measures  and  resources  necessary  to  address   them. I would commend this course of action.   

 Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Australia’s citizenship laws have been made progressively  more  inclusive  has  provided  a  basis  of  trust,  confidence  and  achievement.  The  fact  that  we   accepted  people  with  modest  English  as  citizens  has  broken  down  barriers,  not  maintained   them.  The  establishment  of  a  new  test  that  would  exclude  people  who  are  committed  to   Australia and could pass the present test will create barriers, restrict opportunities, and impede  participation.  It  would  not  be  apparent  immediately  but  it  would  happen,  and  it  would   diminish Australia.
