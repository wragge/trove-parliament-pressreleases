 Govt Turns Its Back On Asylum-Seeker Reform 

 Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young  

 Monday 19th April 2010, 4:30pm 

 The re-opening of the notorious Curtin Detention Centre shows the Federal Government has 

 abandoned its promises to provide real reform of Australian asylum-seeker policy, according 

 to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. 

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, says the 

 announcements of recent days from the Rudd Government represent a clear policy backflip. 

 "In Opposition, Labor vowed to move away from the dark days of indefinite detention, and 

 the detention of children,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "However, everything the Government has done recently, from the suspension of asylum 

 claims by Sri Lankans and Afghanis, to the re-opening of a notorious desert prison in the 

 Curtin Detention Centre goes against all of Australia's international obligations. 

 "The only difference between the Rudd Government and the Howard Government is that 

 Kevin Rudd promised to improve the treatment of asylum-seekers - but now he is re-implementing some of the worst parts of the Howard government's regime.'' 

 The Greens have always advocated moving asylum-seekers to the mainland from Christmas 

 Island so they can be processed quickly, fairly and humanely, but the Greens do not believe 

 that the Curtin centre is the right alternative. 

 "This is about transparency and it's about trust - we need to know how long the Government 

 has been planning this policy U-turn on Curtin, and how much it is really going to cost,'' 

 Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "Housing asylum-seekers in desert prisons is not fair, practical or humane. 

 "Asylum-seekers who have escaped torture or trauma need access to services - and a 

 desert prison 2000km from Perth is not the best place to provide those services.'' 

 Senator Hanson-Young said she would seek access to the Curtin centre to check conditions, 

 and would also try to visit the Darwin detention centre and the residential housing area at 

 Port Augusta, where unaccompanied minors will be sent.
