 113 Afghans Return Home from Nauru

 MPS 099/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, confirmed today the first large-scale return of Afghan asylum seekers from Nauru to Kabul.

 A group of 113 people, including 110 men, 1 woman and 2 children, were being flown into Kabul on a charter flight arranged by the International Organization for Migration.

 All members of the group took advantage of the reintegration assistance package from the Australian Government which includes cash assistance of $AUD2000 per individual adult or child or up to $AUD10,000 for a family unit comprising husband, wife and dependent children.

 "The package offered by the government will enable these people to return home in an environment of safety and dignity to help in the rebuilding of Afghanistan," Mr Ruddock said

 "Forty-two Afghans had returned home from Nauru earlier this year, but this is the first large-scale return from the offshore processing centres.

 "On arrival in Kabul the group was scheduled to be transferred to a local hotel for a briefing with arrangements for access to a range of support services or to make travel arrangements to return to their home towns and villages.

 "The group will also be able to access the Jangaluk Reintegration and Vocational Training Centre - a centre funded by the Australian Government -when it opens shortly.

 "This centre will provide residential facilities from which Afghans returning home will be able to access a range of support and training services."

 Of the 549 Afghans remaining on Nauru, another 318 had accepted the reintegration package and arrangements were being made for their return home.
