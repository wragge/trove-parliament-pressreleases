 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Wednesday 13 May 2015    

 

 BUDGET DOES NOTHING TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIA’S GLOBAL REPUTATION ON IMMIGRATION    

 “The Abbott Government’s significant cuts in foreign aid are short sighted and self-serving and  will further damage Australia’s poor global reputation on immigration” Greens spokesperson on  Immigration Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has said.    

 “With effectively no cuts to aid in Nauru, PNG and Cambodia the government is blatantly paying  off these nations to do Australia’s dirty work on asylum seeker detention.    

 “The Australian Government spends 400 million dollars keeping women and children under  horrific conditions in detention camps in Nauru rather than taking a regional leadership role in  the resettlement of refugees.    

 “Significant cuts in aid to Afghanistan a source country for refugees, is both irresponsible and  morally corrupt.    

 “Millions of dollars has been slashed from our closest neighbour Indonesia, including a 40  million dollar cut to the International Organisation for Migration. This will lead to dire  consequences for the thousands of displaced persons in country and will dramatically affect   Australia’s relationships with its neighbour.    

 “Cuts in aid, continued short sighted and self-serving policies in the resettlement of refugees,  the funding of other countries to provide inadequate offshore detention and arrogantly shirking  our global responsibilities, as the world experiences it’s largest global displacement of people in  65 years, are all hallmarks of the current Australian Government.
