 Government delivers $17.6 million increase for  Adult Migrant English Program

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has announced a $17.6  million increase in funding for English language training through the Adult Migrant English Program  (A M E PI for newly-arrived migrants and refugees.

 "This is in keeping with the Government's recognition that functional English is the key to successful  settlement," M r Ruddock said.

 The $17.6 million additional funding will be spread over four years and start from 1 July 1997.

 "Once again the Government has delivered on election commitments," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister said this funding is in addition to current funding o f the AMEP which will receive $76.3  million in 1996-97.

 "The Government will also improve the flexibility and effectiveness o f the AMEP by introducing new  service delivery arrangements from 1997-98 onwards," Mr Ruddock said.

 "One o f the new arrangements being introduced to make English services more flexible is competitive  purchasing, using public tendering. This will help to ensure we obtain value for money.

 "Consequently, learning opportunities will be o f better quality and more responsive to the needs o f  newly-arrived migrants and refugees. There will be wider availability o f classes after hours, in  community centres and extended distance learning, including delivery through television and other  multi-media.

 "The arrangements will be developed following consultations with migrants and refugees using  English language programs, service providers, State and Territory governments and the wider  community," he said.
