 ABBOTT’S NEGATIVITY PUTTING LIVES AT RISK   

 Another asylum seeker boat was intercepted overnight, the 34th since Tony Abbott chose  negativity and his personal political interest over the national interest, rejecting the  Governmentâs offer to implement offshore processing.    

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said with more boats arriving, more lives were being put at risk at  sea on leaky vessels.   

 “This Government has been very clear, we want to put in place a deterrent to prevent  people from getting on those dangerous boats - something offshore processing and the  Malaysia Arrangement can deliver,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “To stop the flow of boats and stop lives being put at risk we even offered to implement  Tony Abbottâs own policy of a processing centre on Nauru - but Mr Abbottâs political  calculation is that more boats are in his best interests.   

 “When will this relentless negativity come to an end?”   

 Mr Clare said it was time for Mr Abbott to vote to allow offshore processing.    

 “I urge Mr Abbott to remember what this is all about - 200 people died last year off the  coast of Indonesia and another 11 people died off the Malaysian coast in February,” Mr  Clare said.   

 “We can stop this happening, but it requires legislation. That means it requires us to work  together to pass it through the Parliament.   

 “If Mr Abbott really wants to âstop the boatsâ he must stop saying ânoâ and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
