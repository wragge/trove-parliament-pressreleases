 PETER DUTTON FAILS TO ENSURE MEDICAL TREATMENT IN NAURU    

 Peter Dutton has serious questions to answer about new reports asylum seekers  and refugees in Nauru have had medical treatment and transfers delayed by  bureaucrats, including patients with breast lumps, kidney stones and neurological  damage.    

 These are serious allegations that cannot go unanswered.    

 Peter Dutton cannot continue to bury his head in the sand and ignore two  recommendations about medical treatment and transfer processes from the Labor- initiated Senate Inquiry into serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of  asylum seekers on Nauru and like-minded allegations on Manus Island.    

 The Senate Inquiry recommended:    

 Recommendation 1: The committee recommends that the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection, as a matter of urgency, commission an  external review of its medical transfer procedures in offshore processing  centres. 

  Recommendation 2: The committee recommends that the Australian  Government undertake to seek advice in relation to whether improvements  are required to the medical treatment options available to asylum seekers and  refugees in the Republic of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, particularly mental  health services.    

 Peter Dutton needs to explain why he is still ignoring the Senate Inquiry  recommendations and neglecting his responsibility to appoint a new Chief Medical  Officer and Surgeon General.    

 Thousands of people across Australia’s onshore and offshore immigration network  are still without an advocate to ensure medical care is based on the best medical  advice following the resignation of the Immigration Department’s Chief Medical  Officer and Surgeon General in September.    

 Labor wrote to Peter Dutton in August seeking an assurance that medical transfers  for people living in Australian-funded offshore regional processing centres would be  available when required and recommended by medical experts.    

 The chaos and dysfunction of Peter Dutton’s incompetent management of offshore  processing arrangements cannot continue.     

 Malcolm Turnbull must immediately guarantee access to medical treatment for  asylum seekers and refugees will not suffer as a result of Peter Dutton’s continued  failure to manage his portfolio.
