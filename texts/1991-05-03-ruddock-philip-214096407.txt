 MIDDLE EASTERN REFUGEES

 3 May 1991

 News reports that the Government may have intended to  provide 14,000 refugee places for Middle Easterners were slammed  by Departmental advisers as untrue and alarmist.

 It is clear that there was some truth in suggestions that  the number of refugee places for Middle Easterners was being  reviewed.

 Whilst it was never publicly announced in detail, the  Minister has now informed the Parliament, in answer to a Question  on Notice from me, that an extra 1,519 places were found for this  year in the 1990/91 program.

 Attached is a copy of the Minister's reply. It is a pity  that this basic information about refugee and humanitarian entry  arrangements has to be sought through Pari lament airy scrutiny  rather than regular announcement.

 (Question No 6 5 6  )

 Mr Ruddock asked the Minister for Immigration, Local  Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 14 March 1991

 Have additional places in Australia's immigration  program been reserved for refugees and applicants on  humanitarian grounds from the Middle East since the  Gulf crisis; if so, how many.

 Mr Hand - The answer to the honourable member's question is  as follows:

 I, 320 places were initially allocated early in 1990/91  to the Middle Eastern component of the Refugee and  Humanitarian Program. Overall, the Program was set at II, 000 places, including a contingency reserve of 1,000  places.

 In response to changing requirements for refugee and  humanitarian places in late 1990/early 1991, I adjusted  the allocations for individual regional programs and  activated the contingency reserve.

 The Middle Eastern component of the Program now stands  at 2,839 places. As a result, it is now the second  highest component after Indochina. It provides for  people from a range of countries and situations in the  region, including needs which may emerge as a result of 

 the crisis in the Gulf, within the overall numbers,  flexibility will be maintained to respond to changing  needs and priorities arising from the unpredictable  nature of political events which give rise to refugee 

 movements.
