 Faster Processing for Protection Visas

 The Department of Immigration has significantly improved its processing of protection visa (PV) applications.

 Having cleared an unhealthy build up, not of primary protection visa applications but of applications for further protection visas, the department  has been able to substantially improve its performance and process new PV applications more quickly.

 The first report by DIMA on Protection Visa Processing Taking More Than 90 Days for the Reporting Period 1 July 2005 to 31 October 2005, was  tabled in Parliament today. 

 The report focuses on 3213 applications, the majority of which were for further protection, that were finalised within the reporting period. 3144 of  these were already on hand when the Government announced a 90-day limit for finalising applications. 

 Clearing this build up has been a tremendous achievement because in 98 per cent of these cases, the 90 day period had already completely or  partially elapsed when the new arrangements setting the 90 day standard were announced in mid June 2005.

 Having cleared this unhealthy build up the department has now been able to speed up processing for new applications.

 Of 1100 new protection visa applications received between 1 July, 2005 and mid-January 2006, 95 per cent were finalised within 90 days. The  remaining 5 per cent were held up by factors outside DIMA’s control.

 Processing visa protection claims is an important part of DIMA’s work. For example, there have been more than 5000 protection claims finalised  since June 2005 to date, including initial applications, applications for further protection and those remitted to the department from the Refugee  Review Tribunal.

 Completing processing in a timely manner is obviously beneficial to the applicant and in line with the Government’s commitment. I am pleased  that my department has been able to clear the build up and get on with the job of processing PV applications quickly.
