 REFUGEE TALKS IN DJAKARTA

 The Australian Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart W est,  has met senior members of the.Indonesian  Government in Djakarta to discuss the Indo-Chinese refugee  situation. Mr West met Dr Mochtar (Foreign Minister), Maj.  Gen. Subjakto, (Governor of the Institute for National 

 Defence),  officials of the Refugee Task Force and the-  Ministry of Justice.

 Mr West told the Indonesian Government that Australia would  continue with a steady response by allocating at least 50%  of its total 1983/84 refugee intake to Indo-Chinese refugees  and that further,  up to 50% of this Indo-Chinese intake would  be from Indonesia and Malaysia. He said Australia regarded 

 this policy as being of prime importance to relations with  Indonesia and other ASEAN nations. Mr West said that since  1975 Australia had accepted approximately 12,000 refugees 

 from Indonesia or about 16% of all refugees resettled from  Indonesia. In the last year Australia had accepted about  1,800 or about half of those resettled from Indonesia.  He . .   said whilst this suggested that Australia was accepting an  increasing proportion of refugees resettled from Indonesia,   it was most desirable that the response to resettlement of 

 refugees from Indonesia should.be spread as widely as possible  internationally. .

 Mr West notes substantial agreement between Dr Mochtar and  other Indonesian Government officials on the following  matters:

 - that it was necessary to continue with the humanitarian ,   policies of first refuge;

 - that a steady rate of resettlement by major nations  would be continued and efforts made to further  internationalise the response;

 - that possibilities of repatriation should be further explored recognising that this was currently more  capable of implementation in Thailand regarding ' Kampuchea and Laos than Indo-Chinese boat people from  Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

 Mr West said that there ..were common objectives and a mutual  interest between Indonesia and Australia in ensuring a  continuing international response by resettlement and to .   take steps designed to reduce the outflow of refugees. Only  thus will there ·  be a durable solution to:,the Indo-Chinese —  refugee problem. .  '  .  *

 Mr West is visiting South East Asia after attending inter­ governmental consultations with some of the major- resettlement/  donor nations,  (United-  States,  Canada and Japan)-  in Honolulu  last wee k .  He said that whilst the Honolulu .talks had been 

 proposed after his decision to visit Indonesia the talks were  extremely useful in directing attention to the need for  overall international strategies aimed at solving the  Indo-Chinese refugee problem. The Honolulu meeting produced  general consensus on the need for a steady intake of 

 Indo-Chinese refugees from nations of first refuge and that  further attempts would be made to increase the international  response through UNHCR assessments and planning.
