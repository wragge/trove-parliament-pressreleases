 Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services 

 Media Release 

 Supporting playgroups for children and families 

 24/03/2010 

 Joint Media Release with  The Hon Jenny Macklin MP, Minister for  Families Housing Community Services and Indigenous Affairs 

 The World's Biggest Playgroup Day is a time to celebrate playgroups and  increase awareness of their work in communities across Australia.    

 The Rudd Government is providing $1.2 million to Playgroups Australia to  deliver 96 supported playgroups over two years for families with children  across the country.  

 

 The Government values the enormous contribution made by playgroups to  delivering support and education to Australian families in a relaxed and  friendly environment.    

 They help develop children's social, emotional, physical and cognitive  abilities and provide opportunities for parents and caregivers to establish  social and support networks to assist them in parenting.    

 The 96 playgroups are in addition to our commitments under the Helping  Children with Autism Package and our Indigenous closing the gap agenda.   

 The Government is providing $14.6 million to 2011 for 52 Indigenous-specific supported playgroups in remote, regional and urban communities  and an additional 7 supported playgroups for vulnerable families.  

 

 We are also delivering 150 PlayConnect playgroups by 2012 for children  with autism spectrum disorders.    

 Supported playgroups also provide support to vulnerable families, such as  those from different cultural backgrounds, refugees, Indigenous families,  teenage and young parents, grandparent carers and carers of children with  disability.    

 A trained worker runs play based activities with the children and supports

 parents and other carers including encouraging families to access other  appropriate community services and activities.    

 The Government also contributes ongoing funding of up to $3.5 million each  year to state and territory playgroup associations to support community  playgroups with advice and resources.  

 

 We recognise the important role of play in the development of children, and  this is central to our commitment to providing a child-centred approach to  family policy.
