 Labor's asylum seeker crisis has our navy patrol boats literally cracking under  the pressure 

 10/08/12  

 Recent revelations have shown that our navy patrol boats are literally cracking under  the pressure of having to constantly intercept these unprecedented numbers of boat  arrivals, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael  Keenan said. 

 “Labor’s failure to protect our borders means that our Border Protection Command  have had to deal with an ever increasing workload that has overstretched their  resources and accelerated the wear of our patrol boats,” Mr Keenan said. 

 “With one vessel already deemed unfit for operations and another two already  showing signs of structural damage, it shows that unless Labor offers some solution  to this crisis immediately, the long term ability of the navy to patrol Australia’s  borders will be threatened. 

 “The people smugglers are making a laughing stock of this Labor Government by  putting out bogus distress calls so that our navy patrol boats are forced to travel  great distances to intercept these illegal vessels shortly after they leave the  Indonesian coast. 

 “This revelation comes as the biggest boat in five years under Labor, carrying 211  people, required the assistance of two navy patrol boats in this latest water taxi  operation. 

 “The Gillard Government must start fixing this crisis of their own making by  immediately restoring the funding it has slashed from Customs budget, including the  $64.1 million in funding and the 750 staff cuts. 

 “Until we see a return to the proven policies of the Howard Government, Border  Protection Command will continue to be placed under immense strain and pressure  whilst dealing with these almost daily illegal boat arrivals,” Mr Keenan said.
