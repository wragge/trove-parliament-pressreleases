 Greens welcome move to abolish detention  debts   

 

 The Greens have welcomed the introduction of legislation into the Senate to bring the end of  billing immigration detainees for their detention.   

 The Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill 2009 was tabled in the Senate today.   

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young congratulated Immigration Minister Chris Evans on  moving forward on the issue.   

 “The Greens have long opposed the imposition of detention debts and have been calling for this  policy to be changed for years,” she said.   

 “Detention debts have been a flagrant form of adding insult to injury to those who come to  Australia seeking our assistance and protection.”   

 Senator Hanson-Young said the Greens would be looking at the legislation in closer detail.   

 “On first reading, this legislation appears to be a necessary and overdue step forward,” she said.   

 “Detention debts are clearly out of step with the Rudd Government’s promise of a more  compassionate approach to immigration and asylum seeker issues.   

 “The next challenge for this Government will be to follow through with its sentiment and  implement this new, more humane approach by enshrining the principles in law.   

 “The Christmas Island detention facilities must also be shut down and all claims for asylum  processed on the mainland, with proper scrutiny and access to community support.   

 “The Greens will continue to keep a close eye on the Rudd Government’s encouraging moves in  immigration policy and legislation.”
