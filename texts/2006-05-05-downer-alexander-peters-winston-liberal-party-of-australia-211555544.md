 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: 5 May 2006 

 

 TITLE:    Transcript of Joint Press Conference with the Rt Hon. Winston Peters MP   

 

 

 MR PETERS:  I want to thank you all for coming along, we haven’t got too long, too much  time to answer your questions but we will provide some time, so who’s got the first question?   

 JOURNALIST: Well what did you discuss?   

 MR PETERS: We discussed the most immediate things on the radar screen right now, which  are the Solomon Islands naturally, the situation in Timor Leste and some wider matters to do  with our collective arrangements of working together in this part of the world and in Asia. 

 

 JOURNALIST: What do you make of the new Solomon Prime Minister’s commitment to  work with RAMSI into the future and to stand by the arrangements that currently stand?   

 MR PETERS:  Mr Downer knows the new Prime Minister better than I do so perhaps I  should pass the question onto him…   

 MR DOWNER:  Well first of all we congratulate Mr Sogavare on being elected Prime  Minister.  We will work with whoever the Solomon Islands Parliament elects as their Prime  Minister - that is a matter for the Solomon Islanders not for us - but as Winston says I do  know Mr Sogavare, I know him from the time when he was the Prime Minister before, and 

 we worked well with him then and I know we can work well with him now. We appreciate his  support for the ongoing RAMSI commitment.  RAMSI isn’t going to be there forever.  RAMSI isn’t designed to advance the interests of foreign powers in the Solomon Islands. 

 RAMSI is designed to help the Solomon Islands through a very difficult period. It was sent in  by the South Pacific countries, by the Pacific Island countries, in response to a request from  the former Prime Minister, Kemakeza and the then Governor General of the Solomon Islands.  

 So, you know, we’ve invested a lot in it and we will continue to do that. We’re happy to  continue to do that - to help Solomon Islands get on its feet. Then gradually once that’s  happened it will be possible for RAMSI to wind down, and I think Mr Sogavare recognizes  all of that and we are reading from the same page.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Downer, he’s said though that he wants a review of RAMSI, he’s said  that he’s concerned about Australian officials having such tight control over things like the  Prime Minister’s Office, how do you respond to that?   

 MR DOWNER: Well the Solomon Islanders and the Solomon Islands Government must be  masters of their own destiny; they must be responsible for their own country and the running  of their country.  We aren’t forcing anything on them, we are there to help them, at their own  request. So we do have some Australians - and there’ve been New Zealanders and people  from other Pacific Island Forum countries - who have been working within the Solomon  Islands bureaucracy and I think they’ve done a good job, and I think they provide a lot of  assistance.  But a new prime minister comes in and inevitably he will want to have a look at  the situation and see how it all works and get a better understanding of it. I mean he has not  been the prime minister - or not been in government - for a while, not recently and certainly  he hasn’t been the prime minister during the life of RAMSI.  So I think, as with the former  prime minister, there will need to be the evolution of a good and successful relationship  between the new prime minister and RAMSI and I’m confident that will happen.   

 MR PETERS:  I’d like to say that RAMSI was always up for review anyway.  We have a  new government being formed as we speak and we obviously need a renewed commitment or  new sign-up from within the Solomon Islands as to RAMSI.  It is for the Solomon Islands 

 new Government [inaudible] with respect to this [inaudible] arrangement, but let’s be in no  doubt whatsoever RAMSI is very critical - in my view, and in New Zealand’s view and I’m  sure it’s shared by Australia - to the long term good governance of the Solomon Islands. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Could there be a change in emphasis, change in tone, maybe even a change  in the operational on-the-ground activities of RAMSI as a result of the events in recent times?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well look, I think those events - which were serious and sad and were a  setback for the Solomon Islanders - those events can be put behind the Solomon Islands.  There will have to be reconstruction of the buildings that were wantonly destroyed but  nevertheless I think the Solomon Islands can put that behind it.  I think, as Winston says,  inevitably when you have a new government they want to have another look at all of these  arrangements and see what the mechanics are and who does what and how and why and 

 when. Why wouldn’t you?  Every time a new Government comes in in any country,  particularly if you have in place something as significant as RAMSI is to the life of the  country and the life of the Government - the Government would want to become familiar with  it and understand it and have a look at it and work it all through with the RAMSI people.  And  we welcome that, we’re happy to talk to them about that.  Let’s keep this perspective the right  way around, not the wrong way around.  RAMSI is costing us a tremendous amount of money  - a lot of Australians and New Zealanders and people from other Pacific island countries who  are taking a bit of a risk there, particularly those involved in the security side of things - and  so we’re doing this to help the people of the Solomon Islands at their request.  Now my sense  is that amongst the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands RAMSI has been extraordinarily  successful and very popular, it has been very popular, and I don’t think that - despite the  events of the other day - RAMSI has become less popular.  I don’t think the people of the  Solomon Islands are saying ‘there has been violence, so let’s get RAMSI out’ - I think they 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 3

 are saying that there has been violence and that reminds us that the underlying stability of the  country is still not there and we have a way to go.   

 JOURNALIST:  Nonetheless it sounds like it might be in Australia and New Zealand’s  interest to be thinking in terms of an exit strategy.  Because Mr Sogovare has used words like  that…   

 MR DOWNER:  Well there’ll always be an exit strategy.  It’s at their request. The RAMSI  operation is ultimately in the hands of the Solomon Islands government and the Solomon  Islands Parliament, but I’m just making the point that, as Mr Sogavare and others have said,  the public in the Solomon Islands don’t want RAMSI to withdraw now, but of course there 

 will be a time when it must.  What is I think likely to happen - I’ve explained this a number  of times in Australia - the military component of RAMSI, particularly the Australian and   New Zealand military components,  are likely to be downsized again relatively soon.  We  might leave some troops on the ground, like a company or so - we might, for some period of  time - but the police presence is likely to be there for substantially longer and the aid presence  - if you like, the assistance we provide to the Solomon Islands through our aid programs -  that’s likely to continue for the rest of our lives.  So when you talk about RAMSI it kind of  depends what you mean.   

 JOURNALIST: What did you discuss in regards to East Timor?   

 MR PETERS:  Well it’s a very difficult situation to read right now as there is emerging  information on an hourly basis, so I think the best way of describing it is, everything we  possibly could discuss by way of the intelligence on the ground that’s coming back to us.  But  I suppose our conclusion is to wait, watch and see what were dealing with.   It is after all an  operation run under the aegis of the United Nations and that agency is where…any action  which we might take.. .the decision will be made at that level.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  Is it most likely though that the current mandate will need to be extended?   Is that what you’re anticipating?   

 MR PETERS:  That’s the debate that’s being held, in a putative sense, tomorrow at the UN.   

 MR DOWNER:  The sense that we have from New York is that the United Nations, the  members of the UN, the members of the Security Council, feel the mandate should continue,  which is my view - I think it should.  They in East Timor have to accept responsibility for  their own affairs though, they can’t expect the United Nations to solve all their problems.   You have a particular issue here, which is the issue of the dismissal of 595 members of their  defence force over some grievances they had and how they dealt with those grievances.  The  East Timorese are setting up a Commission, an independent Commission, to look into their  grievances and claims.  I think that it is a good step forward. We would certainly welcome  that. The sooner this Commission can be set up the better, but in the meantime it is very  important that everybody in East Timor adheres to the Constitution and the rule of law.   You’ve got a difficult situation.  You think about it: 595 members of the military is a lot of 

 people, obviously particularly in a very small military like East Timor, but even in countries  like Australia and NZ that’s a lot of people - and the East Timorese government is rightly now 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 4

 setting up an independent Commission to look into these grievances, and that independent  commission, once established, should be able to get on with its work and produce its report  and conclusions and caution should be taken on the basis of that.  People should not act in an  extrajudicial way and they should adhere to the rule of law and the Constitution of East  Timor.  The East Timorese themselves are going to be responsible for dealing with all of that  and the UN can help, but the UN mission is fairly small - it can provide a bit of guidance and  so on but the East Timorese are going to have to do these things ultimately themselves. 

 

 MR PETERS:  The real I suppose thing that you won’t know is what shape will the UN have  after a decision is made, and a continuing mission there obviously NZ supports and we would  support that by way of an alternative to what is there now in terms of UN office but we will  have to see what the decision is.   

 JOURNALIST: Are you expecting to have to put more troops into there?   

 MR PETERS:  Well let me put it this way, I can’t presage what Cabinet might decide, but  given the fact that we have put our considerable support and commitment behind this country  I would think Cabinet would treat very sympathetically any request from the UN. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Peters, does New Zealand have a view about talking to Australia about a  Pacific Solution Mark 2 to deal with future asylum seekers coming to Australia and the way  they are processed? 

 

 MR PETERS: …Just run that past me again, I…   

 JOURNALIST:  Well there has been some talk that Australia, as a result of the recent  Papuan asylum seekers issue, might look at further processing of asylum seekers in that  category offshore again.  That obviously has implications for the region.  Does NZ have a  view about that kind of proposal?   

 MR PETERS:  Now we don’t have a view, we don’t express a view, on some other country’s  domestic politics.  I understand that the Australian decision is to, where people are legitimate  asylum seekers, evaluate those applications onshore, where there is any doubt about that then  they will be evaluated offshore, that’s as I understand it.  But it is not for me or any New 

 Zealand politician to interfere with the domestic politics of Australia.   

 JOURNALIST: But the last time this happened many of them ended up in your country.   

 MR PETERS:  That is true.  There was some uncertainty about that.  They were, under the  United Nations High Commission for Refugees, adjudged not to be refugees.  That was a  decision that they later changed, the UN Commission that is, and I don’t suppose it would be  unfair to say that Australia is in any way unhappy about our decision at this point in time.   That fair enough?   

 MR DOWNER:  You mean going back to 2001? We asked the New Zealand Government if  they would take some of the people, and they did.  We remember that and they did a good job  - but that was a long time ago. 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 5

 

 JOURNALIST:  Would you be asking them to maybe continue that kind of favour?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well, we don’t have anybody to ask them about.  We don’t have anybody  so it’s a kind of hypothetical question.  But this leads me to make one point about this and that  is that this new change that we’re making will act as an enormous disincentive to  opportunistic asylum-seeking if you like, as distinct from more profound concerns that people  might have.  That’s the point.  I suspect that it is not likely to be a very big problem because I  don’t think that you will get a large number of people operating in that way.  I might be  wrong, but I think what we have done in the past, from 2001, has proved to be very successful  and yet throughout that period we have taken 12 - 13 000 refugees. We are taking a lot of  refugees.  If you take over the last five years well that’s sixty thousand refugees - it might be a  little bit more than that - that we have taken in Australia. But we have stopped a pattern of  behaviour which was undermining the whole foundation of our system.  So, at one point there 

 in 2001 New Zealand helped us out and we are very appreciative of that, Miss Clark and Phil  Goff and so on were very helpful to us, but I don’t foresee the same situation arising again.   

 MR PETERS:  You know, we’ve both, as countries who have signed up to the UN refugee  program, got obligations to the United Nations, but anyone who jumps that program denies  someone else legitimately on it their chance to be properly evaluated for admission to  Australia and New Zealand and we should never forget that.  OK thanks a lot… 

 

 MR DOWNER:  Hang on, we haven’t talked about the Forum, I just suddenly thought.  I was  going to ask the question myself…Well this is the third of the Forums.  The first was in  Wellington two years ago, 2004, the second in Melbourne. Its an opportunity to get together  community leaders - if I could put it that way - a lot of them are business people but also  people from the media and academia and so on in Australia and New Zealand.  I think it is a  very good way of consolidating the understanding and - more than that - the commitment in  our two countries to each other. This was set up to make sure that opinion leaders in Australia  and New Zealand did understand each other.  Where there were differences - and Australia  and New Zealand are different countries so you wouldn’t expect us always to agree with each  other as countries - I don’t just mean the Governments, but as countries - on everything.  We  have different geostrategic positions in the world, we have somewhat different demographic  profiles, and we have different economies, economic structures.  All those things do lead to  differences between our two countries, but the important thing is that we don’t let those  differences, which are natural, do anything to undermine the great strengths of the relationship  between Australia and New Zealand, which obviously has very deep roots in history.  From  Australia’s perspective I think it is important Australians don’t take New Zealand for granted,  that they think about New Zealand and work with New Zealanders and they understand New  Zealand’s perspectives, they understand New Zealand’s concerns, they understand how New  Zealanders look at Australia and they think about that, they become aware of that.  New  Zealand has its own - I think Winston can speak for New Zealand - but there’d be New  Zealand reasons why it is good for them to be developing these networks with Australia.   Finally, it’s a great way of networking - of significant Australians and significant New  Zealanders building relationships out of which all sorts of things can happen, and business  deals can be done and personal friendships evolve and all kinds of good things will happen.

 MR PETERS: Well our view, from New Zealand’s perspective, that any trading,  commercial, economic, communion or fellowship between out two countries, carried out with  commitment and energy and some unction, can only be to the advantage of our dual  economies and I believe that this conference therefore has a significant chance being (a)  successful and (b) advancing the economic causes of both New Zealand and Australia. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  Talking about differences, there’s a significant sporting match on this  evening.  Will you have an opportunity in your discussions to break to watch the rugby league  test?   

 MR PETERS:  Well Alexander is an Australian Rules man and we play the manly game of  rugby here more than we play league, but I think we’ve got a good chance tonight.   

 MR DOWNER:  Personally I think Australia will win.   

 JOURNALIST:  But you know, taking it through the lens of this test, who has done better  out of twenty years of CER…?   

 MR DOWNER:  Economically?  Or sport?   

 JOURNALIST:  No from the players on the field tonight...   

 MR PETERS:  I tell you what’s happened here, you’ve got our guy as your fullback for  Australia and we’ve got your guy as fullback for New Zealand…   

 JOURNALIST:  We’ve got five Australians…   

 MR DOWNER:  Well it just shows how well we get on with each other…   

 MR PETERS:  And we’ve got an excuse if we lose….
