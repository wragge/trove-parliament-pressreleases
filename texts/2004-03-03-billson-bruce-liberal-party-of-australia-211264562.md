 MEDIA RELEASE  PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY  FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE THE HON BRUCE BILLSON MP 

 AA 05 010 3 March 2005 

 Australian Help for Earthquake Relief in Iran 

 Australia will contribute $350,000 to assist with emergency relief efforts after the devastating  earthquake in Iran late last month, the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade,  Mr Bruce Billson announced today.

 The funding will be channelled through the International Federation of the Red Cross to the  Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).

 'The Australian Government, through AusAID, will help provide urgently needed food  supplies and medical support to victims of the disaster,' Mr Billson said.

 'Australia's $250,000 assistance to IRCS will replenish emergency relief stocks close to being  exhausted, support current operations and provide desperately needed items such as tents,  ground sheets, blankets, kerosene stoves, cooking sets and food.

 'Replenishing relief stocks will also help make people in affected areas less vulnerable to  shortages during floods which are expected in the Spring,' Mr Billson said.

 'The $100,000 contribution to the WHO will provide additional medical equipment and  pharmaceuticals to help the many injured in the earthquake.

 'The WHO needs assessment identified damage to regional health facilities and a shortage of  medical equipment and life saving drugs,' Mr Billson said.

 'More than 600 people were killed and about 1,400 injured in the disaster which hit Kerman  province on February 22. About 90,000 people in Zarand City and 103 surrounding villages  were affected by damage to their homes and local infrastructure.

 'The IRCS is distributing food baskets, also containing hygiene kits, to 7,000 families and  providing shelter to more than 12,000 people in halls and schools.

 'Australian Government assistance will also fund counselling support and medical teams to  help those in villages traumatised by the disaster, especially children,' Mr Billson said.

 Other international agencies such as UNHCR and UNICEF are also providing emergency  assistance and expertise in disease surveillance.

 In 2004-2005, Australia increased funding for our international humanitarian, emergency and  refugee programs by an estimated $14 million to $146 million.
