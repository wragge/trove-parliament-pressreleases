 Australia and Papua New Guinea  Sign MoU Friday, 19 August 2011

 The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea have  signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the  establishment of an assessment centre on Manus Island,  the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen  MP, said today.  See: Australia/PNG MoU (27KB PDF file)

 The Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs and  Immigration, Ano Pala and Australia's High Commissioner  to Papua New Guinea, Ian Kemish, signed the  Memorandum of Understanding in Port Moresby this  afternoon.

 Mr Bowen said the signing was the positive next step  towards establishing an assessment centre on Manus  Island.

 'This is a welcome and important development in setting up  an assessment centre on Manus Island for asylum seekers  and formalises this arrangement between Australia and 

 Papua New Guinea,' Mr Bowen said.

 'Our two countries share a strong and longstanding  relationship on migration and recognise the need for  cooperative measures to respond to the complex regional  challenge of irregular migration.

 'This Government is committed to breaking the people  smuggling trade. The Manus Island centre will complement  the Malaysia transfer arrangement and provide further  disincentive for people considering risking their lives on  dangerous boat journeys.'

 Mr Bowen said the Memorandum of Understanding  provided a framework for ongoing discussions with PNG on  the operational details of the assessment centre.

 'We are committed to working in partnership with PNG to  operationalise the assessment centre at the earliest  opportunity,' he said.

 'This MOU sends a clear message that countries in this  region are working together towards a lasting regional  response in taking action necessary to ensure the integrity 

 of our borders and undermine people smuggling networks.'
