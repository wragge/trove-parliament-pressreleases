 THE HON. BILL SHORTEN  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  MEMBER FOR MARIBYRNONG   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 NATIONAL CRISIS SUMMIT ON FAMILY VIOLENCE   

 Today, I have written to the to the Prime Minister seeking his bipartisan support to  hold a national crisis summit on family violence.    

 Labor has also called on the Prime Minister to support a number of interim measures  to ensure women and their children affected by family violence are getting the  support they need.    

 In particular Labor wants to make sure women are getting the legal support they  need - irrespective of where they live - and that they have somewhere safe to go.    

 There is no clearer symbol of continuing gender inequality in our society than the  epidemic of violence against women. The biggest risk factor for being a victim of  family violence is being a woman.   

 The latest research shows:    

 â 1 in 3 Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of  15;  â 17 per cent of Australian women have experienced violence by a current or  previous partner in their lifetime; and  â 20 per cent of Australian women who have experienced current partner 

 violence reported it to police.

 A national crisis summit on family violence is required for the Commonwealth, state  and territory governments to agree to urgently implement coordinated judicial and  social services reform within their areas of responsibility to better deal with family  violence.    

 A national crisis summit on family violence is the best way for stakeholders to openly  and transparently lay down the key policy challenges for addressing family violence.    

 In the meantime, we have a responsibility to ensure women can get the legal  support they need, irrespective of where they live.   

 We have a responsibility to ensure women have somewhere safe to go if they’re  being abused - whether that is their own home, or somewhere else.   

 The nightmare of family violence is a reality for far too many Australian women. No-one should have to face this ordeal on their own.   

 Labor’s interim measures will deliver more than $70 million over three years in  targeted funding to ensure those suffering from family violence can access critical  services when they need them.   

 Labor will commit almost $50 million to frontline legal services, including Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services to ensure women suffering from family  violence get legal support. The aim of this is to ensure, at least, that women facing  court have access to appropriate legal services.   

 We will also make an initial investment of $15 million in Safe at Home grants to help  people affected by family violence stay safe in their own home.    

 In addition, Labor will invest $8 million in perpetrator mapping to look at the  interactions across family violence, law enforcement, justice, child protection and  related systems to help identify opportunities to prevent violence through  information sharing.   

 Labor’s plan for a national crisis summit on family violence has been developed in  consultation with experts, academics and advocates like Australian of the Year, Rosie  Batty.    

 I have held two roundtable discussions with stakeholders on the matter of family  violence, in Sydney and in Melbourne’s West with committed advocate, the Member  for Gellibrand Tim Watts. Today’s announcement has involved a significant amount  of work by the Member for Gellibrand, together with the Deputy Labor Leader,  Tanya Plibersek and Shadow Ministers Jenny Macklin, Mark Dreyfus, Claire Moore  and Jan McLucas.   

 I was elected Labor Leader on a mandate to make family violence a national political  priority.   

 In recent years, there has been considerable evidence gathered by inquiries in  Queensland and South Australia and Victoria has commenced a Royal Commission.    

 In Government, Labor created the first National Plan to Reduce Violence Against  Women and their Children. The national crisis summit seeks to build on this work  with a program for clear action.     

 Our progress has been uneven and too slow. We must put domestic violence at the  centre of national political debate in order to change these chilling statistics. We  need a national crisis summit.   

 I urge the Prime Minister to work with Labor on this most important of issues as a  matter of urgency.

 There is no clearer symbol of continuing gender inequality in our society than the epidemic  of violence against women. 

 The biggest risk factor for being a victim of family violence is being a woman.  1 in 3 Australian women  have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. That’s not good enough; in fact that is a crisis.

 The latest research shows: 

 * 1 in 3 Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15; * 17 per cent of Australian women have experienced violence by a current or previous   partner in their lifetime; and * 20 per cent of Australian women who have experienced current partner violence   reported it to police.

 Labor calls on the Prime Minister to hold a National Crisis Summit on family violence with State and Territory  Leaders and to openly engage with sector stakeholders to coordinate a national response to family violence.

 If not, within the *rst 100 days of coming to Government, Labor will commission a National Crisis Summit.

 A national crisis summit on violence against women is required for the Commonwealth, state and territory  governments to agree to urgently implement coordinated judicial and social services reform within their areas  of responsibility to better deal with family violence. 

 A national crisis summit on violence against women is the best way for stakeholders to openly and  transparently lay down the key policy challenges for addressing family violence. 

 Family violence isolates, excludes and traumatises its victims - it disconnects people from community, work,  education, friends and family.

 So far this year, we’ve seen an average of two deaths a week of women at the hands of their partners or  former-partners. The de*nitive risk factor for experiencing family violence is being a woman. 

 In recent years there has been a growth in public awareness, and the evidence for tackling family violence.   The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children (National Plan) put in place by Labor  in o*ce (2010-2022), has also driven a range of world leading strategies as well as action by community and  for-pro*t sectors.

 Over the past few years, considerable evidence has emerged through the South Australian Parliamentary  Inquiry into Domestic and Family Violence, the Special Taskforce on Domestic and Family Violence in  Queensland and the Commonwealth Senate Inquiry - Domestic violence in Australia and further evidence is  being gathered in the landmark Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence. 

 Fact Sheet - National Crisis Summit

 The National Crisis Summit seeks to build on this work with a program for clear action - to prioritise, bring  forward innovation and better coordination. 

 And ultimately, to end the ‘postcode lottery’ that results in di*erent outcomes for victims in di*erent locations. 

 From the Summit, a Federal Labor Government will seek a new deal on coordinated judicial and social services  reform to better respond and prevent family violence. 

 The key policy challenges that Labor will seek to have addressed in a new comprehensive national strategy  will include: 

 1. Ensuring no victim of family violence has to go to court alone to ask for protection   for herself and her children:

 * Consider additional investments in community legal centres and greater protections for people    escaping family violence. 

 * Embed within support services the diverse needs of victims from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander    backgrounds, migrants, refugees and people from a non-English speaking background, people with    disability, older women and other vulnerable groups. 

 2. Building the capacity of the judicial system to deal with family violence:

 * Strengthening the way in which the legal system currently operates with respect to family violence,    and any implications for legislative and administrative reform; 

 * Improving training arrangements for state and federal magistrates and judges to better respond to    and manage family law and family violence cases; and 

 * Prioritising the safety of women and children in the court environment, including better court access    and support facilities for families in the form of improved court security, child care and support for    litigants navigating the system (through the courts and family mediation centres).  

 * Coordinating best practice approaches to the critical role performed by police in all jurisdictions in    responding to family violence and providing immediate support for those a*ected.

 3. Delivering more certainty for homelessness services:

 * Family violence is the leading cause of homelessness for women and children. The Summit will    address the increased demand for services, and explore options for more innovation in service     delivery to prevent family crises and better link services across the spectrum. 

 * All jurisdictions must work to ensure women and children escaping family violence have safe and    supported emergency accommodation. There is also a need for support for specialist services that    assist women in emergency situations

 * Within the context of the National Crisis Summit, this may also involve ensuring that the National    Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (NPAH) and the National A*ordable Housing Agreement    recognise increased demand for homelessness and supported housing services resulting from   family violence.

 4.   Enabling women and their children experiencing family violence to remain safely in their   current home:

 * On average, survivors of family violence are required to move three times, leaving their families,    communities, workplaces, schools and support networks.

 * Rather than be forced into supported housing we will develop a national Safe at Home program to    enable victims to stay in their community, access their support networks and continue to participate    in work, training, education and school, through increased access to safety assessments, infrastructure    like CCTV, safety alarms, locks, security doors and case management

 * The National Crisis Summit can further explore how being safe at home also links to legislative     change, including family violence intervention orders which are currently being made consistent,    recognised and e*ective across jurisdictions as started by Labor in the National Plan. 

 5.   Establishing greater perpetrator accountability mechanisms:

 * Long term strategies for interrupting violent behaviours through information sharing, combined with    research to increase our knowledge of how perpetrators track through these systems and the     e*ectiveness of risk assessment systems. 

 * Consistent national standards for behavioural programs, sharing of best practice and continual    evaluation of their e*ectiveness.

 * Further, supporting greater understanding and responses to the correlation and impact of alcohol and    drug abuse on incidence of family violence is important.

 6.   Addressing fragmented responses to family violence: 

 * Develop better measures progress in the response to family violence.

 * Mutually recognised and consistent intervention orders.

 * Better sharing of best practice and ensure states and territories commit to resourcing death review    processes: a mistake that costs a woman or child their life should not be made twice. 

 * Implementation of continued training for NDIS and other disability and aged care providers. We call    on the Government to ensure that resources are dedicated to this through the NDIS Sector     Development Fund and appropriate aged care programs.

 * Mental health policies and programs for victims and perpetrators. 

 7.   Preventing family violence in the *rst place through attitudinal change:

 * Properly resource the objectives of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and Children,    including recognition of the National Primary Prevention Framework currently being developed by    OurWATCh, Australian National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety (ANROWS) and VicHealth   by mid-2015. 

 * Continued support for programs in schools, sporting clubs, workplaces and the media that promote    respectful relationships and address gender prejudice. This should include programs that go beyond    the school gate and engage young people, for example via social media. National standards and    better evaluation could assist drive more e*ective programs. 

 * Work with the States and Territories develop best practice approaches to prevention and early     intervention including through enhancing the immediacy of accountability and intervention  orders, engaging men in community conversation and promoting the importance and value of    culture in combatting unequal attitudes towards women.

 * The development of a national gender equality framework to tackle the key causes of violence against    women, build respectful relationships and improve gender equality.  Respect between men and    women can address the attitudes that support violence. The development of a framework would    require a new Federal-State agreement to progress action, with the COAG Select Council on Women’s    Issues disbanded in December 2013.

 Labor will make a series of critical investments in services and programs that directly support women and  children escaping family violence.

 Labor’s interim package will deliver more than $70 million over three years in targeted funding to ensure  those su*ering from family violence can access critical services. 

 1. $47.4 million for targeted legal services   Invest $42.9 million in frontline legal services to ensure women threatened by violence are     not alone in going through the legal system as well as $4.5 million for Family Violence Prevention    Legal Services (FVPLS) to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their children   experiencing family violence: 

 * Invest in community legal centres (CLCs) and frontline services to better support people a*ected by    family violence going through the court system including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal    services. The new funding we are announcing for community legal centres will be targeted at     providing assistance in family violence and related matters.

 * Embedded within support services will be the diverse needs of victims from Aboriginal and Torres    Strait Islander backgrounds, migrants, refugees and people from a non-English speaking background,    people with disability, older women and other vulnerable groups. 

 *  Family Violence Prevention Legal Services have provided frontline and holistic legal assistance for the    past 15  years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander victims of family violence, in 31 regional and    remote locations. Labor will provide support for additional capacity to FVPLS to share best practice    with other legal services on culturally-speci*c-training and build capacity within the organisation.

 2. Invest an initial $15 million in a Safe at Home grants program that will  Provide grants to community organisations, local government or other appropriate providers that    help people a*ected by family violence stay safe in their own homes and in their communities. This    could include infrastructure such as:

 * key changes and lock upgrades to doors and windows * sensor and security lighting * security screen doors * external CCTV cameras, training and monitoring * alarm systems 

  In addition, we will map and understand best practice of existing state safe and home strategies,    including risk assessments, for implementation across Australia. 

 3. Invest $8.4 million to improve perpetrator interaction mapping.   Develop research on mapping perpetrator interactions across family violence, law enforcement,    justice, child protection and related systems. Including: 

 * Identify and monitor opportunities to interrupt forthcoming violent behaviours through information    sharing and speci*c accountability strengthening measures.

 * Research to increase our knowledge of how perpetrators track through these systems

 * Better understand the role and e*ectiveness of risk assessment systems to build a comprehensive    understanding of perpetrator behaviours, including a longitudinal study.  In addition to these measures, Labor has set aside funding to hold the National Crisis Summit.
