 BUSINESS AS USUAL IN 2012 

 Posted on Wednesday, 25 January, 2012 

 

 

 The first two illegal arrivals of the New Year highlight that it is business as usual for  people smugglers under Labor’s self induced border protection crisis, Acting Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs  and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.  

 "Julia Gillard’s first priority for 2012 should be to repair the damage that the Labor  Party has done since coming to office, to Australia’s system of border protection.  

 "Abolishing offshore processing, scraping temporary protection visas and refusing to  implement their policy of turning boats around has reinvigorated people smuggling  and resulted in a policy catastrophe for Australia.  

 "We can only expect to see the people smugglers commanding position over our  borders continue to strengthen unless the Labor Party implements the Coalition’s  proven policy prescription.
