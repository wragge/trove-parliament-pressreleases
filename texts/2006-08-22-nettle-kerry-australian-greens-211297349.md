 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 Cruel to send Burmese asylum seekers to Nauru 

 

 Senator Nettle, 22nd August 2006 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said today that it would be callous and  unnecessary for Senator Vanstone to send the Burmese asylum seekers to Nauru now  they had an Australia lawyer and have a strong case for protection.  

 "Sending these Burmese to Nauru would be a callous and unnecessary act. They  should be processed in the community in Australia," said Senator Nettle.  

 "The community and parliament recently made it clear they do not support sending  asylum seekers to Nauru. 

 "Nobody has been sent to Nauru for almost five years. The Minister seems intent on  sending these asylum seekers to Nauru out of spite having lost the argument for  sending asylum seekers to Nauru in the parliament. 

 "Only one man remains on Nauru. Off-shore processing should be shut down not re-started. 

 "Burma is known to persecute minority groups and democracy activists. Australia  should be providing protection, not further discrimination. 

 "The Minister will not be pleasing anyone but the Burmese regime if she sends these  asylum seekers to Nauru."
