 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 Howard signals divisive election tactics with  dropping of multiculturalism 

 

 Senator Nettle, 23rd January 2007   

 Greens Multicultural Affairs Spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle today called on  incoming Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews to publicly commit the government to  supporting multiculturalism in Australia in the wake of multiculturalism being  dropped from the title of his department.    

 "Multiculturalism has been a massively successful policy in Australia and Mr  Andrews should acknowledge this and commit to supporting its objectives of respect,  celebration of diversity and non-discrimination.    

 "The Greens also call on Mr Andrews to start his new job by ending the cruel practice  on mandatory detention of asylum seekers and begin by bringing the 7 Burmese  asylum seekers now on Nauru to Australia.    

 "As far as Senator Vanstone is concerned then, if the rumour of an overseas posting is  true, perhaps a posting to Kabul, Afghanistan would be the most appropriate job the  Prime Minister could offer her."
