 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Three illegal boats in three days August 27, 2013

 The arrival of another illegal boat, with a total of 73 people on board, is the third in three days and takes total arrivals since Labor’s  PNG  election  fix  was  announced  to  over  3,100  people,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Over 150 people have arrived illegally in the last three days and a total of 3,148 since Kevin Rudd announced his PNG election fix,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Kevin Rudd’s and Tony Burke’s big talk on their PNG arrangement is being exposed on a daily basis. Boats continue to arrive and yet there are no detailed guidelines on the resettlement of refugees in PNG.

 “Labor’s talk is no substitute for an agreement on how people will be resettled in PNG. Once again Labor is all talk and no delivery on their big announcements and people smugglers know it.

 “Australians will have the chance at the election to stop the boats by electing a Coalition Government. Three more years of Labor will see three more years of boats and three more years of cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders,” Mr Morrison  said.

 Mr Keenan said: "The daily ferry service to Australia continues courtesy of the people smugglers.

 "Despite Mr Rudd's false claims that his PNG arrangement is stopping the boats, the facts speak for themselves with 25 boats carrying almost 1700 people having arrived this month alone.

 "The boats will continue arriving as long as Labor is in Government - the people smugglers know that Labor is just not  serious about stopping them.

 "To  break  the  people  smugglers’  business  model  you  need  to  implement  a  suite  of  tough  border  protection  policies  -something the Coalition will do if elected on 7 September," Mr Keenan said.
