 TAMPA PROCEEDINGS

 The  Commonwealth  has  filed  submissions  with  the  High  Court  opposing  a  move  to have the special leave application relating to the Tampa case heard urgently.

 Mr  Eric  Vardarlis  is  seeking  special  leave  to  appeal  the  Full  Court  of  the  Federal Court’s  decision  in  favour  of  the  Commonwealth  Government’s  action  in  relation  to the  rescuees  from  the  MV  Tampa.   Mr  Vardarlis  has  requested  the  application  be heard  expeditiously,  which  would  in  effect  mean  it  would  be  listed  for  hearing  in December.

 The Commonwealth opposes this application because:

 â¢ The nature of the application does not require an expeditious hearing as it has been a  month  since  the  Full  Court  decision  and  Mr  Vardarlis  did  not  seek  any interim orders  from  the  High  Court  preventing  the  Commonwealth  from  transporting  the rescuees to Nauru.

 â¢ There is no prejudice to Mr Vardarlis if  his application were heard in the normal way.   The  rescuees  are  on  Nauru  or  in  New  Zealand  and  any  applications  for refugee status are being dealt with in those countries.

 â¢ A decision to expedite the application might adversely affect the interests of other High Court litigants whose cases would be delayed.

 â¢ The Commonwealth considers that Mr Vardarlis’ special leave application is weak, and that the Full Court’s decision was correct.  In addition, the issues Mr Vardarlis raises are moot because:

 - The factual situation has changed as the rescuees are being processed in Nauru and New Zealand.  Contrary to Mr Vardarlis’ claims, the Commonwealth has not agreed to bring the rescuees back to Australia if his High Court appeal is successful; and

 - Part  Two  of  the  Border  Protection  (Validation  and  Enforcement  Powers)  Act 2001  now  provides  statutory  authority  for  the  Commonwealth’s  actions  in addition to the executive authority found by the majority of the Full Court of the Federal Court.

 The Commonwealth’s position all along has been that legal proceedings relating to the Tampa  have  been  unnecessary.   As  the  rescuees’  applications  for  refugee  status  are being processed, further court actions are a waste of time and taxpayers’ money.

 The High Court will hear the application for expedition in Melbourne on Monday.
