 BARNABY JOYCE VISITS CANNING Thursday, 25 March 2010 

 Senator Barnaby Joyce’s first visit to Canning attracted more than 150 locals to Redcliffe on  the Murray.    

 Hosted by Canning MP Don Randall, the Community Afternoon Tea gave local residents the  opportunity to hear Senator Joyce address a range of issues including the state of the  Nation’s finances, the impact of rising interest rates and the challenges facing rural and  regional Australia.    

 Mr Randall said it was fitting that Senator Joyce was named Shadow Minister for Regional  Development, Infrastructure and Water on the same day he visited the Peel Region.    

 “He’s been labeled a hero and a villain but Barnaby is certainly colorful and well respected  and a great fighter for the interests of rural and regional Australians,” Mr Randall told the  crowd.    

 “Senator Joyce spoke about the implications of the soon to be released Henry Tax Review,  the importance of GST revenue to Western Australia and the potential viability of piping  water from the Kimberley to Perth.”    

 When it comes to the influx of Asylum seekers Senator Joyce stressed that Australia had a  long history of being a “compassionate country” but stronger border protection measures  were vital to preserving the integrity of Australia’s immigration system.    

 Coming from a farming background and owning a thriving family accountancy business in  Queensland, Senator Joyce addressed the concerns of local farmers and orchardists about  the viability of their businesses with produce prices falling.    

 Senator Joyce noted that with around 80 per cent of the buying power dominated by  supermarket giants it was the famers and the consumers who ended up paying the biggest  price.    

 “With the South Western Australia being home to thousands of cattle and dairy farmers the  issue of Australia importing beef from mad cow affected countries was high on the local  agenda,” Mr Randall said.    

 “If there was an outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in Western Australia beef producers  throughout the Peel Region and South West could be decimated.”    

 “Despite stalling lifting the ten year old ban until after the Federal Election, the Rudd  Government has shown its willingness to throw caution to the wind when it comes to local  families livelihoods.”
