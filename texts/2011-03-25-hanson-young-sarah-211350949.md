 MEDIA RELEASE    Off Shore Processing Descends Into Farce   

 Reports that customs forced a boat of asylum seekers to stop on Ashmore Reef so  that they could be denied legal protections in Australia, is further evidence of the  farcical nature of off-shore processing, the Australian Greens said.    

 “Despite the High Court ruling last year that all asylum seekers should have access  to the same legal protections - the Government is still actively denying asylum  seekers basic procedural fairness,” said the Greens Immigration Spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.    

 “There is no practical, humane or logical reason for not treating asylum seekers  equally.”   

 “Once again, for the Government the welfare of these people is secondary to  domestic politics.”   

 “If these reports are true, the Government has behaved deceptively in an effort to by-pass Australian law.”    

 “The Government needs to dump off shore processing, Christmas Island should be  closed and asylum seekers should have their claims processed on the mainland with  time limits on their detention.”
