 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON PHILIP RUDDOCK MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPT   

 November 6, 2003  

 

 DOORSTOP: RUDDOCK DISCUSSES LEGISLATION BANNING  TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS; BORDER PROTECTION 

 

 QUESTION:   

 

 Mr Ruddock, the minor parties say that the Government's given no justification for recalling  the Senate to pass these terror laws on Friday.  How do you justify the cost of recalling the  Senate?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL, PHILIP RUDDOCK:    

 I thought we were talking about awards for Emergency Management.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 Oh yeah, we'll do that later.   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 We'll do that later [laughs].  I should always follow my practice of giving you some  introductory remarks first. But, let me just say that I've offered to both of the minor parties to  brief them on the issues.  But, one expects on something of this sort that they may have a  different view, and want to strike a discordant note.  But, I guess if I was in the Labor Party  I'd call it wedge politics.   

 But having put that to one side, I mean this is a very, very important issue because we've had  advice from the competent agencies that each of these organisations has mounted and  continue to mount terrorist operations abroad, and in one case, the organisation has linkages  with Australia.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 What's the agency though, what do you fear could happen?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 Well, no, no.  Would you let me, would you let me time to finish?  Okay?  As I outlined at  Question Time yesterday, there are a number of consequences that result from being  associated with a terrorist organisation.  And even though there are provisions which make  the operation of this commensurate with the date on which the Bill was introduced, the fact is 

 Parliament House, Canberra  ACT  2600 â¢ Telephone (02) 6277 7300 â¢ Fax (02) 6273 4102  www.law.gov.au/ag 

 that you cannot apply those provisions or risk claims that they had operated retrospectively if  you, if you don't move to deal with these issues quickly.   

 Now, in terms of the reality, the reality is that the Senators have been, in the main, in  Canberra, associated with estimates committees that are meeting this week.  It's not really a  question of getting them back.  It's a question of having Senators who are available to ensure  the passage of this legislation in a timely way. And given the nature of what we are doing -  dealing with terrorist organisations, one of which has linkages to Australia, the Government's  view is we need to deal with this issue as soon as possible.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 Are there people in Australia now who you want to prosecute as soon as you've got this  legislation through?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 If, if there were I wouldn't be telling you.  But, the issue is one of ensuring that people are  aware that organisations like this, which some people may have linkages with, ought to be  severed, and there are severe consequences if they maintain those sorts of linkages.  That's the  message I would want to bring.  If, if as the legislation provides, I, as the Attorney General  make a judgment that these bodies should be prescribed.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 Are there any other groups that you might consider putting on the banned, Australia's banned  list, and we have to go through the whole parliamentary process again to get them banned?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 Well, I mean, that's the point isn't it?  That there are numbers of organisations that have been  prescribed in other countries, to which I have not had advice from our authority that because  of the failure of the UN Security Council to deal with the issue, that we should proceed now.   

 But I think what this is, is an example of why the Bill that we have had in the Senate since  June, which would provide a basis for regulation to deal with it, and which can still be  disallowed by the parliament when the parliament returns, ought to be enacted.    

 I mean, the point I've been making all through this is that these procedures do involve costs,  they do involve potential inconvenience.  It may not be as convenient at another time to recall  the Senate if, if I receive advice that there is a need to prescribe a body.    

 So we would like to see the Opposition agree to the passage of the Bill that's been before the  Senate since last June.  But, in this case, I hope that, that the Senate does support the measure  tomorrow, that the change to the enactment is made and then I can undertake the tasks that I  have to as Attorney to consider whether or not prescription is required.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 So at the moment it's only LET and Hamas?  There's no other groups that the government  may consider banning?

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 Look, there are possibly other groups on which we may receive advice.  But we haven't  received advice at this stage.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 Attorney, a little Indonesian fishing boat succeeded in slipping past Operation Relex.  Do you  think this operation should be beefed up again - it was scaled back in July because of  dwindling boat arrivals - should it be reviewed now?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 Look, they're operational issues, and obviously consideration is always given to what, what is  required, as a result of experience. But I'd simply make the point that we've had an  extraordinary period of, of successfully ensuring that boats have not come to Australia.  It's  been through a comprehensive range of measures involving not only policing functions,  coast(watch), Customs, Australian Defence Forces, immigration, foreign affairs, relationships  with other countries, as well as doing what we need to do, and the effectiveness of the Pacific  Solution along with the returns that were possible last year.   

 And a number of people have wanted to downplay the, the success that we have achieved.   Because, if you look at what's been happening in Europe, unauthorised arrivals have not  stopped.  People are looking to see where they can obtain migration outcomes by using  people smugglers. So, there has to be, I think, or there has to be credit to the Government for  the measures that have achieved a remarkable outcome in which there have only been two  arrivals in two years - involving less, I think, than about 65 people.    

 Now having, have said that, I think it's also important to recognise that you need to remain  vigilant.  If you don't remain vigilant, inevitably the smugglers will fill the void.  And so, I  can assure you that this is a whole of government issue in which government will want to  ensure that border protection remains effective.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 [indistinct] less than 55 people, is cheaper, more effective to bring them to the mainland,  process them and return them if they're not refugees and giving them visas if they are?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 The issue is one in which you only have to look at what happened when people had a view  that Australia was open for business.  It wasn't 64 people, it was 4000 people a year. And the  point I would make is that the demand for places in western societies and the benefits that it  brings mean that people smugglers will fill that if you do not remain vigilant. It is not a  question of saying, because we've been successful and it's only 65 we don't have to strive for  success.  The, the situation is quite clear.  If you were to relent on the measures that you have  implemented, we would be as open for business as we were two and a half years ago, with the  prospect of 10,000 unauthorised arrivals. Okay?   

 QUESTION:   

 

 Just on another matter [indistinct] …

 ATTORNEY GENERAL RUDDOCK:    

 Emergency management?   

 QUESTION:   

 … not quite your portfolio …   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL RUDDOCK:    

 Emergency management?   

 QUESTION:   

 

 … do you think we'll be alienating countries like New Zealand and the Netherlands by issuing  travel advisories today?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:    

 Look, I don't comment on those matters.  The government acts on advice, and if your travel  advisories were to be affected by political considerations, it would leave Australians exposed.   

 QUESTION:   

 

 Yesterday when Mr Crean mentioned the [indistinct], the term 'wedge politics' you responded  in parliament saying that you weren't really aware of the term.  Were you really not aware of  it, or--?   

 ATTORNEY GENERAL:   

 No. Look, the point I'm making is that in politics there have always been differences of view.   And if you, if you want to use the term like ‘wedge’ politics to suggest that because there are  differences of view in relation to Australian security or border protection, you ought not to  highlight it, but if there are differences of view where you think you'll be politically  advantaged in relation to education, or health, where you are creating a wedge, a difference,  in some way it doesn't deserve a term of derision.   

 The only point I'm making is that I will deal with issues, quite frankly.  I'm not in the business  of playing the man, and in relation to the issues that I'm dealing with, it seems the Labor Party  are more intent on trying to, in some way, demonise me, and I think that's because they don't  have the arguments. I think people only talk about wedge politics when they don't have the  arguments. Okay?
