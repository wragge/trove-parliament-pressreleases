 Wed, 29th April 2009   TORRES STRAIT THREATENED BY ANOTHER BIO-SECURITY ASYLUM  SEEKER BUNGLE 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 In another episode, the Federal Government has picked up four asylum seekers on  Deliverance Island off Cape York, about 55 km’s south of PNG and transferred to  detention on Horn Island.  

 The Rudd Labour Government acknowledges it has no idea how the asylum seekers  got there, or, presumably how long they had been in the region, and where they  have previously come onshore.  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Dr Sharman Stone said that  effective border security, in particular in the Torres Strait continues to be beyond the  capability of the Rudd Government.  

 “In a bizarre episode several months ago two asylum seekers were picked up in a  floating esky a short distance off shore. The Australian public has never been told  how the men came to be there or who dropped them off, or where they had been.  Presumably the mystery remains unsolved.”  

 “On the 1st of April a large contingent of nearly 50 asylum seekers including minors  were stranded on Warrior Reef in the Torres Strait for four days while customs  officials apparently stood off wondering what to do. When a storm was imminent the  people were finally rescued and taken around to Christmas Island,” Dr Stone said.  

 Dr Stone said the Torres Straits remains Australia’s most critical buffer zone in terms  of detecting and eliminating new diseases and pest species, typically transferred on  board illegal small boats.  

 “The indigenous communities in the Torres Strait deserve better protection of their  environment, health and well being, and mainland Australia must be better protected  from new bio-security threats,” Dr Stone said.  

 “ With Swine Fever the latest potential epidemic, we simply cannot continue to  bungle border protection.”  

 “The Coalition has called for a comprehensive inquiry into the impacts of the  softened policies, reduced capacity and bungled strategies of the Rudd government.”  

 “This latest episode is one more example of how urgent the problem is,” Dr Stone  said.
