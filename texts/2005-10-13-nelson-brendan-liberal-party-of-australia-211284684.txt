 Media Release

 CELEBRATING DEMOCRACY WEEK 2005

 13 October 2005 MIN 2017/05 

 I am pleased to announce that over 300 schools will receive Australian Government  grants to help them showcase civics and citizenship education activities in their local  communities as part of Celebrating Democracy Week 2005, which I launched yesterday  in Canberra.

 Celebrating Democracy Week 2005, which runs from October 12 to 19, is a popular  nationwide event that increases awareness of civics and citizenship education in  Australian schools. 

 The Government is committed to making civics and citizenship education a vital part of  our schools. Since 1997, the Government has provided $35 million in funding to help  teachers and schools with civics and citizenship education. 

 School-based civics and citizenship education activities support basic democratic values  such as the rule of law, tolerance, acceptance of cultural diversity, respect for others,  and freedom of speech and religion - values that underpin the Australian way of life. 

 School activities for the week include: researching and commemorating Australian  soldiers who fought in the First World War; the What makes an Australian  citizenphotographic exhibition for new non-English speaking students; and establishing  community mentors to work with students on the values of tolerance, respect and  understanding.

 I was also pleased to join yesterday with thirty Year 10 and 11 students from around  Australia to participate in the Every Voice Counts! forum, addressing issues such as local,  regional and global citizenship.

 The Howard Government is strongly committed to ensuring that when students leave 

 school they have an understanding and appreciation of Australia’s system of government  and civic life.

 Attached is the list of schools who will receive a 2005 Celebrating Democracy Week grant  and the list of students at yesterday’s forum.

 Details of the schools receiving 2005 Celebrating Democracy Week grants are available  at http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/
