 While in Australia the High Commissioner will call on the  Governor-General and hold discussions with the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs  and officials from various Government departments.  He will also  meet with*non-government organisations involved in refugee 

 assistance programs.  In Sydney he will visit the Endeavour  Migrant Centre to meet newly arrived refugees.

In 1964 Mr Hartling became Chairman of the Liberal  Party, in 1968-71 Minister for Foreign Affairs and from 1973-75  Danish Prime Minister. Mr Hartling has been High Commissioner  since January 1978.
