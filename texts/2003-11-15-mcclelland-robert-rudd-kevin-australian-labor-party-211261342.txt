 Another day, another lie exposed   

 Another day, and another Howard Government lie is exposed in the Melville  Island affair.   

 The  Howard  Government  has  claimed  all  along  that  these  asylum-seekers   were sent back to Indonesia with the Indonesian Government’s cooperation.   

 Now Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa has stated:   

 “Agreement  was  not  sought,  nor  was  it  given  by  Indonesia,  to   the decision given by the Australian authority to basically expel  them out of Australia.”   

 “But  I  am  very  reluctant  to  use  the  term  (co-operation)  as  you   have  used  it  now,  because  it  may  construed  as  if  we  were   facilitating  the  return  of  these  people  back  to  Indonesia  and   then to be processed in Indonesia.”   

 “We hope that this latest episode would not make us go back to  the old pattern of trying to shift responsibilities here and there.”   

 (AAP, 14/11/03, 6.04pm)   

 As  well  as  lying  to  the  Australian  people,  the  Howard  Government  risks   fracturing our relationship with Jakarta in the fight against people-smugglers.   

 If that happens, the cost to Australia’ s border security will be huge and the  responsibility  will  lie  squarely  with  the  Howard  Government  over  its  deceitful   handling of the Melville Island affair.
