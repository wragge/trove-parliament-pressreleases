 Media Release 

 

 Hon. Arch Bevis MP  Federal Member for Brisbane  Shadow Minister for Homeland Security,  Aviation and Transport Security 

 12 April 2006   

 BORDER SECURITY 101: GOVERNMENT CANNOT  HANDLE BASICS OF BORDER SECURITY   

 “The Howard Government is a festival of ignorance and arrogance, and they lack the initiatives to 

 secure Australia’s borders against dangers”, Shadow Minister for Homeland Security Arch Bevis 

 said today.  

 

 “The Howard Government could not pass Border Security 101. In ten long years of the Howard 

 Government, our borders leak like a sieve. It might be breaking news to Senator Ellison and 

 Minister Nelson, but there were big issues in Australia’s border security before Papuan asylum 

 seekers.  

 

 “Last year alone there were 8,000 illegal vessels sighted in Northern Australia but there were only 

 280 apprehensions. Those 8,000 could be carrying illegal fishers, people smugglers, carrying 

 diseases or drugs, or terrorists. Illegal terrorist groups like Jemaah Islamiyah are known to operate 

 in the waters and islands to our immediate North to North-West.    

 

 “The Government’s recent announcement to provide only a little extra aerial surveillance is just 

 ridiculous. With more AP3 Orions flying over the Torres Strait we might sight 9,000 illegal 

 vessels instead of 8,000, but we will still catch only two or three hundred of them. Without a 

 Coastguard the Government still have no capacity to properly deal with this issue.   

 

 The Howard Government’s long term neglect of these border issues is confirmed by their policy 

 of  asking  Australian  commercial  fishing  boats  to  intercept  unauthorised  overseas  vessels.  The  

 solution is clear - we must have an Australian Coastguard. 

 

 “Today’s meeting of Cabinet’s National Security Committee should swallow its pride and adopt 

 Labor’s policy of establishing a Coastguard so that these problems can be finally addressed”, said 

 Arch Bevis.
