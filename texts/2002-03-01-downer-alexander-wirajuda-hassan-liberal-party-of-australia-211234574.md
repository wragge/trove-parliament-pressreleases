 AFGHANISTAN     AUSTRALIA     INDONESIA

 JOINT PRESS RELEASE

 Mr Alexander Downer, MP, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Hassan Wirajuda, Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs and His Excellency Abdul Rahim Karimi, Afghanistan Minister for Justice, in a meeting on 26 February, held during the Regional Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, urged the international community to work cooperatively to address the plight of Afghan refugees and displaced people.

 The Ministers deeply regretted the plight of Afghan refugees who, under pressure from the unfortunate circumstances created by the Taliban regime, were forced to leave their home country and seek refuge in neighbouring countries as well as the Asia-Pacific region.

 The Ministers agreed that one of the post-conflict issues which needed careful resolution was the voluntary return of Afghan refugees to Afghanistan.

 It would be important to seek a dignified solution for the voluntary return of Afghan refugees, said the Ministers.

 They agreed that developing effective and rational return arrangements for Afghan refugees and others would be an integral part of reducing the demand for the services of people smugglers.  Ministers agreed to work closely in developing those arrangements in the context of a comprehensive package, taking care of financial incentive, return, resettlement and rehabilitation.

 Ministers emphasised that the Regional Conference had highlighted the plight of Afghan refugees and provided political momentum for countries to assist in their voluntary return to Afghanistan.

 Agreement has been reached that Afghanistan will accept the immediate return of any Afghans not in need of protection who arrive through illegal means in Indonesia or Australia from now on.

 In order to further pursue the detailed arrangements and technical matters in this endeavour, the Ministers agreed to continue future talks and dialogue.
