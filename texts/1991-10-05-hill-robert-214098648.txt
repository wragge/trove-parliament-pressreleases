 MESSAGE FROM SENATOR ROBERT HILL. SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN   AFFAIRS. TO THF. CROATIAN INTERCOMMITTEE COUNCIL FOR NSW RALLY.   SYDNEY. 5 OCTOBER 1991. DELIVERED BY SENATOR MICHAEL BAUME.   SHADOW MINISTER FOR ARTS. HERITAGE. SPORT AND YOUTH AFFAIRS.

 The renewed offensive by the federal Yugoslav army against the   Croatian forces is to be condemned. The achievement of a lasting   peace must be made the highest priority and efforts to stop the   bloodshed need to be accelerated.

 The Liberal/National Coalition has consistently supported the   rights of the Croatian people for peaceful self-determination in   accordance with their wishes as expressed in democratic  

 plebiscites. .

 We have deplored attempts by the Yugoslav army to take control   of parts of Croatia. We have continually urged the Australian   Government to protest to the Yugoslav Government in the strongest   possible terms.

 On 6 A ugust, when aggression against Croatia intensified and the   role of the Yugoslav army became prominent, the Opposition called   for international intervention, including involvement of the   United Nations.

 On IS August 1991, the Opposition moved a motion in the Senate   condemning aggression against Croatia and calling upon the   Australian Government to recall the Australian Ambassador to   Belgrade for consultations on how support could be given to both  

 Slovenia and Croatia, including the most appropriate time to give   dip]omatic recognition. The Government opposed this motion, but   it was carried by the Senate with the support of Senator  

 Harradine (independent, Tasmania) and the Australian Democrats   on 22 August.

 The Opposition repeated its call for United Nations intervention   on 26 A u g u s t .  We welcomed the statement by the Prime Minister on   28 August that he may be willing to support United Nations  

 intervention. We continued to press for Government action until   this resulted in the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator E v ans,   formally addressing the United Nations and calling for Security   Council involvement.

 On 27 August,  the Opposition also called for Australian  

 Government action to give relief, via the International Committee   of the Red Cross in Geneva, to refugees created by the aggression   against Croatia. On 5 September,  the Australian Government   acceded to these calls with an announcement of $100,000 in relief

 to be supplied via the international Committee of the Red Cross.

 in addition, on 31 August, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr  Hewson, urged the Australian Government to provide humanitarian  support directly to Zagreb in the form of urgently needed medical  assistance. Dr Hewson also called for the urgent provision of  consular support in Zagreb so that Croatian people seeking  Australian visas no longer needed to apply through Belgrade.

 The Opposition is actively involved in trying to find 

 constructive and appropriate solutions to the problems in  Yugoslavia. Senator Hill met yesterday with European negotiators  in The Hague, where he expressed the grave concern of the 

 Australian community about the ongoing conflict.

 Senator Hill made strong representations to the negotiators  regarding the urgency of finding solutions to enable a peaceful  settlement, including possible United Nations involvement. He  canvassed a wide range of options anc^will be bringing the latest 

 information back with him from Europe. This is all the mure  important as the 8 October deadline for the declaration of  Croatia's independence is only two days away and appropriate  action needs to be taken. â 

 In addition, Paul riling, the Liberal member for Moore, is  currently in Croatia. As the Secretary of" "Parliamentarians for  Croatia and Slovenia", a Parliamentary friendship group, he has  been active in drawing attention to the ongoing conflict, and 

 will report back on his visit next week.

 The Liberal/National Coalition will continue to urge the 

 Australian Government to press within the United Nations for  endorsement of the principle that the republics of Yugoslavia be  allowed to determine their future in accordance with accepted  principles of self-determination and international law. No 

 legitimacy can be given to attempts to revise boundaries through  the use of force.

 We believe that the Australian Government and the international  community must explore all options which might contribute to the  ending of bloodshed, and allow the aspirations of Croatia for  independence to be achieved peacefully.
