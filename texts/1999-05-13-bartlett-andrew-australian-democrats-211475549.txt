  Refugee 
Inquiry to go ahead

  A parliamentary inquiry into 
the refugee program, proposed by the Australian Democrats, was agreed 
to today in the Senat  e.

  "The Democrats are keeping an open mind on the 
outcome, but we believe that widespread concerns about the operation 
of the refugee program must be properly examined  .  The Democrats want any 
flaws in the system ironed out," said the Democrats’ spokesperson 
for immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett. 

  "The Democrats are very pleased there is to 
be a full parliamentary inquiry into the Federal Government’s current 
practices as to the determination of refugee status." 

  The Democrats first formally recommended an inquiry 
three weeks ago joining calls by Amnesty International, the International 
Commission of Jurists and the Law Council.

  Senator Brian Harradine supported the inquiry after 
raising the case of a woman, who was allegedly deported and forced to 
have an abortion at 8½ months upon her return to China. This is one 
of a number of individual cases that will be examined by the Senate 
committee.

  The inquiry was also supported by the ALP, the greens 
and Senator Colston.

  The inquiry, to be conducted by the Legal and Constitutional 
References Committee, will report by the 18 October 1999.

  Matters to be examined in the 
refugee inquiry include: 

  â¢   the adequacy of legal assistance provided to asylum 
seekers under the Federal Government’s Immigration advice and Application 
Assistance Scheme; 

  â¢ the adequacy of a non-compellable, non-reviewable 
Ministerial discretion to ensure that no person is forcibly returned 
to a country where they face torture or death; 

  â¢ whether Australia’s treaty commitments to and 
obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugee, 
the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights are capable of being met given the fundamental 
principle of non-return to face torture or death is not present in domestic 
law nor subject to the rule of law; 

  â¢ the adequacy of current refugee determination 
procedures having regard to the role and function of the Refugee Review 
Tribunal in investigating asylum claims; 

  â¢ the importance of maintaining full judicial oversight 
of any administrative process that directly affects Australia’s compliance 
with its international legal obligations; 

  â¢ the potential implications for the future operation 
of Australia’s refugee policy and program following the enactment 
of the principle of providing temporary haven; 

  â¢ the recent case of the Chinese woman allegedly 
deported to China, despite pleas for protection, to face a forced abortion 
when 8½ months pregnant; 

  â¢ the accessibility of judicial review for impecunious 
asylum seekers, particularly since the removal of grants of aid for 
asylum seekers in all instances except in extremely limited circumstances; 

  â¢ the role and involvement of private contractors 
in removal processes; and 

  â¢ the processes which are in place for monitoring 
deportation cases once they have been returned to their country of origin.
