 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Pacific Strategy Success

 MPS 51/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced that the number of  voluntary returns from both Manus and Nauru has reached 419, with the departure of a further 30 people from Nauru last  week.

 'The return of those people unsuccessful in their asylum claims is an important element in the success of the Pacific Strategy,'  Mr Ruddock said.

 The latest group of voluntary returns, comprising 25 Afghans, 4 Iraqis and 1 Bangladeshi, ranging in age from 15 to 49,  departed Nauru on 23 July (Australian time) on a charter flight arranged by the International Organisation for Migration  (IOM). This leaves 404 people on the island. 

 Of the group, 18 people took advantage of the reintegration assistance package from the Australian Government, which  includes cash assistance of A$2,000 per person, or up to A$10,000 for a family unit comprising husband, wife and dependent  children. The others received some financial assistance from IOM.

 In addition to the voluntary returns, 721 refugees had been resettled from the Offshore Processing Centres in Manus and  Nauru to six countries (Australia, NZ, Sweden, Canada, Denmark and Norway).

 'I have agreed that the remaining refugees in the offshore processing facilities not being considered for resettlement in other  countries should be invited to complete applications for visas to Australia. This processing is under way,' Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister also announced the wind down of the offshore processing centre at the Lombrum Naval Base in Papua New  Guinea's Manus Province. The centre, managed by the IOM will be maintained in a secure state, ready to reactivate at short  notice.

 'Of the last three residents, two adult males from Iraq have been granted refugee status and are being resettled in Australia,  while the other man has been moved to Australia for medical treatment,' Mr Ruddock said.

 'The departure of the last residents from the Manus facility and the winding down of operations at the centre reinforces the  effect of our policies on the illegal movement of people by boat to Australia.'

 The current MOU with the Papua New Guinea Government runs until October this year and the future of the facility will be  considered by both governments closer to that time.
