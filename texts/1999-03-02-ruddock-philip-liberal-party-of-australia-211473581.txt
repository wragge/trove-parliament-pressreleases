  Minister in Queensland for   
immigration consultations

  

  MPS 38/99 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, today said initiatives to attract more skilled migrants to 
Australia were having a significant impact in Queensland. 

 In Brisbane as part 
of national consultations on Australia's 1999-2000 migration program, 
Mr Ruddock said the number of migrants coming to Queensland under the 
Skill stream increased by more than 13 per cent in 1997-98 over the 
previous year. 

 "The 1997-98   Settler Arrivals  
statistical report shows that 3,578 people migrated to the state through 
the Skill stream last year, up from 3,155 in 1996-97. 

 "In total, some 
15,095 migrants settled in Queensland in 1997-98 compared to 14,640 
the previous year. 

 "Queensland figures 
reflect the emphasis that the Government has placed on attracting skilled 
migrants, and our determination to deliver a balanced program. 

 "Australia is getting 
the expertise it needs, and the community can be confident the migration 
program is generating significantly more benefits for them. 

 "The Government 
is committed to ensuring that skilled migration to Australia continues 
to improve, so all Australians can share in these benefits." 

 Mr Ruddock said the   Settler Arrivals  
report also showed that: 

  During this year's consultations, M r Ruddock will meet with 
a wide cross-section of individuals and organisations including representatives 
of business, economic, industry, union, environment, welfare, planning, 
refugee, humanitarian and ethnic community groups. 

 Mr Ruddock will also 
host an open public meeting in Brisbane tonight at which any individual 
is able to attend and put their views on the size and composition of 
Australia's immigration program. 

 "This is the first 
time that a nation-wide round of public meetings has been held on the 
migration program. 

 "I trust this will 
provide a unique opportunity for many Australians to contribute their 
thoughts, ideas and comments on the size and composition of Australia's 
immigration program." 

  Consultations and public meetings are also being h eld in Melbourne, 
Griffith, Sydney, Albury-Wodonga, Perth, Canberra, Adelaide, Cairns 
and Darwin Launceston and Hobart.
