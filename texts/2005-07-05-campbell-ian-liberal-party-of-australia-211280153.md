 $725,000 to share Australia's stories

 â     A selection of sharing Australia's stories projects in each state

 The people, places, events and environments that have given Australia its distinctive national character  are being compiled into a series of stories, thanks to a new Australian Government grants programme.

 Australian Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, today announced $725,000  for the Sharing Australia's Stories programme to help bring 22 projects to life.

 The stories are rich and varied - interpretive signage and displays through the Greater Blue Mountains,  one of Australia's most botanically diverse regions; a website on the lives and work of architects Walter  Burley Griffin and Marion Mahoney Griffin; an exhibition detailing the experiences of Jewish refugees  in Victoria from 1933-1944 and a book exploring the impact of European settlement on indigenous  Australians - to name just a few.

 Senator Campbell said almost 1000 applications were received for the three-year programme, established  last year to help individuals, community groups and local government showcase their contribution to  Australia's natural and cultural character.

 "The popularity of the program far exceeded our expectations," Senator Campbell said. "From these we  have chosen a diverse range of stories that will now be shared with the broader Australian public through  grants up to $50,000.

 "These stories will be presented in different ways - heritage trails, internet sites, books, CDs, radio  programmes, videos, on-line and physical exhibitions, displays, oral histories, brochures, signage and  audio documentaries. The projects are innovative and will add to what will become a national gallery  celebrating our natural and cultural heritage."

 Sharing Australia's Stories will pay tribute to some of Australia's greatest heroes and sportsmen,  particularly Sir Donald Bradman, with $50,000 to expand the Australian Cricket Captains Walk in  Cootamundra and funding to establish the Don Bradman Heritage Trail.

 The Australian Government will also contribute $50,000 to a virtual memorial that will commemorate  the 645 lives lost in World War II on the HMAS Sydney and help solve the mystery of its location.

 "I am delighted by the diversity of these projects and what they tell us about our national character,"  Senator Campbell said.
