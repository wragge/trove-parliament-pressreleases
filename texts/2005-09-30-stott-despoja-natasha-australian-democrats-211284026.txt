 QLD youth divided on teens in adult prisons: Poll

 Queensland youth are divided on their Governments incarceration of young people in  adult prisons, Senator Natasha Stott Despojas annual Youth Poll survey has  revealed. Senator Stott Despoja said 47% of Queensland Youth Poll respondents do not  support this measure.  "Many Queensland respondents reject the idea of 17 year-olds being imprisoned with  adults," Senator Stott Despoja said.  This years Youth Poll also revealed that suicide remains a tragedy in young peoples  lives, with more than half of respondents knowing someone who had attempted or  committed suicide. Other major issues for young people this year include: increased university fees  (65% say increased HECS fees will discourage them from attending university);  reconciliation (71% believe the Government should enter into a treaty with  Indigenous Australians); and, access to contraception (80% want young people to  have access to free birth control).  "A significantly higher percentage of respondents than last year (60% compared to  42%) do not support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  "For more than a decade, Youth Poll has provided young people with a forum to  express their views on a range of topics.  "Through Youth Poll, young peoples views are publicised in the media and reported  to Parliament," Senator Stott Despoja said. Other State specific findings include: an overwhelming 85% of respondents from  New South Wales do not support a night curfew for young P-plated drivers; 74% of  South Australian respondents do not support the impounding of cars playing loud  music or doing burnouts; and, 71% of ACT respondents believe there are not enough  services for young people in their Territory.
