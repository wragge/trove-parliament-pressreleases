 MEDIA STATEMENT Philip Ruddock MP Federal Member for Dundas  Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

 AT LAST

 The announcement today that six Chinese boat people and one child have been  removed from Australia is welcome.

 Now, after two and half years, 7 of the 400 or so asylum seekers have been  processed through all stages of application, decision, review and deportation. It is  outrageous that it has taken this long for all those processes to be completed and for  large numbers of people still to be held in detention awaiting completion of all  formalities.

 In addition some 23,000 asylum seekers have lodged applications and the enormity  of that crisis has not yet been acknowledged by Government decision to expedite and  conclude processing arrangements.

 It has been the failure of the Government to effectively control the refugee  determination process that has brought about this extraordinarily high number of  applications. Hopefully the commencement of the deportation of non bona-fide  refugee claimants will repair the damage been done as a result of two and a half  years of indecision, argument and a flawed framework of law.

 The Opposition has pledged co-operation in effecting a speedy passage of the long  promised amendments to these procedures but to date even that legislation has not  yet been introduced into Parliament.

 In office the Opposition would acknowledge the enormity of the present crisis. The  Opposition would -

 . reallocate resources for expeditious processing

 . contain repetitive applications for review particularly in the courts

 . eliminate access to review without leave requiring applicants to establish they had  substantial claims that needed further consideration.

 Genuine refugees of course require on-going protection. The Opposition has always  maintained a strong commitment to assist genuine refugees.
