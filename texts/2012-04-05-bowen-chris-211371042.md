 15th boat since Tony Abbott said 'No' Thursday, 05 April 2012

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister  for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence  Materiel

 The asylum seeker boat intercepted this evening is the 15th since  Tony Abbott said 'no' to offshore processing and chose personal  political interest over the national interest.

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP,  and Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest boat  — carrying 71 people — showed that asylum seekers would  continue to risk their lives at sea without a genuine deterrent such  as the Malaysia Arrangement.

 'The consequence of Tony Abbott's relentless negativity is there for  all to see — the government has always said that without a real  deterrent the boats would continue to arrive,' Mr Bowen said.

 'This latest boat is a sad reminder of Mr Abbott's political  calculation that more boat arrivals are in his best political interest  — despite the national interest, despite the risk to life.'

 Mr Clare urged the Coalition and Tony Abbott to stop saying no  and work with the government to stop people risking their lives and  dying at sea.   

 'We can help to stop people from risking their lives by taking this  dangerous journey, but that requires Mr Abbott to stop saying no,'  Mr Clare said.

 'It's time Tony Abbott stopped saying no and voted to allow  offshore processing in Malaysia and Nauru.'
