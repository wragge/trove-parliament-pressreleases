 EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS ANNOUNCED FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA

 Emergency Relief Agencies throughout the State will receive  grants totalling $734,000 from the Emergency Relief Program,   the Federal Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services,  Peter Staples announced today.

 Forty four agencies will receive funding for the 1990-91  financial year.

 Mr Staples said, "the program aims are to provide emergency  financial help to people in crisis and to focus on those in  the community who are most needy, such as low income families  and single parents.

 He emphasised that along with helping the very needy, the  selection of emergency relief agencies is designed to assist  those who are specially disadvantaged, such as Aboriginal  people and people from non-English speaking backgrounds.

 Under the Emergency Relief Program, grants are made to  community and welfare agencies to provide financial  assistance to individuals and families in times of financial  crisis.

 Assistance is usually in the form of cash or vouchers for  immediate needs such as food, electricity, gas or rent.

 Approval of grants is based on the advice of the South  Australian Emergency Relief, State Advisory Committee.

 The committee takes into account such matters as regional  needs and the suitability of agencies to manage emergency  relief funds when making its recommendations to the Minister.

 This year the Federal Government is providing $ 7.6 million  to agencies throughout Australia for emergency relief  payments.

 A list of approved grants to agencies is attached.
