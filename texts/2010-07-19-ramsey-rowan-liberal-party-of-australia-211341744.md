 ROWAN RAMSEY MP  Member for Grey   

 

 Local Initiatives Will Be Impacted by   Mismanagement of National Economy    

 The mismanagement of the national economy will continue to impact on our ability to deliver the  assistance needed to build water infrastructure, hospitals and provide jobs for our youth Federal  Member for Grey Rowan Ramsey said today.   

 Mr Ramsey said the Labor Government’s mismanagement of the Australian economy has left the  country saddled with a staggering $100billion debt.   

 “Julia Gillard’s Government is still borrowing $700million a week after massively mismanaging the  home insulation program, the Green Loans program, the computers in schools program and the Julia  Gillard memorial halls program,” he said.   

 “The waste through sheer incompetence is staggering with the latter two programs the full  responsibility of the Prime Minister who was education minister with complete oversight of the  school halls program which has evolved into well-documented fiasco and the school computers  program which is now under investigation.”   

 Mr Ramsey said in opposition he has fought hard to achieve ground with the Youth Allowance back-down, the back down by Government of its plans to kill-off country cataract surgery, the back down  on beef imports and an extension of the school chaplaincy program.  “A Liberal Government would achieve through strong policy direction and strong economic  management to cut the waste,” he said.  “This Government has been flopping from one program to another in poll-driven attempts at  retaining popularity.  “We have had the massive turnaround with asylum seekers, a problem created by the Government,  and the back down on the Resource Super Profit Tax.  “It should be remembered that without Liberal intervention we would now have in place a $20  billion tax on the mining industry which would be crippling to jobs in this electorate.  “Clearly Australia cannot afford another three years of mismanagement under a Julia Gillard Labor  Government. Locally we need to focus on our water systems, health, the delivery of services to the  aged and disabled and school attendance as a real solution to alleviating indigenous and non-indigenous disadvantage.  “I will continue to pursue an MRI machine for the region and an alternative to the desalination plant  proposed for the top of the gulf.”
