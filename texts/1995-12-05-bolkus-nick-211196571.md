  GENDER GUIDELINES FOR REFUGEE AND HUMANITARIAN APPLICATIONS 

  Guidelines will be developed for the sensitive handling of  applications by women for humanitarian entry to â‘ and refugee  status in Australia, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, announced today. . 

  "The Federal Government has a long standing commitment to refugee  women, and is well aware of how their gender can make them  especially vulnerable to violence, abuse and discrimination,"  senator Bolkus said. "Australia was one of the first countries  to introduce a humanitarian resettlement program specifically for  refugee women and their dependants - the Woman at Risk program. 

  "I am keen to improve my department's services to women, and was  pleased to give the united Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  a commitment to develop formal guidelines for Australian decision  makers handling their refugee and humanitarian applications. 

  "The guidelines will sensitise the refugee process, bothâ‘ on and  offshore, to their special needs and concerns." 

  The guidelines will cover: 

  Procedural issues, to ensure that sensitive consideration is  given to women applicants, particularly victims of sexual abuse;  to ensure that female spouses of applicants have the opportunity  to make separate claims; that departmental officers are  culturally sensitive and show respect for family relationships,  and that wherever possible same sex officers and interpreters are  used, particularly when cases involve claims of a sexual nature. 

  The guidelines will also offer guidance on issues of gender  persecution in assessing applications, which takes account of the  fact that persecution can be experienced differently by women  than by men. 

  The Guidelines for stay in Australia on Humanitarian Grounds will  be revised to include gender issues among the circumstances for  the exercise of Ministerial discretion. 

  Finally, the department will consult with a range of relevant  organisations, including the UNHCR and the Refugee Council of  Australia on the development of the guidelines, and a training  strategy to implement them and sensitise decision makers to  gender issues, including issues of cultural awareness and torture 

  and trauma.â‘ 

  The guidelines are expected to be finalised early next year.
