 Offshore Processing Developments and Related Savings

 MPS 33/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today confirmed the Government's intention to continue sending a strong signal to people smugglers and their clients.

 The Minister has outlined ongoing funding for offshore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals in the 2002-03 Budget. These measures are part of the enhanced border control initiative, which is one of the themes of the 2002-03 Federal Budget delivered by the Treasurer.

 Mr Ruddock said the Budget provides funding for the ongoing processing of asylum seekers at offshore locations.

 "We know that the smugglers' inability to deliver their clients to the Australian mainland has had a significant impact on their operations and it is important that we stand firm," Mr Ruddock said.

 The budget includes four year funding for the operational costs of offshore processing, which includes:

 $129.3m for 2002-03 for the offshore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals at offshore locations in third countries; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $81.9 million in 2002-03 for offshore processing at Christmas Island and, if necessary, Cocos Island; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the Budget also includes $153.7 million over two years for construction costs and $34.4 million in commissioning and operating expenses over four years for the new purpose built centre on Christmas Island (announced on 12 March 2002).

 Mr Ruddock said the implementation of offshore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals has led to a significant reduction in costs for onshore processing in 2002-03 and the forward estimate years.

 The savings are estimated at some $350 million over the four years.

 In an earlier announcement, Mr Ruddock outlined a long-term strategy for onshore immigration facilities, including the planned mothballing of the Curtin Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC) and the scaling down of the Woomera IRPC.

 Funding of $3.4 million over four years to support this initiative is also provided in the 2002-03 Budget.
