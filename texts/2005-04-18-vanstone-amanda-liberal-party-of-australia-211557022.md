 Australia’s Humanitarian Commitment Holds Firm

 VPS 053/2005

 The Australian Government will maintain the Humanitarian Program at 13 000 new places in 2005-06, Minister for Immigration, Amanda  Vanstone, announced today.

 ‘The decision in 2004 to invest almost $270 million over four years to fund a 50 per cent increase in the refugee component of the Program from  4000 to 6000 places and expand settlement services for 7000 humanitarian entrants has received strong support from the community,’ Senator  Vanstone said. 

 In 2005-06 the Program will provide 6000 places for the resettlement of refugees referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) and 7000 places for the Special Humanitarian Program and protection visas in Australia. 

 ‘Importantly, 10.5 per cent of the refugee category will continue to be allocated to Women at Risk and their families. We will also increase  humanitarian settlement in suitable regional areas,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our priority will continue to be Africa, followed by the Middle East and South West Asia - reflecting the resettlement priorities of the UNHCR.

 ‘The program outcome in 2003-04 was the highest in eight years, with 13 851 visas granted of which 85 per cent were granted offshore,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘I would like to express my gratitude to the community members, non government organisations and UNHCR who have been involved in the  consultation process helping us identify those in greatest need of resettlement.

 ‘All Australians can be justifiably proud of our humanitarian program, which costs about $500 million each year. Australia ranks alongside the US  and Canada in the world's top three permanent resettlement countries, and is one of only 10 countries worldwide offering a new life and a new  home through resettlement annually.

 ‘It is because of our commitment to border protection and deterring people smugglers that we are able to offer these opportunities to people  offshore. 

 ‘It is important to remember that every time an individual arrives in Australia unlawfully either on a boat or a plane and is assessed as being in  need of resettlement, someone in a refugee camp in Africa or elsewhere misses out.

 Since the end of World War II more than six million migrants have come to Australia. Over 635 000 of them arrived under humanitarian programs. 

 ‘I am gratified by the support the Australian community has extended to humanitarian entrants over many decades which is helping these people to  rebuild their lives,’ Senator Vanstone said.
