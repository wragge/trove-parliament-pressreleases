  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  256.06 Wednesday, 8 November 2006 

  October refugee and humanitarian arrivals to Australia  During the past month Australia has welcomed more than a thousand refugee and  humanitarian entrants among those most in need of resettlement, Minister for Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone said today. 

  The 101 0 refugee and humanitarian entrants who arrived in October settled across  Australia as follows: 

  New South Wales 300 Western Australia 108  Victoria 254 Tasmania 42 

  South Australia 163 Northern Territory 14 

  Queensland 124 ACT 5 

  “Of these arrivals, 527 were refugees, many of whom have been waiting in refugee camps  for years,” Senator Vanstone said today. 

  Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of  resettlement. 

  The remaining 483 people were Special Humanitarian Programme (SHP) entrants. They  were forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination.  They also have family or other links with Australia. 

  Included in the 101 0 arrivals were 553 people from Africa, 372 people from the Middle  East and South West Asia, 82 people from South East Asia, two people from North East  Asia, and one person from South America. 

  Senator Vanstone said 33 family groups within the October arrivals (a total of  104 people) were granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk. 

  “These are women and their dependents who have lost male family members and are  therefore particularly vulnerable,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  “All October arrivals entered Australia under the Government’s refugee and humanitarian  programme that provides 13,000 places each year. 

  ”Australia is able to offer protection to so many people, in part, because of our commitment  to maintaining tough border security.”
