 Govt help needed to combat NT youth drinking: Poll

 Many young Northern Territorians want Government assistance to break alcohols  insidious grip on their lives, Senator Natasha Stott Despojas annual Youth Poll has  revealed. Senator Stott Despoja said the results show that young people recognise the  destructive effects of excessive alcohol consumption. "Many young people in the Northern Territory are seeing the harmful effects of binge  drinking on themselves and their friends and want to do something about it," Senator  Stott Despoja said.  The poll also found that more than half of the respondents know someone who had  attempted or committed suicide. "This Poll shows young Australians are confronting very serious issues. It also  reveals that they are looking to State and Federal governments for leadership in  dealing with these problems." Other major issues for young people this year include: increased university fees  (65% say increased HECS fees will discourage them from attending university);  reconciliation (71% believe the Government should enter into a treaty with  Indigenous Australians); and, access to contraception (80% want young people to  have access to free birth control).  "A significantly higher percentage of respondents than last year (60% compared to  42%) do not support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  "For more than a decade, Youth Poll has provided young people with a forum to  express their views on a range of topics.  "Youth Poll promotes young peoples views in the media gives them a voice in  Parliament," Senator Stott Despoja said. This years State specific findings include: an overwhelming 85% of respondents from  New South Wales do not support a night curfew for young P-plated drivers; and, 74%  of South Australian respondents do not support the impounding of cars playing loud  music or doing burnouts.
