 South Australia Proving a Gem for Settlers

 With its winery dotted landscape, more than 6300 migrant and refugee entrants found South Australia a gem of a state to live in.

 It is a massive increase of more than 1500 people on last year’s total of 4773 and is the most migrant and refugee entrants under this Coalition  Government.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, with largest  number of people settling in South Australia coming from the United Kingdom followed by New Zealand, China, India and Sudan.

 Senator Vanstone said the number was an increase of almost 60 per cent on the 3700 settlers in 19949-95.

 On the national front, more than 123 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2004-05, up 40 per cent annually on the 1994-95 figures.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
