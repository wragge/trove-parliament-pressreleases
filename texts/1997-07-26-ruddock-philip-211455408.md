  Unlawful arrivals sent back to Sri Lanka  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today 15 people who  arrived in Australia unlawfully by boat had been returned to Sri Lanka at the weekend. 

  The group left Australia aboard a charter aircraft on Friday and arrived at Colombo on Saturday. 

  The group of 15 males arrived at Coral Bay, near Exmouth in Western Australia, three weeks ago. 

  "These people did not engage Australia's protection obligations and so, have been sent back home,"  Mr Ruddock said. 

  "The Australian Government has no desire to keep unauthorised arrivals in detention for any longer  than is necessary and this is evidenced by the quick and effective removal of a group of people who  have no claim to be in Australia ." 

  The group, which had been held at the Immigration Reception and Processing Centre at Port Hedland  since arriving in Australia , was returned to Sri Lanka, accompanied by Immigration officials and  Australian Protective Service staff. 

  The weekend removals follow the return of 92 unlawful arrivals to China two weeks ago and brings  to 383 the number of unauthorised boat arrivals removed from Australia in the past 12 months.
