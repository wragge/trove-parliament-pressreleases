 Australia Helps Afghanistan Fight Drought Upheaval MPS 076/2000

 Australia's Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today in Paris announced a drought relief assistance program worth $1.7 million for Afghanistan.

 The program will provide food aid to help stem the number of people trying to escape the affect of the drought by leaving their homes and entering neighbouring countries.

 "The Australian Government is very concerned about the humanitarian crisis emerging as a result of Afghanistan's worst drought in 30 years and the numbers of people from Afghanistan entering Iran, Pakistan and other countries, placing additional pressure on services in those nations," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister said the United Nations coordinator for Afghanistan estimates that half of Afghanistan's 25 million people will be affected by the drought over the next 12 months. With winter rain and snowfall considerably lower than average, less water was available. As a result, access to drinking water in both urban and rural areas was becoming increasingly difficult.

 Mr Ruddock said Australia would contribute $1.7 million to the World Food Programme to help provide food and water to people in Afghanistan.

 "This assistance will help people stay in their own home regions, and discourage the movement of people to cities in Afghanistan and into neighbouring Pakistan, Iran and beyond," Mr Ruddock said.

 An estimated 1.4 million Afghanistan refugees are already in Iran and 1.2

 million in Pakistan.

 The $1.7 million drought relief assistance program follows the allocation in June 2000 of $1.5 million from the Australian Government's overseas aid program to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to increase self-reliance of refugees in Iran and Pakistan.

 The aid to Afghanistan will be administered by AusAID, the international aid agency of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
