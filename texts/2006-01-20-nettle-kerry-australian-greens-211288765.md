 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has this afternoon received reports from West Papua that  four people have been shot just hours ago by Battalion 753 of the Indonesian army.    

 "I am advised that these four shootings occurred near Paniai - the same area that some of the  West Papua boat people who arrived in Australia this week were from.    

 "I am concerned that the Australian Government allowed Indonesian officials access to the West  Papuan asylum seekers yesterday. I hope these two matters are not related and am calling on the  matter to be investigated.    

 "I hope the TNI is not engaging in reprisals against the West Papuan population for seeking  asylum in Australia.    

 "I am also advised that one of the four, Moses Douw later died at the Enarotali health clinic while  two others believed to be in critical condition, worsened by beatings by the TNI, are being flown to  Timika for treatment.    

 "If these reports are true, they add a whole lot of strength to the West Papuan's impending claims  for asylum," Senator Nettle said.
