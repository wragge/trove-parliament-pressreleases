  FUNDING TO HELP YOUNG HOMELESS IN SYDNEY 

  V162196 14 November 1996 

  Senator Amanda Vanstone, Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, today  announced a grant of $72,500 to Mission Employment Campbelltown for the establishment of a Job  Placement, Employment and Training programme, JPET, a programme for young people who are  homeless or at risk of homelessness. 

  This funding is part of $22 million to be provided nationally over the next two years.  \ 

  "Mission Employment Campbelltown is one of eight services funded as the first step in the  nation-wide re-establishment of JPET", Senator Vanstone said. "The Federal Government has placed  a high priority on youth issues, and we are committed to providing assistance to young people who  face barriers so they can reach their full potential. 

  "In the lead up to the election the Coalition promised to re-establish the successful JPET programme  and provide $11 million a year in funding for the next two years. We are delivering on this promise  today. 

  "JPET will provide an individually targeted and flexible approach to assisting homeless young people.  Services are designed to help any young person who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless,  with priority being given to those aged 15-19. 

  "Other at risk groups, such as refugees, ex offenders , wards of the State or those exiting wardship  may also get help from JPET. Th~y do not need to be homeless. 

  itA wide range of advice, support and referral services is offered to jobseekers to assist with  accommodation, finances, staying at school, training and employment, self esteem, family mediation,  drug and alcohol rehabilitation . 

  Sydney City Mission JPET will aim to achieve full open market employment for young homeless  people through the provision of employment, work placement and training programs which are linked  to appropriate accommodation, support and related services , using an individual casework approach. 

  The centre will offer appropriate support for participants, employers and trainers and provide post  program support where as appropriate for young people as they look for employment. 

  "I am pleased disadvantaged young people from the Campbelltown area will be provided with a  flexible , individualised service to help them get back on track," Senator Vanstone said.
