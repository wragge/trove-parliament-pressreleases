 Indonesia : Bilateral Talks Needed

 The Australian Government must instigate bilateral talks with the Indonesian Government to heal the rift  over West Papua, according to the Australian Democrats.   

 "The recent arrivals of asylum-seekers demonstrate the ongoing problems faced by the province and the  need for a firm commitment to resolution for all parties," Democrats' Foreign Affairs Spokesperson  Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said.   

 "Australia, as a leader in the region, should seek talks to discuss the continuing unrest and human rights  abuses and make it clear that ignoring the problem will not make it go away.   

 "The best relationships are characterised by frank, open and honest discussions and the West Papuan  issue demands such talks. I hope this will characterise any meetings between the Government and  visiting delegations.   

 "The continuing human rights problems in Papua and the discrimination against Indigenous Papuans  must enter the dialogue.   

 "In 2001, Indonesia passed progressive autonomy laws for Papua, these laws have never been realised  because the military and ultra-nationalists have undermined these laws and hence have undermined the  Papuans right to be free from oppression and poverty.   

 "It is crucial for Indonesian practices in Papua to be transparent. Bans on the entry of foreign media and  NGOs into Papua must be lifted.   

 "A lesson can be learnt from the recent events in Aceh. The Aceh peace deal, which will have long term  beneficial effects for Indonesia, only eventuated when international intervention ended the militarised  nature of Aceh enabling a peace deal.   

 "Papua needs the international community's assistance for a peaceful solution to this conflict in our  region," Senator Stott Despoja said.
