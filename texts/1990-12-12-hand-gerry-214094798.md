 CAMBODIAN 'BOAT PEOPLE' TO REMAIN IN PRESENT LOCATIONS FOR  TIME BEING

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, announced today that his Department  had abandoned plans to establish a holding centre for  Cambodian "boat people" at mining company premises in Port  Hedland, W.A.

 Mr Hand said unforeseen difficulties had arisen in lease :   negotiations for the property selected â€”  the single  persons'  quarters of the Mt Newman Mining Company, at Cooke  Point. -

 The decision was also based on the continuing need for legal  support groups to have easy access to the Cambodians while  their applications for refugee status are progressed. .

 Mr Hand said the Cambodians who, as unauthorised arrivals,  must be kept in custody until their future is decided, would  remain at their present locations in Sydney, Melbourne and :   Darwin while the Department reassessed options for a holding 

 centre at other locations.

 (Twenty-six Cambodians are at the Westbridge Migrant Centre,  Sydney; 119 are at the Enterprise Migrant Hostel, Melbourne;~  and the remaining 79 are at a YHA Hostel in Darwin.) ...
