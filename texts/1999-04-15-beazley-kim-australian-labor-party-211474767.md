  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, BURWOOD COUNCIL CHAMBERS, 
15 APRIL 1999

  

 E&OE-PROOF ONLY

  

  Subjects: Sydney hail storm, GST, factions, ALP policy formation

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, first of all, just on last night’s storm. 
I believe you flew in to see some of the action?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Yes we had a horrendous sound and light show at one 
stage as we circled over Sydney for more than half an hour. And, of 
course, we were caught on the ground and we had to stand for about 45 
minutes before we could actually dock. Then after we docked, it was 
an hour and a half before baggage was removed. It was what you might 
describe reasonably as chaos at the airport. But, having driven through 
the city, that was nothing compared to the chaos everywhere else. It 
has been a truly horrendous event.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Today’s Shadow Cabinet meeting, what are the points 
of discussion....?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 It’s a normal Shadow Cabinet meeting, so we’ll 
have a number of items on the agenda. We will be discussing further 
the direction of our campaign of the goods and services tax and we will 
taking a bit of a further look at the situation in Kosovo and the Australian 
response to the circumstances of the refugees from Kosovo, it will be 
a matter we’ll be giving consideration to, then the normal bread and 
butter activity associated with a Shadow Cabinet meeting. But it’s 
been useful for me to hear the opinions of local authorities on a goods 
and services tax which will feature in my discussion. The Mayor of Burwood 
and associated councillors were good enough to point out to me what 
a devastating effect a goods and services tax is going to have on their 
operations.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 On a goods and services tax, would a Labor Government 
keep the tax, or amend it?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 We’re in the business of defeating this tax. And 
we are deadly serious about it. We’re not in the business of tinkering 
with the Government’s proposal so that the Democrats and others can 
comfortably sit down and put some sort of compromise through. We are 
going to hold the minor parties... .as far as a goods and services tax 
is concerned. Because we know this, as I said clearly in the election 
campaign, that if something like this gets in, it becomes practically 
impossible to remove it. Now matter what the legalities, it is practically 
impossible to remove. Everybody adjusts their recording systems in their 
companies to handle it. A set of taxes go, to be replaced by the goods 
and services tax. You’ve got Commonwealth/State financial arrangements 
agreed to. Therefore we have a one shot in the locker chance of stopping 
this and that’s in the Senate, and that’s what we’re going to 
try to do.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Business is now telling the Government that it could 
be made fairer if compensation is increased. Do you think it could be 
made fairer?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, business is in retreat on this. Business has 
now had exposed to it the reality of this GST. And they’ve had a chance 
to hear from rank and file business, if you like, particularly in the 
small business sector, and they’ve given it heaps. So, the business 
consultative groups have tended to be a little bit more flexible than 
they were when they initially put out their support for a goods and 
services tax. The problem is you can’t make it fair. The problem is 
you shift a substantial proportion of Australian taxes to indirect taxes 
which are borne mainly by families and by low income people. How can 
you make a system like that fair? You can’t. That’s why we say all 
that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, Bob Carr has called for an end to factional 
infighting in the ALP. Do you support that call?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I was interested in Bob’s comments. He’s made 
some good comments. We have different layers of problems if you like 
in relation to this. Our system produced for me the finest crop of the 
youngest, the most female crop of candidates that we’ve ever run federally 
and I think, arguably, the best backbench in living memory. They all 
came through the current system. I think one of the difficulties that 
Bob Carr specifically had in NSW was actually a product of what I perceive 
as a giant breakdown of the faction system around Australia and the 
extent to which the factions here at the State level in NSW have.., 
which has created a degree of problem for them. And he is, as he said, 
chipping away, point by point on that. What I would love to see happen, 
and it has to happen, basically, at the State level around Australia, 
is that even more ... in Labor Party membership. We are the only serious 
political party left nationally now with a genuine rank and file participation. 
And you could see that at the last election when the Liberal Party had 
to pay for most of their help. And we ought to honour that by giving 
the rank and file in the Labor Party as big a say as possible. And I’m 
going to have a few views on that in Western Australia over the course 
of the next few months.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But at the Federal level you’re saying the factional 
system is worth hanging on to?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, at the Federal level it’s never been as intense, 
it’s been intense enough, but not as intense and as divided as it 
is at the State level. And we all actually tend to get on in the Federal 
Party, there’s a lot of what you might call cross-factional affinity. 
So, we have to look at this situation on a State by State basis. A solution 
in one State could create a problem in another if you tried to impose 
it universally to each of them.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What about his call to broaden the support base away 
from just trade union members and to incorporate small business and 
medium size business owners and operators?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, we understand that we have to always broaden 
to survive. The Labor Party has not been bad at that over the years, 
but we’ve not done all that well amongst small businesses. I think 
you’re going to find that change, particularly it will change if the 
GST goes into effect because small business will carry the administrative 
burden of it. Now don’t take that by any means to suggest that we 
want this GST to go through - we don’t, we want to stop it. It’s 
very bad for our people. But there are opportunities out there now to 
restore the Labor Party base. Bob Carr took most of them at the last 
State election.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 You have called, though, for a process of policy renewal. 
When is that really going to get happening?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 It is happening. I mean, you saw actually the product 
of it last week with the white paper that we produced on drugs which 
was far more comprehensive, unfortunately, than the discussion that 
emerged at the Premiers’ Conference. So, that was a product of it. 
You’ve also seen a few ideas put forward by myself about what were 
to be the fundamental underpinnings of a knowledge based society. We 
are trying to shift the Australian agenda and we’ve put a few things 
into place to do that. We want to shift it off what is essentially a 
sterile discussion about the balance between taxation on expenditure 
and taxation on income, over to a real agenda and that is about the 
skilling of the Australian people and the innovation in Australian business 
and the character of the Australian population. These are the critical 
issues and it’s around these issues that our policy review process 
is taking place.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 So, you’re talking about education, job creation, 
new initiatives?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Education, job creation, funding innovation of Australian 
business, research and development. These things that make up an intelligent 
community. Jobs are being driven in this country now at the low knowledge 
intensity level. Successful countries now are those who receive the 
bulk of their job creation in the knowledge intensive industries. Those 
are countries like the United States, and Germany and countries in Europe. 
This, now, does not have much impact on us but in four or five years 
from now if that pattern continues it will be disastrous.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Just on Jeff Kennett’s preamble, leaving mateship 
and God out, is that a wise move?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 When are these people going to be able to focus on 
the simple historical fact that the Aboriginal community had original 
custodianship of the land? Of all the people in the Liberal Party, I 
thought wouldn’t squib that point I thought it would be Jeff Kennett, 
but I was disappointed. He squibbed it. And then the rest of Jeff Kennett’s 
stuff, while obviously better than John Howard’s - but that’s not 
hard to do - is just all late I 990s Liberal Party-speak, you know, 
about the frontiers, about the lifestyles, about the choices. This is 
not the language of a Constitutional preamble. It’s got to be taken 
out of the hands of the Liberal Party main speech makers and handed 
over to the Australian people. And we’ve said the most sensible way 
to do that is to get a collective operation going between a joint Parliamentary 
committee and the elected representatives at last years Constitutional 
Convention. You’ll get something quite good out of that if you hand 
it over to them.
