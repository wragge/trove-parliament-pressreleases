 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 44,000 ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS  UNDER LABOR June 14, 2013

 The arrival of the latest four illegal boats, with a total of over 260 people on board, has brought to over 44,000 the number of  people  to  have  arrived  illegally  by  boat  on  Labor’s  watch,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “The surge in illegal arrivals under Labor’s failed border protection policies, including 13 boats in the last week, is bringing an average of over 100 people to Australia illegally a day and over 3,000 a month,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “This year has already seen more than 12,000 illegal boat arrivals, almost three times higher than over the same period last year - which was the all-time record for boats.

 “These continuing record arrivals will mean Labor will just create a bigger mess as they push their border protection failure onto the states and territories courtesy of their no care, no responsibility bridging visa dumping policy.

 “It was revealed this week that Victorian police and health services have written to the Prime Minister outlining concern for the  significant  impact  her  community  dumping  policy  is  having  on  their  operations.  This  is  a  mess  that  Labor  should address immediately, not pass the buck on.

 “It’s incumbent upon the Labor Government to be responsible for the effects of their border failure rather than burying their head in the sand and pretending that their border failures have no consequences.

 “This is just another reason why the Coalition will, if elected, reinstate proven policies to stop the boats and stop the cost, chaos and tragedy occurring on our borders,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “These four latest illegal boat arrivals carrying a collective 264 people are set to add further strain to a  border protection system that is already struggling under the weight of Labor’s incompetent management of our borders.

 “Using the Prime Minister’s own terminology, the Australian people have now witnessed 722 boat arrivals, or ‘policy  failures’, under this Government, carrying a total of 44,159 people.

 “We have how seen more people arrive than would fit into the Sydney Cricket Ground, which has an official capacity of  44,002 people.

 “Considering one of the boats made it all the way to Broome yesterday, there are no signs that the boats will slow under  this Government - the people smugglers know a good product when they see it,” Mr Keenan said.
