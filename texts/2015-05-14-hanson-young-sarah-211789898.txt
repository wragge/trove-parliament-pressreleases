 MEDIA RELEASE   

 

 Thursday 14 May 2015   

 

 IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS ADRIFT AT SEA   

 

 The Australian Greens have called upon the Abbott Government to provide immediate  technical, financial and humanitarian assistance to the reported 8,000 Rohingyan asylum  seeking refugees currently adrift in South-East Asian seas.    

 “The UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration have called for an international  search and rescue mission to save the asylum seekers and Australia is best placed to provide  such assistance, Greens spokesperson for Immigration Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said   

 “Australia must do everything we can to help in this urgent search and rescue operation.  Turning a blind eye is simply not acceptable.   

 “The asylum seekers,  many suffering from starvation, are in desperate need of assistance and  Australia, as a regional leader, has an international responsibility to provide leadership and  provide immediate assistance.
