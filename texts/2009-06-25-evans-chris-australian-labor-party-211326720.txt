 Detention values to be enshrined in law 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today introduced  a Bill to enshrine in law measures that prohibit the detention of children in detention  centres and ensure people don't languish in detention for years on end. 

 The Migration Amendment (Immigration Detention Reform) Bill 2009 will give  legislative effect to the Rudd Government's New Directions in Detention policies  announced in July last year. 

 The Bill embeds in law the principle that people are detained based on the risk they  pose and held in an immigration detention centre for the shortest practicable time.  The Bill explicitly retains mandatory detention of unauthorised boat arrivals and  unlawful non-citizens who pose a risk to the community or repeatedly breach the  conditions of their visa. 

 'The Rudd Government announced these policies in July 2008 to address serious  deficiencies in Australia's immigration detention system,' Senator Evans said. 

 'Under the previous government, detention was the default position. Children were  locked behind barbed wire and many desperate and vulnerable people who had fled  war and persecution were left to languish in detention centres with no resolution in  sight. 

 'The Rudd Labor Government was elected on a platform that included a commitment  to implementing more humane detention policies while maintaining strong border  protection. 

 'The Government has maintained extensive air and sea patrols, a system of excision,  and the mandatory detention and offshore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals. 

 'The Migration Amendment (Immigration Detention Reform) Bill 2009 will  complement Australia's strong border security measures and ensure Australia's  immigration detention system treats people humanely while continuing to protect the  Australian community.' 

 The Rudd Government's new detention policies were unanimously endorsed by the  Joint Standing Committee on Migration, which included Liberal MPs Dana Vale,  Petro Georgiou, Senator Alan Eggleston, and Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Sharman Stone.  

 Recommendation 12 of the committee's December report stated: 

 The committee recommends that, as a priority, the Australian Government introduce  amendments to the Migration Act 1958 to enshrine in legislation the reforms to  immigration detention policy announced by the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship. 

 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has been implementing the reforms  announced in July through policy and guideline changes. The Government now  wants to embed those policies in law. 

 'The Rudd Government's approach to managing immigration detainees is one based  on a risk management matrix,' Senator Evans said. 

 'The level of restriction on a person's liberty and the degree of monitoring relates  directly to the assessed risk to the Australian community, including any risk of non-compliance with Australia's immigration laws.  

 'The Government urges the Liberal Party to support the Bill so that children are never  again locked up in a detention centre and detainees are treated humanely with the  dignity they deserve.' 

 The detention policies announced in July 2008 that provide the framework for the Bill  are: 

 1.  Mandatory  detention  is  an essential component  of strong border control.   2. To support the integrity of Australia's  immigration program, three groups will be 

 subject to mandatory detention:      a.         all unauthorised arrivals, for  management of health, identity and security  risks to the community  b.         unlawful non-citizens who present  unacceptable risks to the community, and  c.         unlawful non-citizens who have  repeatedly refused to comply with their visa  conditions.   3. Children, including juvenile foreign fishers and, 

 where possible, their families, will not be  detained in an immigration detention centre  (IDC).   4. Detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary  is not acceptable and the length and conditions  of detention, including the appropriateness of  both the accommodation and the services  provided, would be subject to regular review.   5. Detention in immigration detention centres is  only to be used as a last resort and for the  shortest practicable time.  

 6. People in detention will be treated fairly and  reasonably within the law.   7.  Conditions  of  detention will ensure the inherent  dignity of the human person.
