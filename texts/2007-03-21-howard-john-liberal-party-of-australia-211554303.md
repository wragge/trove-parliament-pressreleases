 Speech Transcript 

 21 March 2007 

 Address to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute  Theatrette, Parliament House 

 E&OE... 

 I appreciate Peter Abigail and ASPI giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished group on the situation today in  Iraq and the broader security implications. 

 In one sense, this quiet corner of Parliament House is a long way from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In another sense,  it helps bring into focus much of what is at stake.  

 A hallmark of our free society is the ability to debate issues forcefully and to resolve inevitable differences peacefully. Our  enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan see this as a sign of weakness. We know it is our greatest strength. 

 This place is where political differences are aired and resolved in policy. I am well aware of the sharp political differences  that  exist  in  Australia  today  over  Iraq,  differences  that  have  existed  since  the  Government's  initial  decision to  commit   forces four years ago. 

 I  am  not  asking  Australians  to  discount  the  enormous  difficulties  in  Iraq  or to  change  their  views  about  the  original   decision. I am asking them to consider the situation we now face and the stakes involved. 

 What Iraq and her people now need is time, not a timetable. They seek our patience, not political positioning. They require  our resolve, not our retreat. 

 This  place  also  reminds  us  that  our  democratic  processes,  liberty  and prosperity  rest  on  a  foundation  of  order  and   security. Without security, democratic politics and economic development are impossible. 

 That's why the first duty of government is to protect and defend the nation's security, its people, its borders, its interests  and its values. 

 Sometimes that involves tough decisions which place Australian men and women in danger - no less today than in earlier  times of war. 

 And notwithstanding our strong economy, a near record stockmarket and low unemployment, this is a time of war.  

 The long war against violent Islamic extremism goes on. It is a very different kind of war - a war without borders and with  no clear frontlines; a war fought as much by our ideas and values as by our armies. 

 Terrorist cells are active today in between 30 and 40 countries plotting action based on a warped interpretation of Islam.  Attacks have been planned in Australia. 

 Nor  should  we  forget  the  essential  lessons  of  11  September  2001  -  that  failed states  can  quickly  become  havens  and   projecting grounds for global terror; and that terrorists can turn our openness and technological achievements against us to devastating strategic effect. 

 Globalisation is far from a universal solvent for ideologies of hate or old wounds - real and perceived.  

 The West faces a major disjunction today between political fragmentation and economic globalisation; between abundant  opportunities created by liberal, democratic societies and reactionary forces bent on crippling them; between the relative  comfort and normalcy of so many Western lives in 2007 and the risks and sacrifices of those striving to bring peace and  stability to troubled lands. 

 There are about 3,300 Australian Defence Force personnel on operations overseas  or undertaking security tasks in our  maritime protection zone. They advance our nation's interests and ideals with great courage.  

 I regard them as our finest patriots and our finest internationalists.  

 Roughly 2000 Australians are part of operations today in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

 In Afghanistan, our largest contingent - the Reconstruction Task Force in Oruzgan Province which I visited last week - is  working  in  partnership  with  the  Dutch  on  the  reconstruction  and  improvement  of  infrastructure.  It  has  made excellent   progress  rebuilding  schools,  roads  and  bridges  and  training  the  local population  to  ensure  the  benefits  remain  into  the   future. 

 Afghanistan is a highly dangerous theatre of war with 2006 the most violent year since the country was liberated. We can  expect a revived Taliban to launch further waves of attack this year.  

 As winter in Afghanistan gives way to spring, coalition forces are again on the offensive to ensure that Afghanistan will  never  again  be  a  safe-haven  for  terrorism  -  and  to  help  the  Afghan  people  surmount  the  many  problems  they  face in   building a secure, stable and democratic future. 

 This will take time and effort. I assured President Karzai when I met him that Australia remains committed to this task. 

 Last week, I also visited Australian troops in Iraq. I spoke with their commanding officers and men and women of all ranks;  I spoke with Prime Minister Maliki; and I spoke with General Petraeus, the new US commander of the Multinational Force  in Iraq. 

 It's just over four years since I announced the commitment of Australian forces to the US-led military operation in Iraq.  This was one of the most difficult and contentious decisions this government has taken. 

 I share the concern and distress of all Australians about the continued violence and suffering in Iraq - and their frustration  that it is sometimes hard to see progress. 

 Clearly there have been setbacks and mistakes on the way to Iraq taking full charge of its own affairs. The loss of life and  injuries sustained by both Iraqis and coalition forces is tragic. 

 But I would hope even critics of our involvement in the original action recognise the need to honour our obligations to the  Iraqis and to help them towards a more stable future. 

 Every  time  ordinary  Iraqis  are  given  the  chance  they  say  the  same  thing  in overwhelming  numbers:  We  want  peace,   stability and democracy. 

 I did come  away  from  my  visit  to  Iraq with  a  sense  of  cautious  hope  -  about the  new  security  plan  and  about  the  Iraqi   government's willingness to face the big challenges ahead.  

 Above all, I came away convinced that the Iraqi people want the same things we look for in our own lives - safety for their  families, a chance to earn a living and a say in how they are governed.  

 In  March  2003  I  was  very  clear  about  the  reasons  for  taking  decisive  action against  Saddam  Hussein.  I  simply  remind   people of the strategic realities we faced. 

 That Saddam's regime was a real and growing threat to the stability of the Middle East. Containment was breaking down. 

 That Saddam had form, both as an aggressor against his neighbours and as a tyrannic ruler of his own people. And that  his non-compliance with 17 UN Security Council resolutions over a period of 12 years was weakening the credibility of the  United Nations. 

 That virtually all governments (including opponents of the war such as France and Germany) as well as the now Leader of  the  Opposition  agreed  that  Saddam  had  chemical  and  biological  weapons  and  had  designs  on  developing  nuclear weapons. Mr Rudd said that Saddam's possession of weapons of mass destruction was “a matter of empirical fact”. 

 That the Middle East has always been very important to Australia's security and broader national interests. 

 And that the strength of our alliance with the United States is based ultimately on the preparedness of each party to share  risk and the overall security burden on behalf of the other. 

 Our alliance has never been stronger and has never brought greater benefits for Australia, including in our engagement  with Asian countries. Our practical contribution and preparedness to stand with America in Iraq is of first order importance  to its current strength and vitality. 

 Australia's  role  in  Iraq  has  evolved  consistent  with  Coalition  strategy  and conditions  on  the  ground.  Our  current   contribution  is  heavily  focused  on  helping  to  build  the  capability  of  the  Iraqi  Security  Forces  so  that  in  time  Iraq,  as  a sovereign independent state, can look after its own security.  

 This is central to the reordered security strategy in Iraq and to the prospects for political reconciliation.  

 Training and mentoring Iraqi forces has been a key element of Australian support for Iraq ever since 2003. The Australian  Army has been involved in the basic training of more than 12,500 Iraqi soldiers. The Navy has helped train the Iraqi Navy  and Marines as part of the Iraqi Coastal Defence Force Training Team. 

 Australia's  Overwatch  Battle  Group  (West)  is  helping  provide  security  to  the Al  Muthanna  and  Dhi  Qar  provinces  by   engaging the provincial leadership, mentoring the Iraqi Security Forces and standing ready to intervene if required. 

 These  are  the  first  two  Iraqi  provinces  where  local  forces  have  primacy  for security.  There  have  been  attempts  to   destabilise  the  legitimate  authorities,  particularly  in  Al  Muthanna  where  a  government  building  was  attacked  in  recent months. The Iraqi military and police were able to quash the violence with the assistance of tribal leaders and the local  government. 

 Despite the dangers, this points to the progress that has been made in southern Iraq. The fact that the local authorities  dealt  with  the  violence  themselves  without  requesting  Battle  Group  support  shows  they  are  strengthening  their  grip  on   security. 

 At the same time, the Australian Army Training Team is working hard together with Iraqi Army Instructors to ensure Iraqi  forces have the capacity to assume greater security responsibilities. I recently announced a strengthening of this training  effort comprising a dedicated logistics team of roughly 50 personnel, together with about 20 extra Army training instructors  to work with the Iraqi Army.  

 In  addition,  the  Battle  Group  will  be  merged  with  the  Australian  Army Training  Team  to  increase  flexibility  and  improve   training capability. 

 Along with our other commitments - including air reconnaissance, maritime security, and in the capital Baghdad - these  Australians  are  helping  the  Iraqis  build  their  security  capacity  against  difficult  odds.  As  I  saw  last  week,  they are   performing their task with the skill, commitment and good humour that has always been the ADF trademark.  

 They have won the trust, confidence and respect of the Iraqis.  

 The fact that the training is occurring in Iraq itself is significant, both practically and symbolically. It ensures our trainers  have greater credibility and develop stronger bonds of trust with Iraqi recruits.  

 Our  commitment  continues  to  adapt  to  prevailing  demands  on  the  ground.  The  ADF  is  training  Iraqi  officers  and  non-commissioned  officers  with  programmes  that  emphasise  professionalism,  teamwork  and  leadership  in  a  non-sectarian environment.  Some  of  these  units  are  now  deploying  to  Baghdad  to  put  these skills  into  effect  as  part  of  the  Baghdad   Security Plan. 

 Such training is absolutely vital to the Iraqi Army developing as a non-sectarian national institution capable of attracting  the support of the Iraqi people.  

 It's important not to see this noble work in narrow  military terms. Despite  the neat academic distinction,  so-called ‘hard   power' security tasks are deeply intertwined with the efficacy of ‘soft power' instruments like diplomacy, political dialogue,  economic development and humanitarian aid. 

 Security is the precondition for political and economic progress. 

 That's why the international community must stay engaged at the hard end of the struggle in Iraq.  

 What  the  Iraqi  people  need  most  at  this  pivotal  moment  is  not  only  our  soft power,  but  also  our  sticking  power  on  the   ground. 

 To state the obvious, I do not want our forces to be in Iraq one day longer than necessary. But I believe strongly that to  signal our departure now would be against Australia's national interest.  

 The stakes are extraordinarily high - for Iraq, for the wider Middle East, for American power and prestige and, ultimately,  for our region and our own national security.  

 The  presence  of  Australian  forces  in  southern  Iraq  is  helping  build  the  Iraqi people's  confidence  in  legitimate  authority.   These are people for whom a short time ago the word authority meant one thing: brutal dictatorship. 

 Ironically,  last  year  the  Government  was  being  castigated  by  the  Opposition for  placing  our  troops  in  a  dangerous  and   worsening security environment in southern Iraq. Then, the critique shifted. Our troops were themselves exacerbating the  situation. Now it seems we are being told by the Opposition that the southern provinces of Iraq are not dangerous enough to justify Australia's presence.  

 If it's bad our troops shouldn't be there. If it's good our troops shouldn't be there. When has a political party made so many  worthless speeches about internationalism and ‘good international citizenship' and done so little to support it? 

 The  view  that  the  job  Australia  is  doing  in  southern  Iraq  is  of  little consequence  is  both  wrong  and  insulting  to  those   serving with great courage. Nor is it a view shared by those on the ground whose perspective is personal and practical  rather than political.  

 Let me quote the commanding officer of Overwatch Battle Group West based in Dhi Qar from a recent Bulletin article: 

 “The  strategy  should  be  to  reinforce  success  down  in  the  south,  rather  than saying  the  job  is  done,  because  what  that   does is to serve as a model. Almost like a test case that the rest of the country can look at and say, ‘I want what they have  down in the south'. You start from a secure base and then you have to expand out from there.” 

 One Australian reservist explains his motivation simply: “I've seen how people live here and I've seen how people live in  Australia and I see the potential for them in the future. I'm happy to help.” 

 When I say they are our finest internationalists, you see what I mean.  

 On  the  contribution  to  the  broader  coalition  commitment,  let  me  quote  the  head  of  national  co-ordination  for  Provincial   Reconstruction Teams, the retired US General Eric Olson: 

 “The US has decided that they (sic) won't operate in Dhi Qar anymore because it's gone under provincial Iraqi control. If it  weren't for the Australian Army, I couldn't have a provincial reconstruction team and we'd lose all influence and virtually all  presence here.” A withdrawal, he says, would be “devastating for a province like Dhi Qar”. 

 At  our  joint  press  conference  in  Baghdad,  Prime  Minister  Maliki  welcomed Australia's  continuing  commitment  to   supporting Iraq, including by providing training and overwatch. In his words: “The mission is still ongoing and we still have  a  desire  for  Australia  to  remain  and  to  continue  its  support  until  we  are completely  confident  that  the  operation,  the   planning, all the terrorist activities cease to exist.”  

 Rejecting artificial timelines, he went on to praise Australia's troops for their behaviour, not only on the military front, but  “on the way they deal with ordinary Iraqis”. That statement should be not only a source of great pride in this country but  also provide reassurance that our strategy for building Iraq's security capability is the right one. 

 Clearly  the  larger  fate  of  Iraq  hinges  on  Baghdad  where  violence  has escalated,  especially  since  the  bombing  of  the   Samarra Shrine in February last year.  

 As the battle for Baghdad has intensified and changed, new thinking has been called for.  

 The plan announced by President Bush in January has a stronger emphasis on securing areas cleared of terrorists and  sectarian militias, on political reconciliation and on challenging states such as Syria and Iran to become part of a solution  in Iraq rather than be part of a bloody, chaotic problem. 

 American  and  Iraqi  forces  are  in  the  early  stages  of  what  will  be  a  tough assignment.  There  have  been  some  positive   signs so far, but success is by no means assured. 

 The five additional US combat brigades for deployment to Baghdad will be in place by June. Importantly, Iraqi command of  the Baghdad Security Plan puts an Iraqi face to security operations.  

 Iraq's Government must live up to key security, political and economic responsibilities under the plan. 

 Prime Minister Maliki has shown his preparedness to take difficult steps, like  authorising arrests of Shia supporters and  Coalition  operations  against  Shia  militias.  Moves  to  allow  some  former  army  personnel  to  return  to  the  army are  also   welcome.  The  approval  of  a  draft  oil  law  which  fairly  distributes  oil  revenues  -  a  key  Sunni  demand  -  is  another  step  

 forward. 

 Robust diplomatic activity is supporting the Baghdad Security Plan. 

 The Iraqi Government's initiative in hosting a conference earlier this month where the US and other permanent members  of the Security Council sat down with Iraq's neighbours - including Iran and Syria - was a positive development. It will be  followed by a further meeting of foreign ministers.  

 Iraq's  neighbours  must recognise  that greater  stability  in Iraq  is fundamental  to  their  national  security.  Iran  in  particular  must end the transfer of arms to radical Shiite groups attacking coalition forces and Iraqi Sunni civilians. 

 In parallel, there must also be a more concerted attempt to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict.  

 For the record, let me state clearly why I believe a timetable for premature withdrawal of coalition forces from Iraq would  invite disastrous strategic and humanitarian consequences. 

 First, it would undercut the forces of moderation in Iraq at the precise moment when they have a chance - perhaps the last  chance - to stabilise their country. Sectarian violence would escalate, with the Sunnis abandoning the unity government  and parliament. 

 Second, it would lead to more widespread and extreme human rights abuses, more internally displaced Iraqi civilians and  further outflow of refugees to neighbouring states. 

 Third, a precipitate withdrawal would give a green light to those looking to make Iraq a platform for global terror. With Al  Qaeda  and  other  extremists  claiming  withdrawal  as  a  victory,  this  would  likely  inspire  more  terrorism  outside  Iraq,   including in South East Asia.  

 Iraq is undeniably a frontline in the fight against international terrorism. The terrorists view it as such. 

 Fourth, it would further destabilise what is already the world's most unstable region, perhaps igniting a wider war in the  Middle East. Any prospect of resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict would lie in tatters. 

 And fifth, it would be a crushing blow to America's global leadership, emboldening those who, like Osama Bin Laden, have  argued all along that America is a “weak horse” on which no one should depend. 

 The consequences for our own region should not be underestimated. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emphasised to  me last week the negative strategic implications for East Asia of a US defeat in Iraq. 

 As such, it may be clever politics to portray Afghanistan as the ‘good war' and Iraq as the ‘bad war', but it is a position  cloaked in folly. 

 Why is it right that Australia and its allies prevail in Afghanistan but fail in Iraq? Why is it okay for Iraq to become a safe  haven for global terror but not Afghanistan?  

 Why is building Afghanistan's security capability more compelling than building Iraq's? And why is a massive setback to  American global leadership fine in one place but not in another? 

 I am prepared to accept constructive criticism of the Government's position on Iraq. But our opponents also have to take  responsibility for their position. 

 In Mr Rudd's case, it's been unclear at times whether he is auditioning for the editorial board of the Weekly Standard or to  be Australia's answer to Michael Moore. 

 The Opposition's current position on Iraq is that the conflict is a civil war, requiring solely a political solution. Labor argues  that the key to that political solution is a ‘staged' withdrawal of Australian and US military forces to create pressure for the  Sunni and the Shia to reach a political accommodation. 

 In my view, both the analysis and the policy prescription are fundamentally flawed. Success in Iraq requires both a military  and a political strategy, each reinforcing the other. 

 Sectarian  violence  in  Iraq  is  clearly  a  major  problem.  But  despite  being  put under  enormous  pressure  neither  the  Iraqi   Army nor the national government have split along sectarian lines. 

 That really would be a disaster, and it is this disaster that our strategy seeks to avert. 

 We recognise that in Iraq as well as in Afghanistan political progress and security are inextricably linked.  

 Labor seems to believe  that  Iraq  can  achieve reconciliation without security  - essentially, that if the coalition leaves the  Iraqis will sort out their differences. 

 Let's be  clear. Labor supports setting a timetable  for withdrawal from Iraq irrespective  of the  situation on the ground. It  would pull out Australia's combat forces as soon as it can. And it opposes stepping up our effort to train the Iraqi Army -even though the Iraqi government, the US government, Tony Blair and the Baker-Hamilton report all agree that training is  a critical priority. 

 Our position could not be more sharply different. 

 We  believe  that  restoring  security  in  Iraq  is  critical  to  creating  the  space and  time  Iraqis  need  to  find  a  lasting  political   solution. This means that we are opposed to a precipitate withdrawal. It means we are opposed to setting timetables for  withdrawal. 

 And it means we strongly support training - which is why the government has decided to step up our training effort. 

 We will be able to leave Iraq. But we cannot do so responsibly until we have some confidence that the Iraqi security forces  are  in  a  position  to  defend  Iraq's  democratically-elected  government  and  the  Iraqi  people,  whether  from terrorists,   insurgents or sectarian strife. 

 I  found  Mr  Rudd's  comments  about  Labor's  policy  instructive  when  he  said  he would  not  leave  the  Iraqis  and  the   Americans  “immediately  in  the  lurch”.  The  pirouetting  around  lurch  and  immediate  lurch  strikes  a  pose  I  hadn't encountered before.  

 For mine, a lurch delayed is still a lurch. 

 There might be few good alternatives in Iraq. But that does not absolve those of us in positions of political responsibility  from facing up to the alternatives that exist.  

 The question to be confronted now is this: what do we do to maximise the chances of future stability in Iraq? 

 That means supporting the Iraqis and our coalition partners in their security operations and continuing to strengthen the  capacity of Iraq's security forces. Then, as Iraq moves forward, we can draw back. 

 I believe this course is in Australia's long-term national interest. And it happens to be the right thing to do.
