 Australian Immigration: Grasping the New Reality

 Speech to Nation Skilling: Migration Labour and the Law Symposium Sydney, 23 November, 2000

 Ladies and gentlemen:

 It gives me great pleasure to address you today on Australia's migration program.

 This is particularly so because today represents a striking opportunity for those of us with an enduring interest in this area of public policy - those of us that will contribute to and shape this debate in the years to come.

 The opportunity that we should today grasp, while largely attitudinal, is enormously significant.

 It is to shift our mindset from that shaped by the debate of years past to one relevant to migration's contemporary international reality.

 It is time we move forward from arguments that may have served us well in the past but are now anachronistic and outmoded.

 Today I will outline why the way in which Australia selects its migrants is so much more important than the sheer numerical size of our programs.

 I will detail the reforms the government has implemented in order to construct a migration program which is able to meet enormous international challenges and deliver significant benefit to the nation.

 This has principally been achieved through initiatives in the area of skilled

 migration.

 I will also examine our options for ensuring that we continue to stay ahead of the game in adjusting to the ongoing challenges in order to continue migration's proud nation building legacy.

 For this objective is the cornerstone of the government's vision for Australia's immigration program.

 Importance of Skills in Migration Selection

 The principal aim of Australia's immigration system is to maximise as far as possible its contribution to Australia's well being.

 To achieve this, Australia's immigration policy has four key goals: to contribute to Australia's economic, social, environmental and humanitarian interests.

 To ensure, as far as possible, that Australia's future is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable within Australia's demographic context, the Australian government uses a number of immigration-related tools.

 These include the annual migration and humanitarian programs, temporary entry programs, settlement services, and the right to apply for citizenship after a period of time in Australia.

 These immigration processes have been, and are continuing to be, streamlined to fACILitate more rapid entry for those who meet criteria established to achieve Australia's national interest objectives.

 The primary way these objectives can be met is through the judicious application of carefully tailored skilled entry programs.

 To realise our potential economic and social benefits, Australia needs a high proportion of skilled, entrepreneurial and youthful immigrants.

 Australia needs to attract people with the skills and qualities that will ultimately benefit the country.

 In order to successfully do this, the government has instituted widespread reform of the program, and I will detail shortly the direction and thrust of this reform.

 But let me begin by discussing their results - results that are overwhelmingly clear and overwhelmingly positive.

 Economic modelling I commissioned in 1998, performed by Chris Murphy's Econtech, demonstrates that by 2007-2008, all Australians will be some $134 per person per year better off as a result of this government's increased focus on skilled migration.

 The government's approach is further vindicated in an ACIL consulting report which shows the strengthening impact on the nation's budget of the reformed migration program.

 Further research conducted by access economics into the performance of business migrants compared their businesses with other Australian businesses of comparable age, size and industry sector. It shows that the migrants' enterprises were found to be generally more productive in terms of net worth, turnover and export levels.

 Allow me to quantify this. Since the introduction of the business skills category in 1992, statistics show that within three years of arrival:

 86 per cent of business migrants are engaged in business - of which 77 per cent are new businesses; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Each new business employed an average of five people; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» 64 per cent of businesses are involved in exports; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The average money invested in the business was $600,000. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 My department also invests considerable effort into tracking the performance of different cohorts of arrivals through the longitudinal survey of immigrants to Australia.

 Key indicators such as income, labour force experiences, health status and housing show those entering through the skilled stream have considerably more success than other migrants.

 Preliminary data from the second longitudinal survey which tracked a more recent cohort of arrivals suggests that the performance of this group far exceeds the first.

 As many migrants in this group were selected with the assistance of the government's enhanced skilled selection mechanisms, this lends further evidence to the success of our approach.

 These results underscore the importance of skilled migration selection mechanisms, and why we can't risk compromising them.

 Competition for Skilled Migrants

 The success that this data demonstrates we have achieved with our more focused approach has precipitated strident argument from many that we should institute a phenomenal increase in our skilled migrant intake.

 The unfortunate reality is, however, that an endless queue of skilled migrants is not eagerly awaiting the opportunity to reside permanently in Australia.

 There is increasing global competition for skilled migrants and migrants who create positive social and economic benefits for their country of residence.

 Countries not traditionally viewed as migration nations are now joining the race to lure them to their shores.

 Allow me to give you some examples of the lengths to which some countries are now going to attract such migrants, beginning with established migration nations.

 Canada has proposed a new points test with greater emphasis on university education.

 New Zealand has lowered their pass mark. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The United States recently passed legislation to double the quota of skilled temporary entry workers under their H-1B visa class, particularly because of the pressure for many more IT workers.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The United Kingdom has also introduced new measures to make them more attractive. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Other countries not viewed as traditional or core migration countries are also stepping up their efforts, with just some examples being Singapore, Iceland, Italy, Finland, Germany and Ireland.

 Government Reform Initiatives

 As high calibre individuals comprise a limited international pool, and are quite obviously in far greater demand than ever before, Australia has to be much cleverer in our approach to attracting them.

 In 1996 the Coalition Government inherited a migration program out of touch with contemporary Australia's needs.

 Under the previous administration, our migration program had become little more than a family reunion program.

 Extensive reforms were implemented that not only restored the program's integrity, transparency and relevance, but also firmly anchored it in the national interest.

 Allow me to outline these reforms.

 The most significant results have been achieved by our work in rebalancing the migration program between the family and skill streams, and more effectively targeting skilled migrants.

 In 1995-96 the family stream comprised around 70 per cent of the migration program, with skilled migration barely an afterthought.

 This imbalance has been addressed, with skill stream visas increasing from 29 per cent in 1995-96 to over 50 per cent now.

 As a result Australia is now attracting better-educated, younger, more job-ready migrants with the language skills to operate successfully in the Australian workplace.

 In July of last year, following a comprehensive review, the government introduced a new points test to select the majority of skilled migrants.

 This has further enhanced Australia's ability to select migrants who better meet the needs of the Australian labour market.

 Examination of the applications received under the new arrangements confirms

 this. For example, of applications received for the period 1 July, 1999 to 30 June, 2000:

 60.5% are aged between 18 and 29 and 81% are aged between 18 and 34. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» 50% of all skilled applicants have Australian qualifications. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Around 25% hold qualifications in information technology. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» 87.7% of all skilled applicants scored the maximum 20 points available

 for English. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Furthermore, 64.5% of sponsored applicants and 93.5% of independent applicants have to date scored the maximum of 60 points for skills. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Since 1 July 1999 new measures have been introduced to streamline the employer nomination provisions to enable employers to meet critical skill needs.

 The Government has been able to conclude a number of regional headquarter agreements and labour agreements that provide for 4,121 temporary and permanent entrants.

 The Government has also effected a critical shift in the way in which greater numbers of successful overseas students are able to migrate to Australia after completing their studies.

 This gives Australia a significant advantage over competing countries in terms of our ability to attract more overseas students and more skilled migrants.

 The 5,000 place contingency reserve I established last year offers another example of the government's preparedness to increase the skilled intake without diluting selection criteria.

 This mechanism creates the scope to increase the size of the migration program as long as business, industry and state/territory governments target additional migrants where a demonstrable shortage exists in a specific skill.

 One of the most exciting avenues the government has been expanding in order to enhance our ability to attract skilled migrants is through long-term temporary entry provisions.

 Increasing numbers of young, highly skilled people are now moving temporarily around the world in pursuit of opportunities presented by increased international trade and investment.

 Not wanting their opportunities or abilities to be confined, more and more people are seeking long-term entry to countries such as Australia.

 Around 33,000 long-term temporary resident business visas were granted in Australia in 1998-99 - almost the same amount as the total number of skilled permanent migration visas issued for the same period.

 The number of these skilled temporary entrants has been rising steadily over recent years, and long-term temporary movements now make-up around 50% of net overseas migration.

 These individuals bring with them new ideas, skills, technology, understanding and contacts, and make a major contribution to Australia's international competitiveness.

 The long-term temporary entry arrangements developed by this government are rated amongst the most effective arrangements in the world for attracting what is a highly mobile and lucrative workforce.

 Long-term temporary migration will become the touchstone for migration's international future, and without the numeric controls some other countries impose on these temporary entry categories, their volume is likely to continue to rise.

 Despite everything we have done, the Government is not resting on its laurels.

 I am currently considering recommendations from the business advisory panel report I commissioned last year to review all of Australia's business entry programs.

 It has suggested ways to fine-tune the regulations for the business skills visa in order to attract quality applicants and help businesses fill skilled positions.

 I am considering the recommendations with a view to implementing further appropriate reform.

 In response to the panel's work I have already been able to adjust the visa criteria for business owners within the business skills category.

 International Comparisons

 Allow me to also undertake a performance assessment of Australia's migration program by comparing it to that operated by the United States.

 The US is regarded by many as the world's greatest immigrant nation and by virtue of this reputation offers us an excellent point of reference. But consider the following:

 The percentage of overseas born in Australia's population is more than double that of the US and this will remain the case for the foreseeable future.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Australia's official permanent migration intake is, in per capita terms, close to double that of the United States. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Our per-capita offshore refugee program is larger than that offered by the us. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The US immigration program is heavily skewed to family migration, and this is a problem that continues to plague the US administration. The need to redress this imbalance is a major consideration of the immigration debate currently underway in the US, and was a key recommendation of the Jordan commission established by President Clinton.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 As family reunion dominates the US program, it follows that their skilled âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 migration intake is small. In per capita terms their skilled intake is minuscule compared to Australia's.

 In Australia we recognise and encourage the economic benefits of skilled temporary entry by allowing size to be demand driven. The US skilled temporary entry intake is capped at a relatively low level compared to Australia's.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 We also have an overseas student intake that in per capita terms is much larger than the US, is more varied and is highlighted by more opportunities for successful students to migrate here permanently.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Need to Maintain Selection Standards

 While the Government is endeavouring to continually expand the benefits skilled migration brings to Australia, any attempt to achieve a sudden or significant increase in the numbers of skilled migrants would unquestionably require a significant dilution of selection standards.

 Additional migrants would be older, less skilled or less fluent in English - and less employable. In fact the ACIL report I mentioned earlier shows that unskilled migrants are generally a major cost to the Commonwealth budget.

 Put bluntly, significantly increasing our intake in an untargeted manner would signal a return to policy which brought in large numbers of poorly qualified migrants merely to swell the ranks of the unemployed.

 Any attempt to further increase the skilled intake must proceed in a targeted and carefully considered manner that does not require a major dilution in selection standards.

 The New Zealand Experience

 The short sightedness of a drive to increase the gross permanent migration intake without considering other implications is highlighted by New Zealand's experiences.

 New Zealand has the largest per capita permanent migration program in the world and has had for many years.

 But it has failed to deliver a net increase in population from migration. The relatively poor performance of the New Zealand economy has resulted in their rate of net overseas migration falling to negative 10,000.

 So despite their large per capita gross intake, far more people are leaving New Zealand than arriving.

 A large permanent intake obviously does not guarantee an improvement in the economy, a high rate of population growth, or even positive levels of net overseas migration.

 Future Directions

 The need for us to be competitive in attracting young skilled migrants will become greater as we move into the future.

 ABS projections indicate that, because our population is ageing, annual labour force growth will decline from 1.6 per cent in 1998-99 to 0.4 per cent in 2015-16.

 By 2016 the growth rate is expected to be very low by historical standards, and still falling.

 The labour force itself will be ageing:

 In 1998, 10 per cent of the labour force were aged 55 years or over. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» By 2016, this is projected to be 15 per cent. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The number of people retiring each year will, therefore, increase considerably.

 These changes in the labour force are part of a larger and inevitable demographic shift in Australia, principally because our fertility rate is below replacement level and still falling.

 However, this is not a cause for alarm. All populations must eventually seek to stabilise.

 Australia can reach stabilisation during the 21st century as long as we continue to:

 Promote family friendly policies that help to minimise falls in fertility; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Encourage high levels of workforce participation particularly by older workers; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Attract young skilled migrants with good english language skills. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Conclusion

 In summary, we need to maintain and indeed enhance our comparative advantages in immigration management and in particular our ability to attract young, skilled migrants.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 As the economic cycle turns and we engage in increasing competition for these migrants with the countries of Europe in particular, we will need well-established mechanisms in place to reinforce our advantages in this important area.

 I am determined to ensure that our immigration mechanisms continue to deliver for Australia.
