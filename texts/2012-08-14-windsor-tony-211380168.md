 TONY WINDSOR B.Ec MP  INDEPENDENT   FEDERAL MEMBER FOR NEW ENGLAND   

 PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES   

 Media Release     14th August 2012   Asylum seeker “Package” a way forward  The asylum seeker package developed by the Angus Houston Expert Panel and accepted by the Government has been welcomed by the Independent Member for New England Tony Windsor.  Mr Windsor is pleased that there now appears to be a way forward on the issue that has been causing much angst in the community.  “The issue of asylum seekers arriving by boat has long been a bone of contention with no silver bullet to fix it.  “The Angus Houston Expert Panel has delivered their report and provided the Australian Parliament with a way forward.  “From my point of view, I am supportive of the ‘Package’ of measures recommended by the Expert Panel and I trust that it will get the support of the Parliament so that no more lives will be lost at sea by people fleeing situations that make the risk of the sea journey to Australia more attractive than going through the asylum seeker process.  “The issue of asylum seeker processing is very complex and no doubt will require further work but as a way forward to stopping people putting their lives at risk in the first instance, I believe the adoption of the recommendations will help,” Mr Windsor said.
