 Harradine to boycott address by President Hu Jintao   

 Senator Brian Harradine will not attend tomorrow’s joint sitting of Parliament to hear  Chinese President Hu Jintao.   

 “I will not attend the address by Chinese President Hu Jintao in protest against the  continuing and appalling breaches of human rights committed by the Chinese  Government”, Senator Harradine said today.   

 “The parliamentary address sets a precedent by honouring the head of a totalitarian regime  in the elected chamber.”   

 Human rights abuses in China include:   

 â¢ executing more people than all other countries combined;  â¢ the continued oppression of Christians who refuse to be part of official Chinese  Government churches;  â¢ the jailing of Chinese labour leaders for organising thousands of sacked workers in a 

 peaceful protest against the loss of their jobs;  â¢ the continued oppression of members of Falun Gong;  â¢ the one-child policy which uses forced abortion, sterilisation, fines, imprisonment  and other punishments to force compliance; 

 â¢ the arrest and forced repatriation of North Korean asylum-seekers; and,  â¢ continued restriction on freedom of expression, religion and association in Tibet.   

 “I call on the Australian Government to publicly raise its concerns about China’s human  rights record with President Hu.  Avoiding discussion of these abuses is not helpful to  developing a relationship with the Chinese people based on openness and friendship.   

 “We have to show solidarity with the Chinese people”.
