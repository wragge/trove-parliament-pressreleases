 OLYMPIC AID

 I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will make a donation of $1.5 million to Olympic Aid in support of its programmes.

 In providing this donation, the Government recognises the importance of the work of Olympic Aid in raising funds to assist people, especially children, in need. Since it was established, the organisation has demonstrated a strong commitment to international humanitarian assistance.

 The Government supports the initiatives to which Olympic Aid will be directing much of the funding it has raised during the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, including;

 · Indigenous sports programmes in Australia;

 · the distribution of funds to or through organisations in Australia, such as the Patrick Rafter Cherish the Children Foundation, the Goolagong Sports Libraries, the Leukaemia Foundation and the Children’s Cancer Institute; and

 · the 2000 Appeal for Sport Relief which aims to introduce and/or develop sport in refugee camps in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 The commitment to charitable organisations and to cancer treatment and research in Australia is welcomed. At the same time, the sport related initiatives will be valuable in providing young people with an opportunity they might not otherwise be given to learn to play and to participate in sport, and to derive the associated benefits this brings.

 I congratulate everyone involved with Olympic Aid for giving of their time and resources while the Olympic Games are in Australia to contribute in a meaningful and significant way to helping disadvantaged young people.
