 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania   Ministerial rights remain supreme over human  rights 

 17th Jun 2005 

 Greens will amend bill in Senate to insert Petro Georgio terms  The rights of the Minister for Immigration to deny children and families  release from detention centres remains under tonight’s compromise  deal by the Howard Government, Greens Senator Bob Brown said.  "And the right to hold asylum seekers for years also remains, despite a  2 year review by the Ombudsman," Senator Brown said.  "Despite the 3 month timeline for the department and then the Refuge 

 Tribunal there is no right of release once that timeline is passed -  simply a report to parliament but with parliament not empowered to  act on it.  "The Greens will move to amend the Government’s legislation so that  it matches the original Petro Georgio terms.  "While the Liberal moderates have forced some minor changes the  structure of the Howard Government’s inhumane system stands,"  Senator Brown said.    

 Senator Brown is speaking at a legal forum in Sydney this  evening.  6pm-8pm, level 2, 170 Phillip St (law society building), Sydney.
