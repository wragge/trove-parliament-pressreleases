 MEDIA RELEASE

 Greens welcome court challenge   

 The Australian Greens have welcomed the court challenge launched by Melbourne lawyers  today on behalf of an asylum seeker who lost his eye in the deadly attacks on Manus Island.    

 “This is an important case that will force the government to be held accountable for the violent  attacks. The Abbott government failed to ensure the safety of those on Manus Island and they  must now face the music,” said the Greens spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Hanson-Young.    

 “The Government has a duty of care to asylum seekers detained at the Manus Island camp. They  have clearly failed this man and all those who were brutally attacked during the violence.    

 “No amount of compensation will ever make up for the harm this man has suffered.    

 “The courts will ultimately decide on the outcome of this case, but I hope that justice prevails.   

 “The Minister for Immigration must rule out returning this man to the horrors of Manus Island  and instead release him into the community.    

 “I have written to the Minister urging him to act upon medical advice that this man should be  placed in community detention immediately so that he can receive the appropriate care he  requires.”    

 “The Senate inquiry into the attacks on Manus Island has revealed that the detention camp is  not safe and never will be.    

 “We cannot ensure the safety of asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru; these centres need  to be shut down immediately.”
