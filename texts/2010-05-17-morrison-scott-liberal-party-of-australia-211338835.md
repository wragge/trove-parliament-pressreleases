 RUDD OUTPERFORMS 2009 ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS IN LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS   

 More people have arrived illegally by boat so far in 2010 than in the entire 12  months of 2009, due to Kevin Rudd's failed immigration and border protection  policies, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said  today.   

 "The arrival of the latest illegal boat over the weekend means that barely four  and a half months into the year, 2,873 people have arrived illegally by boat, 81  more than the 2,792 who arrived during the whole of 2009," Mr Morrison said.  "This is a shameful indictment of our immigration and border protection chaos  under Kevin Rudd and his failure to take direct action to fix a problem of his  own making," he said.   

 "This comes after Kevin Rudd notched up a gold medal for 100 illegal boat  arrivals earlier this year and just days after Kevin Rudd broke another record  for the 100   

 "Kevin Rudd’s ongoing failure to acknowledge his immigration and border  protection failures means more records are on the way   

 "People smugglers are undeterred by Kevin Rudd’s election fix, 20 boats with  899 people on board have arrived since it was announced five weeks ago.  "There are now more than 3,500 people in some form of immigration detention  around Australia, including Christmas Island, 1,500 more than were being held  in January, including those whose claims have been rejected yet are still here,  going through their appeals.   

 "Kevin Rudd’s failure has also seen a billion dollar budget blow out for costs  on Christmas Island and to increase the capacity of on shore detention  facilities, including the reopening of the Curtin Detention Centre.  "More boat records and more budget blow outs are a certainty under Kevin  Rudd’s failed policies and failure of leadership on immigration and border  protection," Mr Morrison said.
