  DEMOCRATS  M ED1 A : : ; : A y  28 JUNE 2004  SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS & SPOKESPERSON ON DEFENCE 

  The Australian Democrats have launched a new internet mini-movie "Truth about War" to highlight  the lies around the decision to go to war against Iraq. 

  The one minute mini-movie is part of the Democrat's campaign to remove the Prime Minister's power  to take Australia to war without Parliament consent:  http://www.Iiedetectors.net.au/truth about wadmovie/ 

  "The 'Truth about War' was launched in Parliament House today, but most people will see it on  computer, having received it from colleagues and friends," said Democratls Leader Senator Andrew  Bartlett. 

  Around fifteen thousand people have already seen 'Truth Overboard' a short clip exposing the truth  a bout asylum seekers: http://www. liedetectors.net .au/free the refugees/movie/ 

  "The Democrats are hoping 50,000 people will see 'Truth about War'," said Senator Bartlett. 

  "The Democrats strongly opposed this war and believe we now have an obligation to assist in the  restoration of security. 

  "The Democrats don't want any Prime Minister to have the opportunity to go to war without the  consent of the Parliament or the people and against the wishes of the United Nations. They did it this  time and they will do it again, unless we change the law." 

  The text of the "Truth about War" : 

  The invasion of Iraq was illegal, immoral and unwise. The war cries were lies.. . 

  LIES: that it would be a quick, easy war. .. that the war would decrease terrorism.. . that weapons of  mass destruction would be found.. . that the war would make Australia safer. 

  Iraqis died because of lies. Our troops shouldn't have to risk their lives for lies. 

  Australians didn't vote for war. And neither did the Senate. 

  Democrats demand Parliament consent before going to war. Don't let any Prime Minister do it again. 

  The soundtrack is an original song, "Angels of Death", by former Brisbane band, The Cutters.
