 GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DELIVER ON DEFENCE BUDGET

 Despite all the Government’s rhetoric, the Budget delivers only $69 million in net additional funding to Defence for the war on terror, boat arrivals and domestic security.

 Defence has been required to trade off future capability to fund the Howard Government’s current commitments.

 These are short-sighted and tricky measures that come at the cost of Australia’s long-term defence.

 The Government has forced Defence to make $268m in savings to cover the cost of the current operations and increased security measures.

 The Government has paid just $69m of a $337m bill for the current Defence operations and enhanced domestic security.  Leaving Defence to pick up the $268m shortfall.

 This is in a year when the Government expects to collect $660m from Defence asset sales.

 The Howard Government is funding current operations at the expense of the future capability of the Defence Forces.

 The Budget includes $150m in savings by delaying capital projects under the White Paper. These are in addition to the $60m in delayed projects in 2001-02.  This brings a total of $210m in necessary capital spending that has been pushed back.

 While recognising there is a critical shortage of ammunition, with an additional $21m for extra stocks to cover a $80m shortfall annual shortfall.  This will be at the expense of cutting $21m from necessary equipment purchases.  The Army will now have bullets but no guns.

 There is $97m in savings on administration, which means the halt on essential repairs, maintenance, training will continue into 2002-03.

 The Government’s claim of a net additional $107m for Defence (page 14 of the Defence Portfolio Statement) includes $38m to replace Defence revenue lost because of delays to asset sales.  Which leaves a net additional to $69m for the war on terrorism, patrols for asylum seekers and domestic security.
