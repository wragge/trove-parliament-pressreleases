that the RRT's management team returned to its full complement to ensure 
productivity levels were maintained," Mr Ruddock said. 

  

 "The new Acting 
Principal Member, Mr Nygh, is highly experienced and respected in his 
field. The Tribunal will benefit from his legal expertise and effective 
administrative management." 

  

 Mr Nygh has had extensive 
experience as a Family Court Judge and a Professor of Law and is currently 
Adjunct Professor at the University of New South Wales and a practising 
barrister.

Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, Mr Nygh has responsibility for 
the Tribunal's overall operations and administration.
