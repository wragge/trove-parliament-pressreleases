 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER

 FA24 22 February 2002

 TRILATERAL MEETING IN BALI

 I look forward to attending the inaugural Trilateral Meeting in Nusa Dua, Bali on 26 February involving Australia, Indonesia and East Timor.

 Indonesian Foreign Minister Dr Hassan Wirajuda, East Timor’s Chief Minister, Dr Mari Alkatiri, East Timor’s Senior Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Dr Jose Ramos-Horta, and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in East Timor/UNTAET Transitional Administrator, Dr Sergio Vieira de Mello, will also attend the meeting.

 The meeting will be a significant opportunity to strengthen relations between our three countries.  The key to East Timor’s future development and security will be its relationship with its regional partners, including Australia and Indonesia.  I welcome Indonesia’s development of the trilateral concept and its commitment to cementing good relations with its newest neighbour.  Australia is keen to support these positive developments.

 The meeting’s themes will cover issues of common interest.  These include economic and development cooperation, East Timor’s transition to independence, East Timor’s future participation in regional institutions, refugee issues, the South West Pacific Dialogue and regional security issues.

 The Trilateral Meeting will be held the day before the Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Transnational Crime in Bali.
