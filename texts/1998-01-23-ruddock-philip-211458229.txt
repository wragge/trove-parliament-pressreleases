The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock has
described the Young Australian of the Year, Tan Le as a wonderful role model
for other young immigrants and refugees.

 Tan Le, from the
Melbourne suburb of Footscray arrived from Vietnam with her family 16 years
ago and has been very active in the community.

 "It is great
achievements like this that demonstrate the underlying commitment that
migrants tend to have for Australia," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I was
particularly impressed by Ms Le's comments on immigrants arriving in
Australia with hopes and aspirations, not just a physical presence."

 "Her reference to an immigration of dedication and hard work and an
immigration of the heart, I think particularly typifies the commitment many
migrants have for Australia."

 "Ms Le is to be commended for her
outstanding community work in assisting migrants to settle successfully. It
is this selfless activity that will help ensure that Australia continues to
be recognised as one of the most cohesive nations."

 The
Minister said Ms Le represents the human face of our refugee and migration
programs and demonstrates that we are talking about more than just numbers
and statistics.
