 Senator the Hon David Johnston  Shadow Minister for Defence   I   Senator for Western Australia  Media Release    REMEMBER OUR NAVY PERSONNEL IN THIS MESS  In the Senate today Shadow Defence Minister David Johnston paid tribute to navy personnel on the Armidale class patrol boats who have been at the frontline of Labor’s failed border protection policies in recent years.  “They have been needlessly exposed to extreme danger and risk by this massive policy failure, probably the greatest policy failure in the history of our country,” Senator Johnston said.  “Many of them undertaking a nine day turnaround from home base Darwin, out to Christmas Island, then a number of days patrolling picking up these boats….several members of the Armidale Class force element group regularly work through their eight week on, four week off cycle, many of them work 12 weeks straight on the high seas doing nothing more or less than operating a taxi service.”  Senator Johnston also reminded the Senate about the ADF personnel who were involved in the SIEV 36 explosion in April 2009 when asylum seekers deliberately sabotaged their boat then blew it up, with nine navy personnel onboard, killing five Afghan men.  “It’s not enough to come here on one of these boats having paid for the privilege but when they get here they want to blow the boat up, with Australian people onboard,” Senator Johnston said.  “There were many heroic acts that morning in the process of saving the passengers and crew of SIEV 36 and also in their treatment thereafter.”   “Australian navy lives were put at risk wilfully by this negligent and derelict government, that is what has happened here, and I for one will not allow it to go without saying - but for the fact of the professionalism and the dedication of these 

 navy people who have had to endure this policy fiasco, there would have been many,  many more deaths.”   

 “Four years later here we are, the Government dragged kicking and screaming by  Angus Houston to this solution, that’s what this mess has come to - the events of  2009 should have woken them up…that the removal of the Pacific solution was going  to lead to disaster, to death and end in tears, and it has.”   

 “I want to say to the navy men and women of the patrol boats out of Darwin, a huge  thank you for their loyal professionalism that they have continued to display, for year  after year, dealing with this classic massive fiasco of policy - their dedication to duty  has been an example to all of us….they’re the people whose rights we’ve should have  been thinking about.”
