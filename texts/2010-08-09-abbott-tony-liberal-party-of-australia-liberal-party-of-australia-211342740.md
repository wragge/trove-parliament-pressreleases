 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 9 August 2010   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   BRISBANE 

 

 Subjects: The Rudd-Gillard Government’s home insulation debacle; the Coalition’s real action plan;  economic management; infrastructure.  

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m pleased to be here at the home of Ms Collins. Liz Collins is one of the hundreds of thousands of  Australians who has been dudded by the Rudd-Gillard Government’s home insulation programme. This has  been an absolutely monumental example of incompetence and on its own, quite apart from the dysfunction  at the heart of this Government, quite apart from the other monumentally botched programmes such as the  education revolution programme, on its own this programme would be grounds for removing the  Government. This is not just a waste of money, although it’s been that in spades, this is a programme which  has actually put Australians in danger. This is a programme from a government that has actually put  Australians in danger. We’ve had, as you know, almost 200 house fires and four deaths linked to this  programme. It is typical of the extraordinary incompetence of this Government that we should have  programmes like this from it.    

 So, as you know, from Day One the Coalition will move to rectify problems like this. From Day One the  Coalition will address the economic predicament that this Government has put Australia in. From Day One,  there will be no mining tax. From Day One, there will be no carbon tax or no electricity tax. From Week  One, we will have a debt and deficit taskforce. From Month One, we will have the tax debate that Australia  needs. So, this is a Coalition which is ready to govern.    

 Finally, I just want to point out that my shadow ministerial colleague Scott Morrison has been in Nauru. I  understand that its pretty clear, not only that the Nauruan Government would welcome the re-establishment  of an asylum seeker processing centre in Nauru, it’s also pretty clear that the centre which was built by  Australia, with Australian money, can be made operational quite quickly and again I say to the Prime  Minister, if she’s fair dinkum about stopping the boats, pick up the phone to the President of Nauru, he  wants to help.    

 So, are there any questions?   

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, you said you’d have a surplus, bigger than Labor’s in 2012/13. Is that is gospel truth? And  exactly how would you do that, given you’ve made more than $20 billion worth of uncosted promises?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the interesting thing about our spending commitments is that they are more than matched by our  expenditure reductions. This is a government which is pork-barrelling right around Australia right now,  there’s not a marginal seat that isn’t being showered with cash by the Government, but there have been no  serious expenditure reductions that the Government has announced. Basically, these, this pork barrelling is  coming from specially set up hollow logs that the Government put in place by…   

 QUESTION:    

 Why don’t you put in your costings for independent scrutiny?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We’ve already put several billions of our policies into the Treasury, we set up the Charter of Budget  Honesty, naturally we will abide by it.   

 QUESTION:    

 Peter Costello has put out today upset at Labor’s campaign ads that use some of his voice in them. Now,  Julia Gillard’s come out reading a statement that, full statement that quote was from. Why should Labor  have to remove these ads? Why should they?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I just make two points. The first point I make is that this Government is so bad that it is absolutely  nothing positive to say about its record. This Government’s campaign for re-election is totally based on fear  and smear and I think the Australian public can see through a Government which has been so bad it has  absolutely nothing to say about its own record and look, I certainly welcome Peter’s intervention in the  campaign today, because he knows what it’s like to inherit massive Labor debt and have to repay it.    

 QUESTION:    

 On the insulation scheme and the stimulus, economists generally agree the stimulus did help Australia go  through the GFC. Do you deny the stimulus had any positive impact on growth during that period?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, look, let’s just refer to some of these economists. You’ve got Warrick McKibbon, the Reserve Bank  board member, who said that the stimulus package was panicky. You’ve got Sinclair Davidson, another  distinguished economist who said that the whole package was shambolic. You’ve got Professor Tony  Makin, a third distinguished economist who said that really what got Australia through the GFC was a  combination of the monetary policy and the reduction in the value of the Australian dollar. So that’s the fist  point I make, the second point I make is that if this Government had any serious economic credentials at all  it would drop the mining tax and it would stop the electricity tax. People need to understand that as sure as  night follows day, if this Government is re-elected there will be a mining tax that will do very serious  damage to Australia’s most successful industry and there will be a carbon tax or an electricity tax and that  will drive massively up, the cost of living pressures faced by ordinary Australians. This is a very serious  situation. If the Government is re-elected, your power bills are going up and up and up.   

 QUESTION:   

  3 

 Can I ask you about your debt reduction taskforce? It creates a sense of crisis when Australia’s debt is 6 per  cent of GDP which is hardly high compared to other nations. But if your taskforce were to have some  prosecution powers, would the first person to be arrested by this taskforce be Warren Truss? Let me take  you through what he announced yesterday. He announced…   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I this a question or is this commentary?   

 QUESTION:   

 …just some of the details that might have passed you by. Sale to Colac four lane highway, Sydney to  Brisbane, [inaudible] to Gympie, Launceston to Hobart, all four lane highways. Some of these things have  been estimated to cost $40 billion. Would you arrest him?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I guess the point to make about the infrastructure projects that were announced by Warren Truss yesterday is  that these are all projects that are going to be funded under AusLink Three. And AusLink Three is an  infrastructure programme which is budgeted for and there is money in AusLink Three to cover the costs of  these projects.   

 QUESTION:   

 Can I ask some clarifications, please, on the issue of abortions. Would an Abbott government make  terminations a separate Medicare item number? Would an Abbott government ban Medicare funding of  terminations and would an Abbott government ban RU487?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The answer is no. We’re not going to do any of those things that you suggest and we have no plans  whatsoever for any change in that area.   

 QUESTION:   

 What’s your response to the Government’s claims that you’re rolling yourself into a small ball, hoping that  that you’ll get over the line on the back of their mistakes rather than anything you’re offering. What is your  response to that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 As I said, I think it was pretty clear yesterday in our campaign launch that we have a plan to make Australia  different and better, should we be elected. As I said, on day one, no mining tax, no carbon tax. In week one,  a debt and deficit taskforce. In month one, the tax debate that we need. As well, what was there yesterday is  a serious attempt to make the Australian economy a participation economy. At the moment there aren’t  enough older people in our workforce. There aren’t enough women with the opportunities that they need and  I want to see young people who at the moment are trapped in welfare, I want to see more of them in the  workforce.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, just on insulation. You’ve said that you’ll inspect 1.1 million homes. Labor’s said that they will  inspect 200,000 homes and they’ve set aside $430 million to do so. How do you propose to inspect 1.1  million homes within the $800 million that’s left in the budget. Secondly, what are you actually going to do 

  4 

 to help people, like Elizabeth Collins who you’ve just visited today, when all you’re proposing to do is  inspect her home and that has already been done. Are you going to pay her back the money that taxpayers  have already spent so she can get new insulation?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The issue is how do we rectify the damage that this Government has done? About a million homes have  been insulated and it’s been estimated by the Government itself that a quarter of a million of those  insulations are either dodgy or dangerous, so every one of these insulations needs to be inspected and almost  certainly, of the quarter of a million that have been dodgy or dangerous, some will need to be rectified, some  will need to be removed. In this home, we know, because it has actually been inspected, that first of all, a  dangerous job was done. The original installer has alleviated the danger but in alleviating the danger, has  destroyed the insulation so now there are just a whole lot of useless batts sitting around in the roof here.  They’re interfering with the electrics, they’re not providing any useful purpose whatsoever. Now, plainly,  what should happen in this situation is that the batts should be removed and what I’m saying is that if people  organise for this to be done by professionals reasonably, they will reimbursed and within a month of an  incoming government, of an incoming Coalition government coming into office, that will start to happen.   

 QUESTION:   

 What is the status then of projects like the duplication of the [inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 All commitments that have been entered into will be kept.   

 QUESTION:   

 In this term? In this coming term?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 They will be kept in the timeframe in which the commitment was made. Now, if you take…   

 QUESTION:   

 Why didn’t you announce them yourself though?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 If you take, for arguments sake, the duplication of the Midlands Highway between Hobart and Launceston  that will happen starting from 2014. It will be paid for out of AusLink 3 and the point I make is that all of  the commitments will be implemented in the timeframe indicated.   

 QUESTION:   

 Labor is attacking you on the economy. [inaudible] I heard a number of people yesterday defend you and  your economic understanding but I never heard you say it. Why are you qualified to be in charge of the  economy?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m not into blowing my own trumpet. I try not to be into blowing my own trumpet. But let’s be very clear  about this, I was a Minister for nine years, a Cabinet Minister for seven years, in what was the most 

  5 

 economically successful, the most economically competent government in Australia’s recent history. For  three years I managed an extremely complex portfolio, Employment and Workplace Relations and for four  years I was the Health Minister and as Health Minister I managed an annual budget in the region of $50  billion and I’ve got to say, without blowing my own trumpet I hope, that there were no pink batts disasters  on my watch. There were no Education Revolution rip-offs on my watch. I was a Minister who respected the  taxpayers dollar and that’s the problem with this Government they don’t respect the taxpayers dollar.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, here’s a chance to show us your economic credentials. You’ve told us that the budget, your  surplus will be much bigger than the Government’s. Can you quantify it, tell us exactly how much? And is  your focus group research obviously telling you something about the carbon tax that you’re now referring to  it as an ‘electricity tax’?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The carbon tax which will follow as sure as night follows day if this Government is re-elected is effectively  an electricity tax. It is a tax on your power. Your power bills have gone up by 35 per cent since November  2007. They will go up much further, much faster if this Government is returned because there will be as  Julia Gillard says a price on carbon. There will be as Bob Brown wants a carbon tax. They have done their  deal. There will be a carbon tax or an electricity tax if this Government is returned.   

 QUESTION:   

 Show us your economic credentials. Tell us how big the surplus is going to be.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I will announce well before polling day what we believe the budgetary outcome for 2012-13 will be. What I  say at the moment is that it will be significantly larger than that achieved by the Government because you  just can’t trust this Government not to see blow-out after blow-out.   

 QUESTION:   

 What expenditure have you racked up to this point?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We’ve announced a series of programmes all of which are fully costed and fully funded. The point is we  have announced some $28 billion of cuts to recurrent spending, recurrent spending that will happen under  Labor that won’t happen under us.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you not have a specific figure [inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The point I want to make is that we have a specific figure for each of the spending commitments that we  have made. Every spending commitment that we have made is a commitment which has been costed. Every  single commitment is costed and what we will achieve from our reductions is that we will more than cover  the cost of the total number of commitments that we made.   

 QUESTION: 

  6 

 

 On debt and deficit, Mr Abbott, can you explain the difference between your taskforce and the ERC?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, the ERC is specifically associated with a budget process. This is a taskforce that will be working on  day one to rectify the damage of Labor’s budget. Thank you.   

 

 [ends]
