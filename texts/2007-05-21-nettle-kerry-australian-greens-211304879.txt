 Government has no plan for climate change refugees 

 21st May 07 

 The Immigration Department conceded today that the government has no plans to help our 

 Pacific Island neighbours who will need to migrate because of climate change induced rising sea 

 levels. 

 

 “The Government and Immigration Department are in climate change denial," Australian Greens 

 Immigration spokesperson Senator Nettle said today.  

 

 "The Immigration Department is not working on any plan to deal with the most pressing issue 

 facing the entire planet.  

 

 The Greens are calling on the government to lead an international response to the issue of 

 climate refugees and develop a plan for how we can help our Pacific Island neighbours who are 

 being forced to leave their home because of rising sea levels. 

 

 "Following from the Stern report that predicted 150 to 200 million Climate Change refugees, last 

 week Christian Aid released a report estimating that 250 million people faced permanent 

 displacement as a direct consequence of climate change. The Department Secretary Andrew 

 Metcalfe was unable to comment on whether the assessment was accurate because the 

 government is doing no work on assessing this issue.  

 

 Even the Defence Department report "Joint operations for the 21st century”  has indicated that 

 climate change will see more resource wars occurring but the Department of Immigration has 

 not even started to produce any documents on climate change. 

 

 "Having accepted that the refugee convention does not cover climate refugees, the government 

 is still refusing to work with the international community or our region to come up with a plan 

 about how to deal with the movement of people due the climate change," concluded Senator 

 Nettle.
