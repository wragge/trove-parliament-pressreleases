 New report backs Greens’ proposal to overhaul mandatory detention  

 The Greens have welcomed the latest report from the Australian Human Rights Commission  into appalling conditions at the Villawood detention centre in Sydney. 

 The report joins condemnation into Australia’s mandatory detention centre policy this week  by UN Human Rights Commissioner, Navi Pillay, earlier this week. 

 “We hope this new assessment, which highlights the fact that some children have been  detained for at least 12 months, will provide yet more evidence to the Gillard government that  its policy of mandatory detention, particularly of families and children, is both costly and  ultimately damaging to children,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today. 

 “The Commission has again demonstrated the long-term mental health implications of  detainees, pointing out six deaths in detention centres in the past nine months, and three  apparent suicides in Villawood alone. 

 “Yesterday, ASIO chief, David Irvine, confirmed in Senate estimates that they can perform  initial security checks of asylum seekers in ‘as little as a couple of days’. 

 “After initial health and security checks, asylum seekers should be in community detention  while their claims are assessed. Not only is this cheaper than the $2.5 billion allocated for off-shore processing and border protection over the forward estimates, it’s also less likely to  damage their health and well-being. 

 “The Greens’ policy of ending mandatory detention has been repeatedly endorsed by  Australian and international human rights and health experts. It’s only Labor and the  Coalition which remain wedded to this expensive and cruel practice. 

 “If the major parties are serious about fixing the problems within detention centres, they need  to back the Greens and proceed with community release. 

 “The Greens are also concerned that on Tuesday in Senate estimates we received  confirmation from DIAC that under qualified and untrained Serco staff are working in  detention centres, but there is no scrutiny of how these breaches are managed or responded  to, despite the enormous amounts of public dollars paid to this company.”
