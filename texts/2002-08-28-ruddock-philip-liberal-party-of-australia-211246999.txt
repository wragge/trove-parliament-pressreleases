 Minister Launches Family Visitor Network MPS 080/2002

 A new program allowing Australians to help family members applying to visit them from overseas was launched in Canberra today by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock.

 "The Family Visitor Network is an Australia-wide information network aimed at raising community awareness about the Government's visitor visa policy, procedures and decision-making processes at overseas posts," Mr Ruddock said.

 "It has been established in response to concerns that people in Australia did not understand what their relatives needed to do to obtain a visa and were confused about procedures at overseas posts and how to make enquiries."

 Part of this process will assist the community to appreciate the importance of people abiding by their visa conditions.

 "My department recently released the discussion paper on Future Options for Indicators to Determine the Risk Factor List," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This paper provides the community with information on why such processes are in place and an opportunity to have input into the Government's visitor visa processes."

 The situation on visitor visas for people from higher immigration risk and emerging tourism markets is exceptionally good. Approval rates and visa grant numbers from emerging tourism markets such as China and India continue to grow strongly.

 "Non-return rates have declined significantly and rates and absolute numbers of visitors applying for refugee status are down," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Family Visitor Network provides information and advice via DIMIA's general telephone enquiries line to family members wishing to support the visit of their relatives to Australia.

 This includes information about processing requirements and procedures at the overseas post at which their relative intends to apply. There is also advice on how to apply for visitor visas in emergency circumstances.

 "In an emergency, such as a death in the family or an urgent medical crisis which means a client needs their relative in Australia quickly, they can contact the Family Visitor Network for assistance."

 An information kit to facilitate the visa application is available by ringing DIMIA on 131 881 and following the prompts to speak to a family visitor telephone operator.
