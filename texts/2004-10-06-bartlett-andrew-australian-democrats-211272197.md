 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1021 WEDNESDAY 6 OCTOBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT                LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS                           DEMOCRATS WILL KNOCK OFF THE ROUGH EDGES Australian Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said it would be the Senate that would determine whether Mark Latham's promises were implemented, if he becomes Prime Minister.  "The $13 billion plus spending promises of both Mr Latham and Mr Howard should not be rubber stamped or blocked without responsible consideration," Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said. "Latham promises to be steady and disciplined. Only the Democrats are sufficiently independent of Labor to ensure that will happen. "Voters that like Mr Latham but are nervous about rising interest rates and giving too much power to the unions should be voting Labor in the lower house and Democrats in the Senate.  We'll keep him honest.  "Whatever people's concerns, from industrial relations to economic management they should be assured the Democrats will scrutinise and judge the detail of each piece of legislation and knock off the rough edges. "On health, Democrat Senators will keep Labor to their promises of linking rebates to bulk billing targets, try to ensure no Australians are pushed down the queue by Medicare Gold, and tackle the pressures on public hospitals. We will also push for a realistic look at the schedule for rebates and its indexation. "On education, the Democrats will support Mr Latham's plans for greater investment in education, and reverse the HECS hikes, and we will ensure the money is spent in a way that's smart and fair. This year around 40,000 children missed out on preschool, around 40,000 missed out on place in TAFE and 20,000 missed out on university.  Urgent reinvestment is needed address the shortage of nurses, teachers, scientists and tradesmen.   "We will support helping small business through a simplified BAS system, and the Democrats have already initiated a Senate inquiry to ensure that all other red tape compliance costs are identified and addressed. "Mr Latham's undertaking to deal with anti-competitive behaviour by big companies, could be achieved by implementing all 17 recommendations of the recent Senate Inquiry into misuse of market power, to give the TPA real teeth with enforceable protection for small businesses.   "Latham's portrayal of AWAs as pitting employee against employee ignores the merits and popularity of individual contracts, when there is adequate protection. "The Democrats will continue to push for policies for the many groups and issues who have been forgotten in this campaign including Indigenous Australians, refugees and asylum seekers, people with a disability and their carers, and many others," Senator Bartlett concluded.
