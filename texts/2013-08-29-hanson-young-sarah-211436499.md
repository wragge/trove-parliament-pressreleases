 MEDIA RELASE    

 Thursday 29 August 2013    

 

 Families divided by Labor's cruelty    

 The Labor Party's decision to separate pregnant mothers from their families is yet another sign  of the old parties' race to the bottom on refugee cruelty, the Australian Greens have said.    

 "Labor's obsession with refugee cruelty has divided the electorate and now it's dividing  vulnerable families", the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said  today.    

 "Separating mothers from their families won't save lives at sea. It's time for the Labor Party to  give up the charade and admit to the Australian public that its hard-line refugee policy is actually  about winning votes not stopping boats.    

 "Reports of family separations have come a day after we heard that a child had attempted to  take his own life on Christmas Island.    

 "Pregnant women are being separated from their families and children are being driven to  attempt suicide. This is the harsh reality of what Labor's 'hard-line' asylum policy actually looks  like.    

 "The Greens are standing up for refugees and trying to offer them the fair-go that Australia is  famous for.    

 "A genuine regional solution of assessment and resettlement is the only way that we can save  lives at sea, but the old parties are locked in a race to the bottom that is making that impossible.
