 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING - THE HYATT, COOLUM, MARCH 4TH 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Zimbabwe, the Governor-General and Party Reform. 

 JOURNALIST: Did you pick up any tips on how to be a winning Labor leader?

 CREAN: Yes we had a very good discussion with the Prime Minister. Helpful in terms of the modernisation of the party but also two key areas. One, tax credits, the earned income tax credits that as a policy mechanism, so we’re going to follow up more on that detail because this is an initiative that we developed some years ago, I want to reactivate it, and also the question of investment in the public infrastructure. So I think that from a domestic economy point of view that was very useful. We also touched on international matters - the Zimbabwe issue, asylum seekers and the issue of the Kyoto Protocol.

 JOURNALIST: Well what do you think about Zimbabwe? Does the Commonwealth really have any bite considering the failure to reach any agreement?

 CREAN: Well I think it’s important that the Commonwealth does have some bite. We believe that sanctions should’ve been imposed. I’m not too sure what the final communiquÃ© will be. It’s been further discussed today but if in fact there is an argument that one needs to wait until after the elections next weekend, the least the Commonwealth must do is to impose some trigger such that if it is established that free and fair elections were not conducted, then action can be triggered immediately by the Commonwealth.

 JOURNALIST: What kind of relevance does will the Commonwealth have if it doesn’t take some strong action against Zimbabwe?

 CREAN: Well I believe that the Commonwealth does have to look at this issue terribly seriously in terms of its ongoing relevance. It’s true that

 there’ll be different points of view but they have to be talked through in a consistent way. If the Commonwealth stands for anything it stands for democratic values and the promotion of them. You can’t say you’ve got democratic values if you’re sanctioning elections that are not free and fair. And so I think it is important if the Commonwealth believes in these things then it does have effective sanctions that it’s prepared to move quickly on them. It’s prepared to act. That I think will be the hallmark of its relevance.

 JOURNALIST: Can we ask you about the Governor-General? The Governor-General said that he’s strong in his resolve. That means he is determined to stay doesn’t it? You’ve been asking him to go, what can you do now?

 CREAN: Well he may well be determined to stay. My argument has been that if that’s the case the Prime Minister should step in and ask the Queen to terminate his appointment. You can’t separate the circumstances of the individual from the Office. The Office is being diminished. The Office is being embroiled in controversy and the Office is being affected daily. Daily, we see withdrawals of endorsement for the Governor-General. It’s clearly impacting on the Office. That’s not good for the country and it’s in those circumstances that the Governor-General should go, either by resignation or by decisive action by the Prime Minister.

 JOURNALIST: It sounds like he’s determined to stay though. He says that the Governor-General position stands on it’s own that it hasn’t been tarnished. Its sounds like he’s going to tough it out.

 CREAN: The Office doesn’t stand on its own. The Office has to stand as a symbol of unity and representation for the nation. That’s what the office must stand for and the longer he persists with this approach the more I think the Office will be diminished.

 JOURNALIST: He doesn’t see it as being tarnished though?

 CREAN: Well I think that is a judgment that he’s making and wrongly. But I think more importantly there’s the question here of the Prime Minister’s judgement. He selected the Governor-General. He must now accept the Office is being diminished. His judgment was found wanting in the appointment because he didn’t check the full detail. His judgment continues to be found wanting now in his failure to act to remove the Governor-General.

 JOURNALIST: Can you tell us anything further about types of reform which we might see in the Labor Party, sort of the British style reforms?

 CREAN: Well that’s not British style reform because I mean what we’ve got to do is to modernise in our own direction. I think that the party if it is to represent a modern Australia, has to be modern in its own right. I’ve already set about some important reforms. The modernisation of the front

 bench and the approach to government, but modernising the Party and modernising our policies is the ongoing process that we must embark on.

 JOURNALIST: Can I also ask you about what sort of precedent does this set in the Governor-General insisting on staying in his position even though he doesn’t have bipartisan support?

 CREAN: Well again he doesn’t need bipartisan support to stay he only needs the support of the Prime Minster. This I believe is a flaw in the process by which Governor-Generals are selected and it’s a flaw that there are no criterion by which objectively Governor-Generals can be dismissed and I think that we do need changes in both of those directions and I’ll be having something to say about that in the future. But my advice to the Prime Minister is that the Governor-General’s appointment should be terminated. I believe that the Prime Minister will eventually come to that view. He may want the Governor-General to resign but if in fact the Governor-General shows every intention of remaining, it’s more incumbent on the Prime Minister to exercise his judgment. His judgment has been lacking on the appointment. His judgment continues to be tested in his failure to act on his dismissal.

 JOURNALIST: Is this the first time you’ve met Mr Blair and what sort of things did you find in common with him?

 CREAN: No it’s not the first time, I’ve met him a number of times both when he was Opposition Leader and I was Employment Minister. He was very interested in the Working Nation program, the concept of Mutual Obligation and took a lot of that on board in the development of policies that the British Labour Party adopted in office. I’ve seen him since he’s been Prime Minister over in the UK and it was a good opportunity to catch up today. We have a lot to learn from him but we will adapt it in our own way.
