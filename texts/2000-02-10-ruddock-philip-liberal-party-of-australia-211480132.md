 Minister in Perth for Consultations on Migration Intake MPS 016/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, is in Perth today as part of his annual national consultations on the Government's migration and humanitarian programs.

 Mr Ruddock said the consultations which included a public meeting overnight at Middle Swan would allow people from Western Australia the opportunity to have their say on the migrant intake for the next financial year.

 During 1998-99, 10,672 migrants arrived in Western Australia. Some 51.3 percent of those arrived under the skilled migration program, New Zealanders accounted for 21.7 percent, and the humanitarian intake was 8.5 percent of the total.

 "Public meetings are part of the Government's undertaking to administer Australia's immigration program in an open and accountable manner," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The public meetings and other consultations are also a chance to discuss Australia's population trends and the role immigration has to play.

 "They provide an ideal forum for all Australians to contribute their ideas and comments and gives the Government community views on issues regarding refugee resettlement and other humanitarian and general migration issues.

 "During the consultation process I will be meeting representatives from more than 2,000 groups, including State, Territory and local governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare organisations, church groups and representatives of Australia's migrant communities."

 Mr Ruddock said the consultations were also an opportunity for people to discuss the potential impact that the recent influx of illegal immigrants would have on Australia's refugee and humanitarian resettlement program.

 In addition to 10,000 offshore places, the program for 1999-2000 allocates 2,000 places for people making protection claims from within Australia.

 However, if that number is exceeded because recent illegal arrivals and other onshore applicants are able to sustain refugee claims, it will reduce the number of places available to people identified by Australia and the UNHCR, as being in urgent need of resettlement from other countries.

 The consultations started in Melbourne late last year, and include face-to-face and public meetings in capital cities and major regional centres in all states and territories.
