 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 03 023 13 May 2003 

 Australia's Aid Budget: Promoting Regional  Stability, Security and Economic Growth

 I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide $1.894 billion as Official Development  Assistance (ODA) in 2003-04, an increase of $79 million over the 2002-03 budget figure  ($1.815 billion) and a real increase of over 2 per cent. This results in an ODA/GNI ratio of  0.25 per cent, again placing Australia above the donor average which, in the latest year  available (2002), is 0.23 per cent.

 Conflict and instability, including the threat of terrorism, impact directly on the development  prospects of countries in our region, and therefore Australia's national interest. The aid  program, through support for conflict resolution and peace building, helps lay the foundations  for sustainable development and poverty reduction.

 The Australian Government's aid program will continue to place a high priority on promoting  development in the Asia Pacific region, with a focus on good governance and enhancing the  capacity of partner governments to promote peace and manage non-military threats to security  such as people trafficking and trade in illegal drugs.

 AID BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS

 A continuing commitment to supporting good governance, peace building and delivery of  basic services to communities in the nations of the Pacific is demonstrated by an increase in  total aid flows to $176 million - a real increase of over 4 per cent on the 2002-03 budget.

 A $7.5 million Peace and Security Fund will be established to provide flexible and targeted  assistance to directly address needs in post-conflict societies such as the Solomon Islands. The  Fund will also address the threat of terrorism and other aspects of trans-national crime that are  of concern in the Pacific.

 Total funding to Indonesia will increase by $30 million to $152 million to support improved  governance, counter-terrorism and more effective delivery of basic services. Australia will  assist Indonesia to improve the quality and accessibility of its mainstream education services,  and improve health services as a practical memorial to the victims of the Bali bombing.  Australia will also provide substantial support for Indonesia's elections in April 2004.

 Regional counter-terrorism measures in East Asia will receive additional funding from  Australia. This includes activities in support of an APEC Leaders' initiative to halt terrorist  financing, promote cyber security, and protect cargo, ships, aviation and people through 

 

 improved border and customs controls.

 Continuing substantial support will be provided to Papua New Guinea to improve economic  and public sector management and maintain government services.

 Funding of $132 million will be provided for international humanitarian, emergency and  refugee programs, a significant increase on the 2002-03 aid budget figure of $116 million. This  will further enhance the aid program's ability to respond quickly, flexibly and effectively to a  range of humanitarian needs, within our region and around the world, especially those  resulting from disasters and conflict.

 With $100 million already committed, Australia will continue to play a significant role in  humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Iraq, particularly in the area of agriculture.

 Australia will also continue to respond to food needs in Africa during the current severe  famine.

 OTHER FEATURES

 As part of its commitment to supporting developing countries take advantage of the  opportunities offered by the Doha round of trade negotiations, Australia will increase trade-related assistance to developing countries by approximately 10 per cent.

 Recognising that some 800 million people in the developing world are undernourished,  Australia will pledge $1 billion over five years to programs and initiatives that enhance food  security.

 As part of this, in 2003-04 Australia will join with other key bilateral donors in making a multi-year commitment of $16.5 million to theGlobal Conservation Trust, to provide secure funding  for flora gene banks to support food security and agricultural resources in developing  countries.

 To coincide with the International Year of Freshwater, an estimated $94 million will be  provided in 2003-04 towards programs that enhance the sustainable management of water  resources and services, with a focus on strengthening water planning and policy reform and  improving access to water and sanitation services for the poor.
