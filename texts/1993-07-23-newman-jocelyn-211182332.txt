 Jobs for the Girls as Jennifer Rowe Bails Out from International Year of the Family Council

 "The Government has engaged in a tawdry jobs for the girls exercise in appointments to its National Council on the International Year of the Family", Senator Jocelyn Newman, the Shadow Minister for the Family and Health, said today.

 "The Government has loaded the deck of the Council's Executive with blatantly political appointments.

 "Kay Setches is a refugee from the discredited Cain/Kirner Government in Victoria, while Jennie George was the Federal Government's defacto Womens' Affairs Minister during the election.

 "Neither brings any real specialist knowledge or experience across the whole range of family issues. Kay Setches has been out of a job since the Victorian election, while Jennie George is being rewarded for her attacks on the Coalition's Industrial Relations and Women's policies during the election.

 "Rosemary Crowley has been dithering on the appointment of the Council since the election.

 "As a consequence, the Government's program for the International Year of the Family has been utterly directionless, falling way behind schedule.

 "Paul Keating announced Jennifer Rowe as the Chair of the Council back in November last year. The fact that she has now decided to step down for 'work and family' reasons seems ironic.

 "It may well be a reflection on the Government's demonstrated incompetence and lack of commitment in all matters associated with the International Year of the Family.

 "With less than six months to go before the launch of the Year, and nothing of any consequence achieved so far, the newly appointed Council (headed by Professor Bettina Cass) faces an enortnous challenge in preparing the ground for January 1994", concluded Senator Newman.
