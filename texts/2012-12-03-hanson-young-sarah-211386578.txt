 Christmas cards to Christmas Island; supporting  refugees in detention   

 The Greens are calling on Australians to help in sending messages of hope to refugees who are  locked up in our nation’s detention centres this Christmas.   

 “It’s important for us to let refugees know that there are many Australians who genuinely care about  them,” the Greens’ human rights spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “I am asking Australians to write a message of hope to refugees, send it to my office and I will then  send them to Nauru, Manus Island, Christmas Island and our other detention centres.   

 “While many of us will be spending Christmas Day with friends and relatives, we need to take a  moment to think about the people who aren’t as lucky.   

 “There are unaccompanied children and entire families who will spend this holiday season locked up  in island prisons despite having committed no crime.   

 “Christmas is a time for friendship, compassion and understanding.   

 “It’s a time when we can forget about our differences and come together to celebrate the kindness  we naturally feel towards other people.   

 “The recent political storm has consumed these vulnerable refugees, but we must always remember  that these are people just like us.   

 “Perhaps then we will be able to end the terrible race to the bottom that the old parties are engaged  in.”   

 

 Please send your messages of hope to;   

 ‘A message of hope’ c/o Sarah Hanson-Young,  7/147 Pirie St,  Adelaide,  SA 5000
