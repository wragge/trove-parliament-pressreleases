 180 Asylum Seekers Transferred to Manus and Nauru

 DPS 6/2002

 A group of one hundred and eighty asylum seekers has been transferred from Christmas Island to 

 Manus Island and Nauru over the past week.

 Their departure follows the Nauru and PNG Government's agreement to accept more asylum 

 seekers.

 One hundred and forty asylum seekers were transferred to the processing centre on Manus Island 

 aboard three chartered flights between 27-29 January 2002.

 In addition, forty asylum seekers were transferred to the processing centre on Nauru aboard a 

 chartered flight on 31 January 2002.

 The group included people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.

 The asylum seekers will be processed by Australian immigration officials and will receive the 

 assistance of the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) while their claims are assessed.

 The departure of the group means there are 34 detainees remaining on Christmas Island. 

 Arrangements regarding their processing are yet to be made.
