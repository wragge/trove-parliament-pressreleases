 University of Newcastle  Human Rights / Social Justice lecture.   Walking an ethical fault line: Where is Australia headed?  September 4th 2003  Professor Lowitja O’Donoghue   

 Thank you. It is a great privilege to have been invited to give the third Human Rights /Social  Justice lecture.  I am delighted to be here.   

 I am also delighted that this university is demonstrating the importance of human rights and  social justice issues in this public way.   

 Universities, like all large organisations, are under great pressure to perform these days.  And it is of course, reasonable for the community to expect excellence, high quality  outcomes and accountability.   

 However, problems arise when performance is measured almost entirely within a framework  of economic rationalism.   

 And this is especially true when we examine areas that are fundamentally about people and  the quality of their lives.   

 We know, for example, in the area of health, that doctors and nurses feel that they do not  have time to talk to patients - even though this could well be the most helpful aspect of their  treatment.   

 We know that in education, teachers feel overwhelmed with the many demands on them.   

 Despite all the ideals of achieving each child’s maximum potential (intellectually, creatively,  socially and morally) - teachers often feel that in reality, they will be judged on the exam  results they can achieve.   

 In universities, we have seen the decline of subjects that explore questions of social justice  and human rights - subjects such as philosophy, politics and sociology.   

 And we have seen university students under enormous pressure - to find the money to  attend university, to work and study at the same time, to pass exams and to compete for  scarce jobs.   

 Their lecturers too are under pressure - to obtain research funds, tap into potential overseas  opportunities and to graduate as many students as possible.   

 It is perhaps not surprising in this climate that issues of social justice and human rights take  a back seat.    

 In fact, I am sure that it is ‘core business’ of a highly conservative government - to ensure  that these issues do take a back seat.   

 Think of Margaret Thatcher for instance, with her statement “there is no such thing as  society”.    

 I always had the feeling that she might as well have added: “There is only the stock  exchange”!  

  2

 And look at our own political situation at the moment.   

 We have a Government which won office on the basis of a scare campaign.   

 A campaign that was made up of lies and half-truths.    

 The ‘children overboard’ lie was a scandalous affront to the people of Australia.   

 And perhaps even more scandalous is the fact that there has been no censure or  consequence for the Government as a result.   

 In fact, a senior politician was rewarded with an executive overseas position for his part in  the story.   

 And, the Government has been widely represented and accepted as ‘being strong’ in the  general community.    

 The slogan “We will decide who comes into this country” was a carefully crafted and cynical  attempt to suggest that we were in danger of being taken over - or losing control.   

 It was - and is, nonsense. The Government has always decided who comes into the country  - and nobody has ever suggested that it should be otherwise.   

 Rather, what was called for was a fair and humane process - consistent with ethical, human  rights obligations.   

 There are people who have been locked behind razor wire in the middle of the Australian  desert for over 5 years - their only crime being a desperate fear for their lives.   

 People who speak up about these sorts of issues are often dismissed as being “bleeding  hearts”, “losers”, “dinosaurs” or the “Chardonnay set” - labels that are designed to render  them irrelevant.   

 What is regarded as important (in fact the main game) is winning.   

 Winning is a value that is reflected everywhere.    

 It is so culturally entrenched that it is almost regarded as a given. Being successful in  contemporary western culture is an end in itself.    

 It is often more important to have the symbols of success than it is to be doing something  socially useful.   

 And we see people everywhere driven by this hope of being a winner.   

 Part of this syndrome can be seen in the attempt to form identity and values through  consumerism.   

 Anything, from what is fashionable to eat, to where to go on holiday, becomes a marker of  who you are - and perhaps just as relevant, who you are seen to be.   

 It is interesting to observe how universal these consumer symbols are in first world nations.   

  3

 If we visit the fashionable shopping strips in any modern city, for example, we find the same  brand names being offered in the same designer shops.   

 A smart shopping strip in the north shore of Sydney is likely to be more similar to a smart  shopping strip in Rome, than it will be to a local shopping area in Newcastle or Wollongong.   

 Ideas about identity have become confused in these ways as a result of global economics.    

 And one aspect of the confusion is that we lose touch with what it means to be human in  relation to other human beings.   

 It is incredible for example, that privileged Westerners are encouraged to fret about which  brand of running shoe is currently in vogue - rather than the fact that it is slave labour off-shore that is producing it.   

 Now I am not attempting to make you feel guilty about your shopping habits.   

 I have to confess that I am often very uplifted myself by a good bit of retail therapy!   

 But what I am deeply concerned about is that we are being encouraged to dissociate from  our common humanity.   

 We are taught to think that we are not implicated and that indifference is acceptable -  perhaps even normal.   

 There is a fixation in first world countries on the idea of “the individual”. It is represented in  the newspapers everyday with stories of individual achievement or failure, or stories about  celebrities.    

 There is a popular social belief that whether people are doing well or not is dependent on  their individual efforts and virtues.   

 And what follows is also the belief that individuals therefore deserve their own  circumstances.   

 It is a very dangerous myth that denies social, political and historical realities.    

 And it supports the idea that people who are struggling must have asked for it in some way.   

 And of course, that people who are privileged are virtuous and deserving.   

 This is reflected, for example, in the language used about anyone who is seen as different.   

 Asylum seekers are often described as being in some way criminal - or at the very least  undeserving opportunists.   

 Aboriginal people are often characterised as either hopeless, or scheming in their land  claims.   

 People in many Middle Eastern countries are viewed with suspicion as potential terrorists.   

 The list could go on, but my general point is that there is a climate (encouraged by  conservative governments) that promotes: 

  4

 

 â¢ An inward (rather than a social) perspective  â¢ A suspicion of people who are viewed as different  â¢ A lack of trust  â¢ And, a general anxiety about security, safety and the future.   

 What I will put to you this afternoon, is that the climate I have described makes it more  important than ever to take up a social justice agenda.   

 And further, that given the lack of political leadership in this arena, it becomes an urgent  ethical issue for each individual to make a decision about - to take a stand on.    

 I have called this lecture “Walking an ethical fault line” because it evokes for me this sense  that we are all treading a fragile, unstable and dangerous pathway.   

 And it is vital that we think about where it is taking us.    

 One recent direction has been right behind the world’s super power. As I said earlier - being  on the winning side is everything!   

 But it is not the ethical - or even the most practical pathway for us.   

 President Bush, Prime Minister Blair and Prime Minister Howard have adopted a stand that  claims the moral high ground for the world.   

 They have hijacked the idea of human rights to suggest that they have a moral duty to  civilise the less civilised.   

 It is, apart from anything else, breathtaking in its arrogance!    

 And it reminds me of the colonial mentality of over two hundred years ago in Australia,  where there was an assumption that civilising original inhabitants was a moral duty as well a  divine right.   

 This assumption, of course, needs to be challenged. But even if we were to accept the idea  of certain world leaders taking a moral position against tyranny, surely we would want some  evidence of their own human rights track record?   

 I am afraid the track record of our own leaders is not encouraging.   

 In fact, if we were thinking in terms of literal track records and horse racing, I think we have  some very questionable long-shots in the frame!   

 The issue of Reconciliation in our own nation is a case in point. One that is, of course, very  dear to my heart.   

 I would like to offer you some sense of its personal importance to me by making just a few  brief comments about my own story, and the ways in which my life has been affected by  discriminatory policies of the past.    

 As some of you would know, my brother, three of my sisters and I were removed from our  mother and our homelands and taken to a United Aborigines’ Mission, Colebrook Home. 

  5

 Initially I was at Quorn and then I was taken to the Colebrook Home at Eden Hills, near  Adelaide.   

 I was only two at the time and was not reunited with my mother until I was in my mid 30s.   

 And then, tragically, language differences made it virtually impossible for us to communicate.    

 About two years ago there was some very hurtful, sensationalist and inaccurate reporting in  The Adelaide Advertiser and in a Melbourne tabloid paper, about my personal family  circumstances, and whether or not I saw myself as stolen or removed.   

 I now know that this reporting was part of a larger concerted campaign to discredit Aboriginal  people and the Bringing Them Home Report - the report about the Stolen Generations of  Aboriginal people.   

 I decided at that time to make a journey back to my homelands to try to piece together some  of the missing pieces of the jigsaw of my early life.    

 I was accompanied on this journey by another journalist - this time a responsible one, Stuart  Rintoul - who documented my story in the Weekend Australian Magazine.   

 This journey back to my homelands - the Yankunytjatjara land of Central Australia - was the  most difficult and most confronting experience of my life.    

 There were moments when I was not sure that I was up to it. It is still very difficult to talk  about.   

 I didn’t succeed in piecing together all the missing bits of the jigsaw.    

 I didn’t get answers to all those questions asked in a childhood spent in an institution.    

 Questions like:  Who am I? Who’s my mother?  Who’s my father? Where do I come from?      

 But I did stand for the first time on the land where I was born - at Agnes Creek on De Rose  Hill Station, at a place my people call Kantja. It is Dog Dreaming country.    

 And I know that I would have loved to have grown up there - it would have been a good  place to be a child.   

 I am not a traditional woman.  I have lived almost all of my life in urban environments.    

 I’ve had to come to terms with a white man’s world.    

 And I use man’s quite intentionally, by the way!   

 I’ve been very privileged to be able to succeed in this world, and to be able to devote my  energies to engaging with powerful mainstream institutions to work for the rights and welfare  of my people.   

 But I also know that the loss of my connection with my homelands and family, the attempt to  sever my roots, have produced ongoing anguish in my life, and left wounds which I will never  be able to fully heal.  

  6

 

 There will always be an empty place in my heart for the mother I never really knew, the  family I never had, the country, the language and the culture that were lost to me.   

 We can quibble about semantics all we like, but whether we use the word stolen or removed,  I know that my Aboriginal mother would have had no legal recourse nor any moral support in  resisting our removal.    

 I also know that her grief was unbearable.   

 So, not only has my life been affected deeply by the discriminatory practices of the past.   

 It is also unfortunately true that there is still a culture alive and well in Australia that seeks to  discredit my people.   

 And of course I’m one of the lucky ones. Many of my people’s lives have been totally  ravaged by the arrogance and discrimination of past policies of forcible removal of children.    

 As reports such as the ‘Bringing Them Home’ Report have clearly documented, my people  live with the consequences of European settlement every day of our lives.    

 The consequences of these discriminatory practices and policies are still felt in the day to  day racism that we experience.   

 And let’s be quite clear about this. The policies did seek to discriminate and to place a  higher value on the rights and welfare of one group of people over another.  This is called  racism.   

 And this racism is still deeply embedded in structural ways within the systems of our society.   

 It is felt in the ongoing assumptions of white superiority.   

 It is felt in the shattered connections with family and culture and land.   

 It is felt in the hardship that our people suffer in every sphere - whether in health, housing,  education, or employment.   

 It is felt powerfully in economic disadvantage.   

 It is demonstrated in the lack of political representation at all levels of government.    

 And, it continues to be felt in terms of what is currently happening to our young people, many  of whom are still being institutionalised or feel alienated from their families and communities.   

 It is a legacy that continues to impact on each successive generation, causing immeasurable  grief and trauma and loss of culture.   

 I have consistently argued that we cannot simply see the atrocities and discriminatory  policies of the past as something that happened in the dark ages.    

 Yet many senior politicians do see it this way. Because it is convenient. It lets them off the  hook.    

  7

 To truly acknowledge the ongoing tragic legacy of the past would not only encroach on their  comfort zone - but would also require them to change their priorities.   

 The Government, in response to the situation of Indigenous people, talks about offering  “practical reconciliation”.    

 And of course practical outcomes are desirable. But I want to make some comment about  this idea of practical reconciliation.   

 My first point is that practical action such as providing education, housing, health and jobs is  exactly what governments are there for.   

 It is not a special initiative. It is their core business.   

 My second point is that we went through a ten-year, government initiated process of  Reconciliation.    

 The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation delivered documents and identified clear  recommendations back in the year 2000.   

 However this Government has quite deliberately shut down debate and failed to respond  adequately.   

 The key issue that they fail to grasp - (or deliberately choose to ignore) is that Indigenous  disadvantage is broadly based and interconnected.   

 It is not enough to attend to bits and pieces. There needs to be a cohesive whole-of-government approach.   

 And to use its own lingo - we need performance indicators that match the standards of  wellbeing that are expected for all other citizens of the nation.   

 I fear that an Indigenous under-class is developing in Australia.    

 And there is a very real danger that this under-class will become permanent, their  deprivation and poverty perpetuated by neglect, institutionalised racism and the tunnel vision  of governments.    

 It is interesting to note that Minister Ruddock, who is both the Minister for Immigration,  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, said recently, that he regarded Indigenous Affairs as,  and I quote, “the recreational part of his portfolio”.   

 I’ll resist making a full response to such a comment right now… though I’m tempted!   

 Enough to say that it is right up there, as one of the most offensive (and revealing)  comments he has made.    

 Though I admit, it might be hard to pick the prize-winning remark from this man… there are  so many to choose from!   

 Alongside Reconciliation, one of the biggest social justice challenges facing Australia today  is our treatment of asylum seekers.     

  8

 A climate of fear and populist prejudice has been created around the refugee crisis.    

 Fear and ignorance are very potent forces. They allow some groups of people to demonise  other groups of people. They provide a rationale for racism and ultimately, for warfare.    

 What we are talking about here is a major issue of human rights - and it is an issue that is  going to increasingly confront us in this politically volatile world.   

 And so, it is up to people who recognize the humanity behind the “issues”, to demonstrate  that it is not in our nation’s interest - or anyone’s interest - to take the stance that Australia  has taken.   

 I do not claim that we should have open borders. At this stage of our political evolution as  nation states, that would be unthinkable.   

 Nor do I claim that there is no need for any processes to be in place to respond to people  who arrive desperately seeking safety on our shores.   

 But I do feel very strongly about several issues in relation to this:   

 â¢ People do not need to be detained behind razor wire in detention centres, for months  and years on end, for health and security checks to be carried out.  It should be possible  to achieve this in a matter of a couple of weeks.   

 â¢ Children should not be in detention at all.   

 â¢ Privileged nations like Australia should not tolerate abuses of human rights in any  circumstances or for any reason.   

 â¢ Huge sums of Australian money should not be spent bargaining with other countries to  detain refugees on our behalf - especially where this money would otherwise have been  spent on Aid programs.   

 â¢ People intercepted on their way to Australia should not be treated as cargo to be  diverted and dumped elsewhere.   

 â¢ And, people should at all times be treated with dignity and respect and be given  appropriate support and access to services.   

 These are not outrageous claims. In my view, they should be the baseline of common  decency.   

 It is a myth that asylum seekers would escape in their droves, if they were housed properly  in the community.   

 They desperately want connection and links with authorities, in order to get their visas and  arrangements sorted out.   

 And it is a myth that asylum seekers represent a threat to Australia’s sustainability in terms  of their numbers.  In South Australia, for example, the Government is trying to increase our  population by enticing overseas students to stay.   

  9

 We do not take in very many refugees at all compared to other countries in the world.   

 And, there are far greater numbers of unauthorised residents in Australia who came in the  first place on tourist visas from Europe, and then simply stayed on.   

 It is interesting that this group of “illegals” cause no comment at all from our political leaders!   

 And it reminds me of a talk by Tim Costello I attended recently.  It was called “The Power of  Questions”.    

 One question he raised was particularly potent and provocative. It was and I quote:   

 Do you think that if the asylum seekers who arrived on Australian shores on the Tampa had  been white South African farmers, they would have been turned away at gunpoint?   

 I will leave you to reflect on that.…For me, the answer is very clear!    

 I’m sure it was clear to Tim as well - and it also raised for him, big questions about how  political leaders, who claim to be “confessing Christians”, could have behaved in the way  that they did.   

 All of this relates to questions about what it means to be fully human - and about how we  retrieve compassionate humanity for ourselves as individuals, and as a nation.   

 I am sure that this question is going to be at the heart of many ethical and political issues in  our future.   

 It is commonplace these days to hear that we are a global village. And this may be true, but  as I said earlier, this is usually only thought of in economic terms.   

 There is not the same sort of social connection when it comes to questions of our global  responsibilities.   

 We are not encouraged, for instance, to think much at all about the conditions of the workers  who produce our global brand names.   

 There is little public debate about the responsibilities of first world countries towards the  millions of people in the world who live with poverty, hunger and fear.    

 And, if our country’s response to asylum seekers and refugees is anything to go by, there is  more interest in putting up the barriers and protecting what we’ve got - than seeing  ourselves as part of a much bigger community.   

 It is for all of these reasons, that I see the question of our personal and national ethics as  urgently in need of review and response.   

 I know that there is enormous goodwill from people ‘on the ground’. It is ordinary people  from all walks of life in Australia who have come together to work for justice.   

 People have worked for change in all sorts of diverse ways in their workplaces, in their  professional associations, in local government and in sporting groups.   

  10

 In my public life I have been asked to address the police force, the defence forces, doctors,  health workers, teachers, community groups and even dentists!   

 And everywhere I go I see good people committing themselves to making a difference.    

 And it is this that gives me hope and inspiration.   

 In spite of overwhelming challenges, we need to reclaim our humanity and to make human  rights and justice a priority in our lives, precisely because our leaders will not do it for us.   

 If Australia is to move into the 21st century global arena as a compassionate first world  nation, committed to democratic principles of equity and justice, then we need a breadth of  vision and leadership which is sadly lacking today.     

 And we need to demand this loudly.   

 Many sectors of the Australian public have been complacent, if not complicit, in walking with  their Prime Minister along an ethical fault-line.   

 It is time to stand up and be counted and to vigorously reject the lies and half-truths we have  been told in recent years, and to assert some control about where we as a nation are  headed.   

 I am sure that people of good will such as you can make the difference.   

 As Margaret Mead once said, and I quote:   

 Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.   

 Thank you.
