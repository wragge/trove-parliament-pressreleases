 Vanstone ducks consequences of illogical  refugee policy 

 9th December  2004 

 Senator Kerry Nettle confronted the Minister for Immigration in  question time today over her view that Iraqi asylum seekers should go  home when International Organisation for Migration IOM officials on  Nauru have told Iraqi detainees that they cannot go home.    

 "The Minister refused to acknowledge that her call for Iraqi asylum  seekers to go home was misleading," Senator Nettle said.    

 Last week 14 Iraqis were refused visas and then attempted to sign  'voluntary return' forms. They were told by IOM officials in Nauru that  they could not return to Iraq because the 'borders are closed'.    

 "The Minister surely knows that Iraq's borders are closed. Her  performance in question time today only serves to confirm that her  decision to keep these people locked up on Nauru is inexplicably  callous.    

 "The Minister would rather joke about Christmas in her answer than  face up to the horrific situation she has left these 14 Iraqis facing.    

 "I am appalled at this refusal of the Minister to deal honestly with the  consequences of government policy.    

 "The UNHCR has made a request the all Iraqi asylum seekers be  released from detention until the security situation in Iraq improves.  The Greens call on the government to accept the logic of this  argument and release these individuals."
