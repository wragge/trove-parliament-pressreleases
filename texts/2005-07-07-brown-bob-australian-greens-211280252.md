 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania  

 Angry Ambassador invited to elaborate  

 7th Jul 2005 

 China’s angry ambassador Madam Fu Ying was invited to elaborate on  her outburst in Brisbane today when the Senate committee inquires  into the defection of diplomat Chen Yonglin in two weeks time, Greens  Senator Bob Brown said today.  "As well as her condemnation of Mr Chen, I would certainly like to hear  her talk about the 250 000 prisoners in ‘education with labour’ camps  in China," Senator Brown said.  "Her vilification of Mr Chen probably indicates she has given up trying  to get him back to China by fair means or foul.  "Chen Yonglin has repeatedly said how much he loves China but  dislikes the authoritarian dictatorship in Beijing. Madam Fu’s outburst  will not undermine his love of country," Senator Brown said.
