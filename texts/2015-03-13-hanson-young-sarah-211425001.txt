 MEDIA RELEASE

 Dutton deals with Cambodia while Christian refugees persecuted   

 The Abbott government shouldn’t proceed with its doomed Cambodian refugee deal,  especially considering the recent illegal forced return of Vietnamese refugees, the  Australian Greens have said.   

 “The Abbott government is turning a blind eye to appalling human rights abuses, just to  get this dirty deal done,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.   

 “Cambodia can barely care for its own people and has a track record of abusing  refugees’ rights. Just last month Cambodian officials hunted down and forcefully  returned Christian refugees to face persecution in Vietnam.   

 “The Abbott government should give up on this ill-fated and costly refugee deal  immediately.   

 “Forcing refugees to choose between a life of torment on Nauru or a life of poverty in  Cambodia is appalling. Peter Dutton is simply putting these families, who have fled from  war and persecution, in a desperate lose-lose situation.   

 “Australia should be leading a genuine regional solution and working with countries to  improve conditions, increase refugee processing speeds and find them safe places to  live. Instead the Abbott government is bullying refugees and leaning on our  impoverished neighbours.”
