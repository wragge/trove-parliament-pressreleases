 Lantern parade a tribute to Queensland’s new  arrivals

 6 June 2014

 The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services, Senator Concetta Fierravanti­

 Wells, says Brisbane’s Luminous Lantern Parade is an ideal opportunity to welcome 

 Queensland’s new residents.

 Formerly known as the ‘Refugee Lantern Parade’, this is the first year it has been known as the 

 ‘Luminous Lantern Parade’ with a wider focus on welcoming all new arrivals to the Sunshine 

 State.

 Senator Fierravanti­Wells, who has special responsibility for Settlement Services and  Multicultural Affairs, said it was a real pleasure to attend the event.

 “The parade used a magnificent display of colours, lanterns, music and dancing to celebrate 

 the many positive contributions of migrants and refugees as members of Queensland society,” 

 Senator Fierravanti­Wells said.

 “I am pleased that this event was so well received by the community.

 “Since October 1945, more than 7.5 million people have migrated to Australia—over 800 000 

 of these people arrived under the Humanitarian Programme.

 “Migrants and refugees make positive contributions every day to the social, cultural and 

 economic fabric of our society.

 “The parade is another great example of the hospitality of Queenslanders and this is a 

 wonderful celebration of the state’s diversity.
