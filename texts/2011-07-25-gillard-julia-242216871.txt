 PRIME MINISTER  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  CITIZENSHIP   

 AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA SIGN TRANSFER DEAL   

 The Australian and Malaysian governments today signed a groundbreaking  arrangement to combat people smuggling and provide protection to an  additional 4,000 genuine refugees.   

 The arrangement demonstrates the resolve of Australia and Malaysia to break  the people smugglers’ business model, stop them profiting from human  misery, and stop people risking their lives at sea.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Malaysian  Minister of Home Affairs, Dato' Seri Hishammuddin bin Tun Hussein, signed  the arrangement documents at a formal ceremony in Kuala Lumpur today.   

 The arrangement provides for the transfer from Australia to Malaysia of up to  800 irregular maritime arrivals and formalises Australia’s commitment to  accept 1,000 additional genuine refugees from Malaysia every year for the  next four years. This increases Australia’s overall annual humanitarian intake  to 14,750 places.   

 This is a bold and innovative arrangement between two countries that have a  long-standing and strong cooperative relationship.   

 After today, 800 people arriving in Australia by boat will not be processed in  Australia. They will instead be taken to Malaysia where they will have to wait  alongside more than 90,000 other asylum seekers for their claims to be  assessed.   

 Meanwhile, an additional 4,000 people considered by UNHCR to be most in  need of resettlement will be given the opportunity to start new lives in  Australia.   

 The arrangement reaffirms Malaysia’s commitment that transferees will be  treated with dignity and respect in accordance with human rights standards,  that it will respect the principle of non-refoulement, the key tenet of the  Refugee Convention, and that asylum claims will be considered by the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).   

 The transfer arrangement between Australia and Malaysia also provides that:  â¢ Arrivals will be subject to pre-transfer assessments to ensure fitness and  suitability for transfer, along with basic biometric testing; 

 â¢ Transferees will be lawful in Malaysia and provided with exemption under  the Malaysian Immigration Act and Passports Act;  â¢ Transferees will be initially accommodated in a transit centre in Malaysia  for up to 45 days, with support from the UNHCR and the International 

 Organization for Migration;  â¢ Following initial processing, transferees will move into the community,  with work rights, access to education and health care; and  â¢ Transferees will receive no preferential treatment in the processing of 

 their claims or arrangements for resettlement over other asylum seekers  in Malaysia.   

 The UNHCR has been closely consulted on the transfer arrangement, and  both the UNHCR and the IOM will play a vital role in its implementation.   

 Oversight and advisory committees, including representatives from Australia,  Malaysia, UNHCR, IOM and others, will provide ongoing advice to both  governments on day-to-day management of the arrangement and the ongoing  welfare of transferees.   

 Under the arrangement signed today, those who arrived in Australia before 25  July will not be transferred to Malaysia. Consequently, the people who arrived  prior to today’s announcement, currently being detained on Christmas Island, 

 will now be processed in Australia.    

 Malaysia is a key regional partner in the Bali Process and this arrangement  represents a significant step under the Regional Cooperation Framework  established at the Bali Process Ministerial Conference in March this year.   

 This is a true burden-sharing arrangement in line with the principles of  collective responsibility and cooperation that underpin the Regional  Cooperation Framework.
