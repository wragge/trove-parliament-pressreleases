  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR NICK BOLKUS,  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAm5, ON THE ISSUE OF 

  EAST TIMORESE ASYLUM SEEKERS -PERm 10 OCTOBER 1995 

  Journalist: Minister can you comment on the plight of the East Timorese boat people? 

  Bolkus: Sure, I think the story in this morning Australian is a monumental beat up; it's 

  one that has taken them seven months to get to. The issue actually arose at the instigation 

  of the Refugee Review Tribunal some seven or eight months ago when the Tribunal raised 

  the question of citizenship. Now I can give an assurance that anyone in Australia seeking 

  asylum status will be treated under our law, they will be assessed against the internationally 

  accepted definition of refugee, the United Nations definition, and they will be assessed 

  without interference by Government. It's an assurance that can be given, my language may 

  be a bit more robust than what Gru:eth Evans said this morning but I am very much reflecting 

  on what he had to say. We will not interfere in the process. ' People have the right to be 

  assessed by the Refugee Review Tribunal in accordance with our law, and assessed on the 

  basis of the UN definition "refugee". The matter arose here some months ago; we're not 

  talking about 18 people, we are talking about some 1300 people who came to Australia from 

  East Timor, mos~ of whom came as visitors but decided to stay and seek asylum status, and 

  the reality is that those groups crying out today, have been aware -and some of them I have 

  had discussions with some six months ago - they have been aware of the impact of 

  Portuguese citizenship laws on the defmition of refugee. Now they've also made the 

  allegation that we are hypocritical. The reality is there is absolutely no inconsistency 

  between the application of citizenship law and. any impact on sovereignty. You know for 

  instance we have 5 million Australians who have dual citizenship, and half a million 

  Australians of Italian background who have Italian citizenship, or the right to it, as well as 

  ours. Now no-one is arguing that the 150 countries from which our dual citizens come have 

  sovereignty rights over Australia. It's a ridiculous argument. Whoever claims that because 

  Portugal gives some people from East Timor citizenship f!1eans that we recognise Portuguese 

  sovereignty over East Timor is ridiculous. 

  Journalist: A lot of people would see that as a lame excuse by using their status as 

  Portuguese.

  BoOms: Yes, people are very quick to react here, quick to get emotional. The reality 

  is there has been no interference and the reality also is that under the international defmition 

  of refugee, a definition which has been in existence for 40 years with universal application, 

  people have got rights and peopl~ have responsibilities and the impact of citizenship laws will 

  be assessed in accordance with that definition without interference. 

  Journalist: So where's the issue at now, what's the next step? 

  Bolkus: The issue is where it should be, it's before the Tribunal. The Tribunal has 

  raised the matter; they've got advice; they'll be getting more advice and it will be up to them 

  to decide how to treat the people individually. Cases are at different stages. If they are 

  appealed to the Tribunal, then the Tribunal will deal with them as it sees fit and according 

  to law.
