 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has received an update from West Papua that five  teenagers in West Papua have been shot by the Indonesian Military (TNI) which resulted in four  deaths today.    

 "It is particularly disgusting that it appears the five people shot were school children," Senator  Nettle said.    

 "Minister Downer must investigate, what on the face of it, appear to be reprisals for the recent  arrival of asylum seekers in Australia,"   Senator Nettle said.
