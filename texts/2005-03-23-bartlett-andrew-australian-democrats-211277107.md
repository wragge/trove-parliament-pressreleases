 Democrats Welcome Limited Release but Condemn  Ongoing Jail for Asylum Seekers Pursuing Rights

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed the decision to release some asylum seekers from  detention, but say they will continue to campaign until every asylum seeker is released from  detention, including those on Nauru and Christmas Island. 

 Democrats Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, also says all asylum seekers living in the  community (rather than just those effected by todays announcement) must have the right to  work and access Medicare, rather than be left to live off charity for months or years.

 There are many other asylum seekers already in the community, including families with  children, who have had to live a hand-to-mouth existence for years while they wait for their  claims to be finally determined, Senator Bartlett said.

 The Democrats also condemned the Governments decision to keep people locked up if they are  challenging decisions through review or the courts. 

 Refusing to free people if they pursue their legal rights is a disgraceful form of blackmail which  the Government would not dare apply to Australians.

 Many refugees have only been released after years in prison because they challenged wrong  decisions. The Government is trying another form of brutal intimidation to try to force refugees  to give up.

 Senator Bartlett made a special plea for the 54 people remaining on Nauru to also be released.

 When I last visited Nauru over 12 months ago, there were over 200 people there and almost all  were in a state of enormous despair. I shudder to think of the state of mind of the small number  who have been left behind. The people on Nauru are the leftover remnants of the pre-election  battles of 2001. In many ways, they have suffered more than anyone else because of the  isolation and the calculated destruction of hope. The financial and human cost of keeping them  locked away can no longer be justified. They should be released into the Australian community,  as so many of their fellow detainees were in 2004. 

 There is no reason to keep any asylum seeker locked up unless it can clearly be demonstrated  that someone presents a safety or health risk to the Australian community, Senator Bartlett  concluded.
