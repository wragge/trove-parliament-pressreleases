 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday 3 September   

 Greens condemn Oppositions proposal to turn back Sri Lankan refugees   

 The Australian Greens have today condemned the Oppositions call to deport vulnerable refugees  back to Sri Lanka.    

 “Tony Abbott’s proposal to refuse Sri Lankan asylum seekers assessment and protection is in  complete contradiction to our obligations under international law and is a fundamental breach of  the Refugee Convention,” said Greens’ Immigration and Human Rights spokesperson Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young.    

 “Abbott’s Coalition either does not understand what our obligations are under the Convention, or  even worse, they simply do not care.   

 “This latest brain snap by the Coalition is simply extraordinary- it is illegal, dangerous and blatantly  discriminatory.   

 “Refusing desperate people protection prior to having their claims assessed is cruel and breaches  our obligations under the Refugee Convention.   

 “Australia has an obligation under the Refugee Convention to assess all asylum seekers who arrive  on our shores, irrespective of their mode of arrival.
