 New South Wales’ Share of Settler Arrivals Declines

 VPS 006/2005

 Australia attracted the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 More than 111 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2003-04, an increase of nearly 20 000 from the previous year’s total of 93 914.

 However, at 36 per cent, the New South Wales’ share of total settler arrivals to Australia in 2003-04 was the smallest since 1983-84.

 Just over 40 000 people arrived and settled in New South Wales in 2003-04, down nearly 7000 from the 2000-01 total of 46 745.

 ‘The decrease is in line with the Australian Government’s efforts to encourage migrants to settle where they are most needed,’ Senator Vanstone  said.

 ‘Although the latest figures for 03/04 show a marked decrease in New South Wales settler arrivals compared to three years ago, we have seen rises  in all the other states and territories,’ she said.

 Nationally, over the past decade there has been a nearly 60 per cent increase in settler arrivals, with well over 200 countries represented. The  increase to NSW has been half the national rate.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 Australia-wide, the largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South  Africa, the Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe,’ she said.
