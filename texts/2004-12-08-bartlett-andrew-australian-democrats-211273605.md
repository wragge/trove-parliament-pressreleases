 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1124 WEDNESDAY 8 DECEMBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  Detention Centre Debacles Continue Australian Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett has expressed extreme concern about the continuing acts of distress in Australian detention centres. Senator Bartlett today spoke in the Senate about reports of more hunger strikes in Baxter detention centre and his recent visit to the Vietnamese asylum seekers who have been jailed on Christmas Island for nearly 18 months. Senator Bartlett said "There have been very few visitors to the Vietnamese people locked up on Christmas Island and the people there feel forgotten and very vulnerable.  Among the 43 people detained there, 9 are children. "In addition to the forgotten people still detained in inaccessible centres on Christmas Island and Nauru, the traumas at Baxter also continue. "Following on the heels of hunger strikes by Sri Lankan detainees, there are now reports of hunger strikes by Iranian detainees who have sewn their lips together. In a separate development, 10 Arab Ahwazian Iranians (also called "Indigenous" Iranians) have issued their own declaration and also part of a hunger strike. "This Government cannot continue to punish these people by denying them protection and leaving them to languish in detention. "Many of the people in Baxter have been locked up for four to five years and their mental health is suffering immensely.  "There are no legitimate security or health reasons to keep these people locked up.  Hunger strikes and other acts of desperation are almost inevitable when people are left in situations of fear and hopelessness." "These people should be granted protection so that we can get on with their lives," concluded Senator Bartlett.  Media Contact - Rowena Bew - 0400 729 555
