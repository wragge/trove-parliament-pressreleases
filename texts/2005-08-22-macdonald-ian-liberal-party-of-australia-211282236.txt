 University of Third Age

 Cleveland, Brisbane, Queensland - 22 August 2005

 Good morning ladies and gentlemen and great to be with you and what a  fabulous University actually - to get people with experience and maturity in  life, together in one room to learn no doubt, but also in doing that to pass on  to others and to the four of us here today, I guess, your thoughts on the  way we can make our nation, our state and local government areas all the  better. So thanks for inviting me along and thanks for having me. 

 I recognise Kevin Linguard and John English and Andrew Bartlett. I see a lot  of Andrew in the Federal Parliament. I don't quite see so much of the other  two, but obviously my approach to support for senior citizens comes from  the national level. We of course believe that senior citizens - the same for  our youth, the same as in fact, for every Australian, deserve to have a  strong economy. Without a strong economy you can do nothing. A strong  economy gives the national government the ability to invest in  improvements in health and education and in things like assistance for the  ageing in our society, the infirm in our society and helps us to do all the  things that we need to do as a national government.

 So our main task since we were elected government in 1996 was to get the  economy right. They required us to pay off some  $90 billion of debt we inherited and the government debt was  $96 billion before we paid $90 billion off that. And that means instead of  paying interest rates on that amount we can invest those savings in  Australia.

 We have also tried to ensure that every Australian who wants a job can get a  job and that means we are providing our economy and economic climate to  encourage employment in our nation. That means helping small business - it  means trying to get governments off the backs of business, particularly small  business because it is small business which creates the jobs that employ  people. That is something we have been very keen on and something that I  would like to think we have been successful in doing. We have tried to keep  interest rates down. Now I know there are some of you in this room that  that particular policy doesn't quite suit personally because those of you  would like interest rates to be up, but when interest rates are high, inflation  is high, and the cost of living keeps going up. We have been able to achieve  low interest rates, low inflation and that has encouraged investment in  Australia. So that I think again is very, very important. What we have tried to do as a national government is to make Australians 

 secure. Secure in their own rights, secure in the knowledge that they can get  help and medicine whenever they need it. Secure in the knowledge that their  children and grandchildren can have a good education, an education that  does help young people look forward to life and helps them get the learning  and understanding that is needed to make for a rewarding and fulfilling  future.

 I have been in Canberra for the last fortnight and it is minus  3 degrees and I picked up one of those bugs so it is lovely to be back in  Queensland. So we want to manage a good economy and we want to provide  security for our nation. 

 The biggest problem we face of course in this horrible world that we  sometimes see overseas, is terrorism. Terrorism hasn't struck the Australian  mainland as yet. But there is no reason why we should be different to  anywhere else in the world. It has affected Australia badly with that  horrendous incident in Bali, but we as a government believe that we have to  do our bit to save the world from terrorism. It is a major fight. It is not one  we can fix in one week, one month, one year or even perhaps a decade. We  have to play our part in the world community to help defeat terrorism.

 We do that in many ways, we do that by helping those countries to alleviate  poverty. We do that by forming alliances with big countries and little  countries, other nations big and small. We have become very, very close to  the Americans and we have renewed our ties with the United Kingdom and  Europe in recent times. We have also a very significant and equal  arrangement with our Asian neighbours. I always say - I live in North  Queensland - I live closer to the Indonesian capital then I do to the  Australian capital. There are 200 million people in Indonesia. It is a very big  country - a Muslim country. But we have to interact with them. 

 As Fisheries Minister I interact with them to keep their illegal fishermen off  our fishing grounds and we keep arresting a lot of Indonesian fishing boats.  But we do try to form good relationships with those countries to keep  Australia secure. We are determined in all aspects to keep our borders  secure.

 Remember years ago it was a real problem with boat people. People who  illegally wanted to enter Australia. We have the world's best refugee  programme. We are very proud of that - but there were people wanting to  jump the queue and we, and I think most Australians, didn't believe that was  right so we wanted to make them abide by the rules. We wanted to stop that  flow of illegal boat people - and we have. We have come under a lot of  criticism at times, but I think we achieved that goal of nil illegal arrivals.  Wherever we go we want to ensure that our borders are secure.

 Again as Fisheries Minister we have some territory down near the Antarctica -  Heard and McDonald Islands where we have a very valuable fishery. People  were coming in from Spain and Europe and robbing our fisheries. Not only  destroying fish stock and affecting the ocean ecology but also taking 

 something that was Australian and also violating our borders - even down in  that territory of Australia. 

 We do want to ensure that as best as possible we can promote Australian  products and as Forestry Minister I want Australians to use Australian forest  products - we manage some of the best forests in the world and they are  sustainable. If we don't use our own well managed forests we import all of  those wood and paper products from places from Indonesia, the Solomons,  Malaysia and New Guinea where the forest has just been ravaged and raped  and have been destroyed - not to the benefit of the local people I might add  but to the benefit of international criminal cartels. So we want to try to  ensure all imports are legally and sustainably harvested, and that way we try  to help right across the board. 

 Mr Chairman - who is keeping the time? How are we going?  Well some of you who are a little older than me - not many I don't think.  Some of the people up here are about my age, I think?  The particular things we have done for the older people, I don't know  whether you want me to read through things like:  $321 million investment over five years for early intervention and additional  care services and carer training to improve the quality of the life of people  with dementia. We have a five fold increase for funding for the national  respite for the carers programme. We have introduced a bonus of $1,000 for  carers, which many of you will be aware of, an additional $196 million  investment in new cancer screening programmes and awareness campaigns.  An additional $79 million for health services for veterans. There are new  initiatives with the Medicare rebate of 100 per cent of the scheduled fee,  investing in after hours GP services, increasing the private health insurance  rebate and so the list goes on. Tax relief to increase rewards for working and  saving to help the economy grow, welfare to work measures. 

 As you know we are also looking at the vast resource in Australia of mature  and experienced people who can find some full time work and still do have a  great contribution to make to our society and we need them I might say -  we have a real skills shortage around the country at the moment and we  hope to work out ways of getting mature experienced people back into the  workforce in a way that doesn't impact adversely on their pensions or other  rights and entitlements. It is something we need to work on but it is  something we understand and we do work towards a better system.

 Ladies and gentlemen we can talk for hours about these sort of things but I  think my time has expired. Thank you Mr Chairman and thank you for  listening to me and I look forward to hearing your questions later on.
