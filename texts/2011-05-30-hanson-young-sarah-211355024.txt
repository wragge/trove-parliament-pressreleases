 House debates Greens motion condemning  Malaysian asylum seeker deal  The House of Representatives has today begun debating a Greens’ motion condemning the  Gillard Government’s proposed human swap deal with Malaysia. 

 “The Gillard government can claim the unsigned deal’s a great humanitarian gesture to take  4,000 people, but there are no guarantees that the human rights of 800 asylum seekers will be  protected as nothing has been changed in Malaysian domestic law,” Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “The Malaysian arrangement is a ridiculously expensive option compared to community  detention options on the Australian mainland.” 

 Sen. Hanson-Young successfully moved a motion condemning the deal in the Senate earlier  this month.  

 Greens MP and Member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, this morning moved the motion in the  House of Representatives, seconded by Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie. 

 “This deal to expel 800 asylum seekers from Christmas Island to Malaysia should be  scrapped because it will violate the human rights of vulnerable people and breaches our  international obligations,” Mr Bandt said. 

 “The House should condemn the Gillard government’s proposal and ensure that there is a  genuine regional approach to solving this problem, not cutting side deals which swap the  human rights of one group of people for another.”
