 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview with Steve Bracks, Premier of Victoria Subjects: Nursing, Medicare Alliance, Aged Care, Refugees, GST

 Transcript - Melbourne, Victoria - 8 November 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: I have to say, that doesn't usually happen to me at press conferences. I take it there are some folk here, well, I know there are folk here who are not necessarily here to interview me. But what I wanted to do today, I appreciate enormously the fact that Premier Bracks is with me here today, and I appreciate too, the RMIT and all of you who have come here to make the facility available for me to have a look at nurses in the middle of exams and what it is that you all do, to make a few points about what I think is a critical profession in our society, to sign the Medicare Alliance and the money which is pledged to go into the hospital system here in Victoria, and I do thank the Premier for being part of that negotiation which is so important for the future of health in our community.

 Can I say something first, about nurses before I get onto other things. There's a nurse shortage in this country and there are many factors underlying it but there's one thing that's absolutely certain - it has to be cured. There's one thing that is absolutely certain - it has to be cured. And in this election campaign, in very straightened financial circumstances, because we have had to keep our promises within the framework of what the budget can afford - and we have done that - we are nevertheless going to address these issues, these critical issues.

 I am announcing that our Medicare Alliance, through it, will be spending some $52 million on improving, firstly, the image of the nursing profession as an attractive profession for people to join. $42 million on HECS-funded post-graduate nursing positions, scholarships for people working in areas of workforce need, in this critical area of workforce need.

 We're also going to spend $109 million on reducing the wages gap between nurses and carers in the aged care sector. That is absolutely critical. $105 million on what we're calling 35,000 Knowledge Nation apprenticeships. I think people think that those apprenticeships are basically folk in engineering labs, or software, or something like that. In fact, they go to those areas where skills are now required in the

 community, indeed, aged care carers are among those whose apprenticeships would be funded in this way - the folk that we've just seen doing their exams for Division Two nursing qualifications. Exactly that sort of person is what we envisage in relation to these apprenticeships.

 So, this is a comprehensive plan to tackle a yawning gap in health and aged care in this community. It's not all that we're doing in that area but it is directed at what is one of the principle problems - that is the need to attract nurses in this profession, and a need to get more carers into aged care. These are critical issues for this nation. Only we address them.

 Our political opponents, on this and health issues generally, say that that's all there is as far as they're concerned. When you ask them why they say that, they say, well that's because there's the GST. The GST does not fund these things but you're entitled to assume that if you argue that it does, you're intending to do something else with the GST. And that's where we see a link between this and what Costello previously said about the need to put GST on food. Even there, it's no good for the Commonwealth Government to walk away from these things.

 In the same way as the Commonwealth Government has to accept responsibility for those who engage in our education processes and for all our kids, we in the Commonwealth Government have to accept responsibility for all our people in need in terms of health care and aged care. That is our job at the national level. We accept responsibility. We don't run away from it. And we are obliged in an election campaign, to tell people what we intend to do in the course of the next three years to solve the problems that they know are there. I've been very proud of the fact that uniquely in this election campaign that is exactly what the Australian Labor Party has been doing.

 We're also launching here the Medicare Alliance in Victoria and what that Medicare Alliance in Victoria will mean is increased services in four outer-suburban hospitals - Epping, Maroondah, Frankston and Werribee - additional funds for convalescent care for aged care persons, who are obliged to stay in hospitals.

 One of the things the Commonwealth has been doing that is so wrong in relation to aged care, has been making the States carry the burden of it in the public hospitals. I mean, there's more than a few nursing homes worth of people in public hospitals here in Victoria who really ought to be in nursing homes but because the beds aren't available, aren't there. We want to ensure that the States get properly supported when that happens.

 There's $21 million for six radiotherapy machines here. There is a 10,000 shortfall identified by the radiologists for people who could benefit from radiotherapy who don't get it in this country as a result of an absence of those machines. There's $14 million to purchase medical equipment for rural hospitals. I've already announced $15 million for an emergency department at the Angliss Hospital. There's $11 million to improve mental health services, $7 million for improved maternity care and services for new mothers having difficulties, and $6 million for community-based palliative care services. That's before you get to what we intend to do about people's teeth. We announced, of course, policies in that regard.

 For aged care generally, there would be a substantial share of that $200 million that we're talking about providing, coming in on top of the money that is there for capital expenditure on nursing homes to start to address the phantom beds problem, start to address the shortfall in aged care here in Victoria.

 So, without further ado, I'd invite the Premier to sign this pledge of ours.

 (pledge signing)

 BRACKS: Could I first of all, thank Kim Beazley very much for signing the Medicare Alliance with the Victorian Government. We are very proud of the fact that we have in the leadership of the Labor Party someone so committed to public health. Isn't it refreshing to have someone committed to public health, public education, and to ensure that the States and the Commonwealth work together.

 And that's what the Medicare Alliance is about. It's about agreeing on growth, agreeing on funding and making sure the resources are put there together to meet the demands of the future. And contrast that to the existing Howard Government which unilaterally decides what sort of funding it has for the States, not based on any great prediction of growth, but simply of what they want to put out there for public health. This is a contrast, this is a difference, this is the sort of arrangement you can expect with a Beazley Labor Government and State Labor Governments working together cooperatively to make a difference on health, on education, and this Medicare Alliance is an example of that.

 I am very pleased, Kim, that we've signed together an agreement for an extra $134 million to the Victorian health system. I'm very pleased about that. I must admit, it won't be our only call on you for these arrangements but the call will be a cooperative one, one we agree on, one we work together on to improve the health system in this country and in Victoria, and I think what you've done in ensuring that health needs go out to the outer suburbs in Melbourne where it's needed, and resources going where it's needed, and to assist us in the States in recruiting nurses so we can open beds. It's so important for the future. Congratulations, we're happy to work with you and after Saturday, on your election victory, we look forward to a cooperative arrangement in improving our health system in Victoria. Thank you very much.

 JOURNALIST: Just in relation to special purpose payments, do you suspect that the Howard Government would change the arrangements, putting pressure on the States to raise the rate of GST?

 BRACKS: Well, I've got no doubt that they'll be under pressure if the Coalition Government is returned and they will seek to use the GST as a replacement for special purpose grants. I'm sure that is their agenda and you will see a renegotiation of those matters, and some difficulty, of course, at a State level, though those special purposes assistance grants.

 JOURNALIST: Would you, as a Labor government, feel the pressure on you to raise the rate of the GST? And do you want to renegotiate the deal that Victoria gets for the GST?

 BRACKS: Well, I must say, on the deal that Victoria gets for the GST, we get no net benefit, no proceeds from the GST until the year 2007-2008. We, are on an equivalent basis to what we had under the Federal Assistance Grants, the old grants that we had previously, because of the arrangements the Howard Government has set, so we get no benefit. In fact, all the growth from the GST does not come to Victoria, does not come to NSW, until 2007-2008 so the growth goes to the Federal Government. It goes into their coffers. So, we're not seeking a renegotiation. What we're seeking is a fair deal, a fair deal all around, a GST plus other grants. I mean, the GST is only one component.

 JOURNALIST: So, just in relation to special purpose payments, though, would you vote for an increase in the rate of the GST if you felt that Victoria needed that money?

 BRACKS: What we would do is ensure that those special purpose grants are kept.

 JOURNALIST: Have you seen the video of the boat people yet? Are you going to ask to see it and if it proves to be authentic, is it going to … the last couple of days of campaigning for you?

 BEAZLEY: Firstly, I haven't seen the video. Secondly, I would expect to see it at some point of time. From what I have been told about the video is that it is pretty inconclusive about what it has to say and what I have been doing in this campaign - I think pretty successfully - is bringing the election round to talking about a multiplicity of issues and not just this. I know there is a certain fascination in the media with the issues that are associated with the illegal entry of migrants into this country. But I also know that the Australian people there is a fascination with other things. There is a real concern about what is happening with health care in this country. There is a real concern about what the Government might do with the Goods and Services Tax. There is a real concern out there for Telstra. There is a real concern out there for education, a real concern about what is happening in public schools - and quite frankly that is starting to bite - and the desperation of our political opponents is a measure of that.

 JOURNALIST: But isn't it Labor's worst nightmare - the last three days of the campaign dominated by boat people?

 BEAZLEY: That is not happening so that is not a concern. The simple fact of the matter is ….

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

 BEAZLEY: But I am also asked about other things fortunately. I am also being asked about other matters. Not everybody in the media is a servant of the Liberals.

 JOURNALIST: Boat people is the issue that has engaged Neville Wran and Malcolm Fraser and a whole bunch of former political leaders. Is this just a concern that the public …

 BEAZLEY: The public are concerned about that. The public are also concerned for hospitals, nurses and teachers, public schools. The public is concerned with the broad range of things. I have actually found it quite useful in a lengthy political career to be able to talk about a wide variety of issues. The fact of the matter is and one of the reasons why I talk about a wide variety of issues is to say to the Australian people I can handle it if I have to, issues in relation to boat people because as I said at the outset of this campaign security abroad and security at home - so I can do that - and I can also do these other things as well. Mr Howard cannot. It will be interesting to see if Mr Howard's press conference today at the Press Club whether or not - there are those in the media now to confront Mr Howard on what he proposes to do about aged care, when his figures are a mess, his policy is a mess. Will they have the courage to confront Mr Howard about what is being done about public education and the fact that he has said there is no more as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Confront Mr Howard and his intention on the Goods and Services Tax on Telstra. It will be an interesting test this today.

 JOURNALIST: My understanding of the video is that it shows someone jumping off but it doesn't show people throwing their children off. Now the way this video was used in the first instance, particularly by Peter Reith and held back ... evidence of people throwing their children off the boat, and the fact that it doesn't show it, is it in your mind that the Government has been ….. the Australian public?

 BEAZLEY: I haven't seen the video and it would be silly for me to comment if I haven't seen the video. What I understand is the video is inconclusive about all those matters. I, like you, tend to take Governments on trust when they are talking about operational matters. I think most people do and so it will be interesting to see what the video reveals in that regard. But it is in the nature of these sorts of

 things I think at the end of the day you are unlikely to find things absolutely conclusive one way or the other.

 JOURNALIST: Are you surprised Reith hasn't seen it?

 BEAZLEY: I am surprised that Reith hasn't seen it, yes I am surprised at that.

 JOURNALIST: By extension, do you think he has been using this whole thing for political advantage? If the Minister hasn't seen it … he has certainly hinted that he has seen it.

 BEAZLEY: I think you actually ought to have a chat to him about it. He has been cheerful to chat to everybody else about life in the course of this election campaign. You ought to have a chat to him.

 JOURNALIST: Why isn't Labor making these points about - I mean if the Minister, it's an international incident and you are in an election campaign, worth stressing this point?

 BEAZLEY: I suppose, Matt, that it is because in an election campaign you deal with everything, you deal with everything and you tend to take too at face value what people have to say about operational matters and you don't believe you are being deceived. I think that what you ought to do is to direct a few questions about that.

 JOURNALIST: In relation to the rhetoric that has been used during this campaign, we have heard Mr Howard tell us that our waters will be awash with asylum seekers if the policy is abandoned. We have also heard that there may be terrorists on board some of these crews. Do you think that any of the rhetoric is appealing to latent racism among Australian voters?

 BEAZLEY: Let me deal with each of them. Firstly, you have got to have proper border protection, Sam, simple as that. This is not a new thing as far as Australians are concerned. Really since the days of the Vietnam war or the conclusion of it, Australia has had to confront the possibility of an unconstrained refugee problem approaching our shores.

 Now successive Australian Governments have successfully negotiated a way through that problem. At the heart of it there has been preparedness of an Australian Government to accept a generous refugee cap - 12,000 by international comparison is actually generous refugee cap. That is agreed on a bipartisan basis. In the process that you accept that you also want to make sure it is orderly in order to sustain public support for the things it is that you are doing. And we have had it orderly. We have been able as a Labor Party in office to negotiate a good outcome as far as orderly entry of people to this country is concerned. John Howard lost control of it and he struggled to get back in control of it and the issues and the mechanisms by which he has done that have been part of the issues in the course of this election campaign. But only one of them.

 Let me deal with the question of terrorism. It is necessary for this country to be vigilant in relation to terrorism. It is necessary for us to have a thorough going understanding of what vigilance requires. I was pleased to see the other day that John Broom who has got half an idea on these things - as an ex-head of the National Crime Authority - took a look at the proposals we have put forward on protecting our people against terrorism and those that the Liberals have put forward on protecting our people against terrorism and he has said that ours are better. I am not surprised because I think we have a better understanding of these issues than Mr Howard. And I know this - and we all know this really - as a result of those horrible events of September 11 and the subsequent revelations of the FBI inquiry as to how the people who

 committed those heinous crimes got into the United States. They arrived with good haircuts, in good suits, with impeccable credentials, by air and they did so with impeccable credentials that were nevertheless false. And this is what we need to deal with in regard to terrorism. So what I think is possible is that if we ever confront a terrorist threat in this country, that is the way it will happen.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the Prime Minister's view and Phillip Ruddock's fear that there could be terrorists on the boat ...

 BEAZLEY: I only go on the briefings that I have been given and on the briefings that I have been given that is not an indication but do I think that there is the possibility that we will confront terrorism in this country, we have to be vigilant about it and we have to deal with it at the sources from which it is likely to come and I suggest that you take a look at Labor's excellent policy because it does exactly that.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, one of the reasons that you've given for protecting the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is that it lifts pressure off public hospitals. If you pledge to keep the rebate, do you also pledge to keep the rebate for ancillary cover, which plays no role at all in lifting the pressure off public hospital waiting lists. And, can I also ask, can you confirm that if removed taxpayers would be saved $600 to $800 million a year just on ancillary cover?

 BEAZLEY: Yes to those first questions you made, except the last. We are going to sustain the private health cover that is there. We don't think it does enough for public hospitals. It may help to some extent, but it doesn't do enough. There is an element of the agreement which threatens public hospitals, however. That is the element which says that now the current levels of accessing private health insurance, the Commonwealth would be entitled to take a billion dollars off the States. When we re-negotiate the Medicare agreements with States, to pick up the Alliance that we have just signed, and the other concerns that we have with the States, we will eliminate that clause. So, the States don't have that sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. It remains an open question as to what, were they to secure re-election, our political opponents might do with that clause because, of course, the Health Minister, who has previously said he wouldn't do anything about it, will no longer be Health Minister from a day after Saturday.

 We will be altering nothing in regard to private health insurance, we drew a line under that. What we will be doing is switching over to deal with the public hospital system in the way in which we've suggested during this election campaign.

 JOURNALIST: … rebate where with ancillary cover it doesn't nothing to alleviate public hospitals.

 BEAZLEY: What that private health cover does across the board is underpin a certain rate by which people access it. The reason why we draw a line under that is that there is now an anticipation amongst a large number of Australians that that is the price that they will pay for health care via the private funds. We are not in the business of undermining that. What were are in the business of doing is not undermining private health cover, but advancing public health support. Those are the sorts of things that we've been talking about here today.

 JOURNALIST: An advertisement in The Age today … did you see that ad? What's your …

 BEAZLEY: Yes, I have. I've seen the ad. It tells a tragic and terrible story - a sad, tragic and terrible story. Beyond what is in the advertisement, I don't know anything about it. And it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment directly, therefore, on what is the sad circumstances that are portrayed

 there. I understand it's the subject of a coronial inquiry, or coronial investigation as well. So, even more so, it would be inappropriate for me to directly comment on that.

 But is appropriate for me to comment on aged care and to point out that the Liberals are now in complete confusion on this. John Howard starts out firstly and says there's no crisis. Then he releases an aged care policy which he says will spend an extra $300 to $400 million. Then Treasury comes back and says, 'no, you're not spending anything extra'. And then Bronwyn comes out and says, 'we haven't put our policy in yet in relation to aged care'. All that they are producing is confusion. What are producing is solutions. There absolutely has to be support for our aged care industry. First, to ensure that they have the funds to be able to build the nursing homes, or alter the nursing homes to take the phantom beds which are now part of that 12,000 short-fall. Secondly, we have to make sure that they get assistance in providing quality care. Included in that are proper resources for paying nurses the right amount and making sure that they get access, too, to assistance for their nurses with a decent program of aged carers. That is what we are doing. We think there is a crisis and we are going to address it. I'm sadden by that advertisement, but, as I say, it would not be appropriate for me to directly comment on it.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, you say that you've got to rely on economic assumptions … forecast … signs are … international economy are more ominous by the day. To what extent would you … flexible in office about your policies …

 BEAZLEY: You ask a whole series of hypothetical questions there, which in day 31 of an election campaign no politician would possibly contemplate for one minute answering. That's the first thing. The second thing I'd say, however, we have been cautious in the way in which we have done policy. I suppose that explains the extraordinary tooing and froing of our political opponents in trying to criticise us. On the one hand they say you're spending too much. On the other hand, they say you spending not enough. The fact of the matter is that the spending proposals we've put forward we've carefully calibrated to the economic circumstances we see and the budgetary circumstances we see. We are doing that in anticipation we'll sustain surpluses. We assume that the Treasury has seen, as all the rest of us, the international economic climate and are making calculations on the basis of that. They've probably also been looking at the pump priming measures being put in place by the United States and most European governments and are making calculations of the longevity of international economic difficulties on the basis of those pump priming measures. As far as we are concerned, our policies hold good. Our policies are complete. Our policies in this election campaign are unique. Our political opponents are not following us down the road of providing solutions to Australian problems. We are not deterred by that. We will press on.

 JOURNALIST: Given those economic threats, another … seen in this campaign and, in fact, federal politics for the last couple of years, has been this need to keep the Budget in surplus. Is there any reason, or is there any justification do you think for a fiscal stimulus that runs the Budget into deficit? There are business people, there are economists who say that deficit isn't bad …

 BEAZLEY: The good thing about what I'm doing here today is not giving you a lecture on economics. What I'm doing here is putting forward our proposals in the light of the circumstances that are presented to us. We persist with those circumstances. I am not intending to return to academia any time soon, in which case I might have been prepared to give you a lecture on that particular subject. What I intend to do is to look at the circumstances we've been presented with. We've been presented with a picture of growth in this country, albeit coming off a shattering of that growth by the impact of the goods and

 services tax on the economy. But that process steadily washing its way through so at least some growth is beginning to come back now. What does that picture for the future? Well, what it pictures is a position which does permit us, provided we make a few savings on the way through, and we've announced those, does permit us to offer reasonable propositions to our colleagues in the States to deal with public education and health issues and a range of other matters including aged. We are confident that we are going to be able to deliver on all we say we will. If we fail, unlike Mr Howard, I'll be back there to answer for it in three years time. My opponent, if Mr Howard is defeated, will, of course be Peter Costello, if it's the Labor Party in Opposition opposing our opponents, it will be Peter Costello also. Because he intends to be there.

 JOURNALIST: … is Saturday the last chance for Australians … GST. And, on that, if Labor loses the election, would promises to rollback the GST never ever come before the Australian people?

 BEAZLEY: This election on Saturday gives a choice, a fundamental choice to the Australian people to go in one of two directions. On the Government's side, if they are re-elected, they will put the GST on food and they'll put pressure on to raise the rate. They will do that. They have said that that is their commitment. They have said it repeatedly. On the other hand, the Labor Party will make it simpler and fairer. It's a very simple choice between those positions. And they are poles apart - going further apart in this election campaign. If on Saturday the Labor Party is elected, the goods and services tax will be made simpler and fairer, taking it off items that are essential to families - like electricity and gas. If the Liberals are elected, as night follows day, no matter what their never ever promises are, it will be on food and the rate will rise.
