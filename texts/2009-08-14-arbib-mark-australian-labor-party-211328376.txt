 Government funding to match jobseekers with jobs 

 Six organisations will share in almost $700,000 funding under round one of the Rudd  Government’s $6 million Employer Broker program, Minister for Employment Participation,  Senator Mark Arbib, announced today. 

 Senator Arbib said Employer Brokers will work with employment services to focuss on  matching the needs of job seekers with the needs of employers.   

 “The objective of this program is for Employer Brokers to work with employers in locations  experiencing skill or labour shortages and develop solutions to meet employers’ needs,”  Senator Arbib said. 

 “Australia is currently experiencing uncertain economic times, however, at the same time  many industries continue to face shortages of appropriately skilled labour. 

 “The challenge is how to match job seekers with those areas of demand, now and in the  future. 

 “We want to be in the best position possible for when the economy recovers. 

 “This program will help disadvantaged job seekers, Indigenous Australians and migrants, to  gain skills which will help them obtain sustainable employment.”  

 Senator Arbib praised the creativity of proposed activities and their ability to meet the  objectives of the program.  

 “Many of the proposals pooled a range of services, including providing job seekers with  mentoring, training and work experience specifically targeted to the needs of local  employers,” Senator Arbib said. 

 Successful round one projects are: 

 â¢ Queensland Rural Industry Training Council’s Building People for Building  Jobs: Accredited construction training tailored to the needs of the job seeker. These  job seekers will be linked to employers in the construction industry in Logan in  Queensland.  

 â¢ Real Corporate Partners’ Connecting Displaced Workers with Jobs in the  Logistics Industry: Training, on-site work experience and industry education will be  provided to attract displaced workers to logistic and warehousing positions in the  Orange region of NSW.  

 â¢ Queensland Rural Industry Training Council’s Moving Farmhands into Moving  Machinery: Training for the long-term unemployed, youth and Indigenous  Australians to address the acute shortage of skilled farmhands in Queensland. Job  seekers will undertake training to allow them to obtain an operator’s ticket in at least  three types of farm machinery. Tailored pre-employment training, including language,  literacy and numeracy, will also be provided.  

 â¢ Limestone Coast Regional Development Board’s Clean Jobs: Support for  employers and job seekers to gain the skills and knowledge to develop sustainable  agricultural practices. This will focus on dairying, viticulture and broad acre farming  in South Australia. This project will simultaneously assist farmers to meet their skills  needs and develop and implement environmental management systems.  

 â¢ ACCES Services’ Rural Employment Assistance Program (REAP) for migrants  and refugees: Relocating newly arrived migrants and refugees from high  unemployment areas to Biloela, in Queensland, where employers have identified  labour and skills shortages. Relocation assistance and accredited training will assist  job seekers to find employment in the community care, agriculture and meat and  livestock industries.  

 â¢ Eastern Access Community Health’s Employment in Aged Care sector for  jobseekers with a disability: Accredited and on-the-job training and support for job  seekers with disability to take up positions in the community care sector in  Melbourne.  

 The Government has allocated $6 million over three years to fund Employer Broker  activities.
