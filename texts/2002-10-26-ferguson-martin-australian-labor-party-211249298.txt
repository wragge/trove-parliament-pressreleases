 MARTIN FERGUSON MP

 Shadow Minister for Regional and Urban Development, Transport, Infrastructure and Tourism

 Address to the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria 2002 State Conference

 “Victoria: The Multicultural Challenge”

 Ballarat

 26th October 2002

 Check Against Delivery

 Embargoed until 7.30pm Saturday 26th October 2002

 Thank you for the opportunity to speak to your Annual Conference and congratulations for conducting it in the regional centre of Ballarat.

 This area epitomises the themes of your conference. There is a multicultural challenge in Victoria, indeed across the whole of regional Australia.

 Ballarat is home to people from 16 different nationalities which is very encouraging

 But Ballarat is also an area that has significant potential for further development of a vibrant, inclusive multicultural community that is a leading light in sustainable regional development.

 Our country has been enriched by its migrant population and the migrant population has been enriched by what Australia has to offer them.

 But our migrant communities are not getting the benefits of all we have to offer.

 Historically, migrants did settle in our regions, forming successful community partnerships that are still evident in areas such as Cooma and Mildura.

 Today, however, new migrants are not experiencing the Australian way of life outside our major cities.

 Australia is one of the most urbanised nations in the world and trends suggest there is no abatement of this urbanisation.

 The population growth outside of our metropolitan cities has been concentrated on the fringe areas of major cities.

 Statistics tell us that Australia’s migrant population continues to cling even more tightly to the capital cities.

 As we all know, there are many reasons for this continuing trend.

 2

 They’ll be closer to family that have already settled here, perhaps they have already developed contact networks in these cities or they have knowledge of the migrant support networks established.

 In my view, another factor is that community support for migrants is virtually non-existent outside these cities.

 It is readily argued that because migrant settlement outside the major cities is low, support services reflect this.

 But is also argued that there is no provision for migrant services outside the capital cities, hence no migrant settlement.

 It is my belief that the latter must be addressed to circumvent the former.

 Out of the twelve Migrant Resource Centres operating in Victoria, just two are located outside the Melbourne Metropolitan area - Geelong and Gippsland.

 I am not arguing that MRC’s should be established in every country town across the country - that’s simply not a viable option.

 What I do argue is that the services MRC’s offer to migrants are vital to their integration into our communities.

 It is essential that migrants have access to health services, English language lessons, orientation services, interpreting and translating services, job network information, training assistance social services, referral services and access to advice.

 It is essential that we employ flexible support programs that ensure such services are available where they are needed, whether that’s in the capital cities or the regions.

 We need to encourage local government organisations, non-profit organisations, educational institutions or community groups to establish formal or informal support networks that work in conjunction with government agencies.

 That said it is not the case that by simply giving migrant’s access to these services that we will reverse the current trend towards city dwelling.

 Labor believes that the debate surrounding migration cannot be considered in alienation from the broader population debate.

 A larger population will culturally enrich Australia, assist us to achieve economic objectives, help build our regions, and help us to meet new challenges as our population ages.

 But population policy is broader than immigration alone - it also involves measures in health, aged care, fertility, national development and sustainability.

 Labor has led the debate for a coordinated population policy effort by the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments.

 The current Federal Government, however, has maintained a “one size fits all” approach to its population and migration programs.

 While it is true that there is a range of migration programs in operation, they are patchy and piecemeal at best.

 It is also true that a regional migration program is in place, but the success of the scheme, as it currently operates, leaves a lot to be desired.

 Department of Immigration figures show just 3,850 of some 92,000 migrants to Australia in 2000-01 did so under this regional migration program.

 This certainly cannot be claimed as a success.

 A further concern is the current pattern of settlement of refugees and migrants into areas of high unemployment and few services.

 I put it to you that there is a need to acknowledge the mutual benefits of migration programs.

 The needs of migrants and the needs of existing communities must be at the heart of migration programs.

 Regions suffering labour shortages need to be attractive to skilled migrants.

 Regions suffering from high unemployment may benefit from increased levels of business migration.

 Communities need to understand what challenges they face and how those challenges can be addressed.

 Communities also need a sense of direction and the ability to work together to achieve their goals.

 I also put it too you that the communities themselves must be ready to embrace a new culture. They must be open to new ideas, new customs, different family structures, different foods, different dress and different religion.

 But diversity should not be seen in a negative light.

 Diversity must be seen as having a positive influence on community building and a legitimate conduit to regional development.

 The capacity to ensure regional sustainability relies on a commitment by all tiers of government to regional development.

 4

 It also relies on a concerted, whole of government approach to addressing regional needs.

 My challenge to you and to Government is to recognise that we must extend our thinking to create new social and economic opportunities in regional Australia.

 If our regions are going to be able to support migration, it is vital that this agenda is linked with the broader regional development agenda.

 Infrastructure development on roads, railways, water provision, energy, housing, schools, hospitals, telecommunications and the like continue to be desperately needed in regional Australia.

 The Howard Government has failed to recognise the economic and social imperatives behind the need for infrastructure investment, particularly in regional communities.

 I argue that this is also an impediment to encouraging migrants settling outside our capital cities.  

 Infrastructure spending has a positive impact on local and regional economies with many direct and indirect benefits.

 Migrant settlement should be one.

 Infrastructure development must involve integration within our transport system, our economy, our lifestyles and our built and natural environment.

 A healthy, sustainable environment will improve living standards, create jobs, support regional development and encourage growth of sustainable industries.

 But I take this opportunity to point out to you that as progress has been made in improving our quality of life, the state of the environment has suffered.

 Regional development initiatives must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.

 Movement towards environmentally sustainable industry development must be grasped by our regions with both hands.

 With vision and leadership, we do not have to choose between decent environmental outcomes and a strong, growing regional economy.

 We can have both.

 Many regions across Australia are in decline.

 5

 Our regions are losing people, especially young adults, who are heading for our capital cities.

 Along with this loss of population goes loss of economic activity, diversity and, as a result, services.

 These regions are becoming unsustainable.

 It is time this problem was recognised and that we must reverse the trend and promote regional sustainability.

 By this I mean that the focus must be on generating activity in the regions that will support its economy and population, not turn it away.

 Such activity will ensure the provision of services that support the region and enable successful networks, partnerships and other community building social structures. This activity must also attract people, including migrants, to the regions.

 Governments have a clear role to play in bringing this about.

 Governments must support regions in their endeavours to generate new and diverse activity and to create new opportunities and jobs.

 And it is also a perfect platform for encouraging and inviting migrants to settle there.

 Together these people will strengthen the community.

 They will need houses, they will shop, they will buy cars, they will socialise, and they will bring new ideas and help invigorate the local community.

 This is where I see a significant cultural benefit emerging for Australia as a whole.

 Through the concentration of migration to our capital cities we have seen the development of a rich and colourful multicultural facet to the Australian way of life.

 The emergence of a society that embraces tolerance and inclusiveness has resulted.

 These important social attributes also have a place in regional and rural communities.

 These communities will, as an extremely positive by-product of migration, gain the opportunity to embrace the multiculturalism that is so evident in our major cities.

 However, the task will not be easy.

 6

 Addressing the customary behaviour of migration to our capital cities needs concentrated effort and support from the ground up.

 I am confident that we can make inroads in achieving increased migration to our regions.

 I am confident we can meet the challenges you have identified as the theme of this conference.

 And I’m confident that the result will be a reinvigorated regional Australia, rich with the hallmark multiculturalism so many Australians already enjoy.

 Thankyou.
