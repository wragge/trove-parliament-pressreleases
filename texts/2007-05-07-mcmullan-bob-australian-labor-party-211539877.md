 FEDERAL LABOR SAYS DETENTION CENTRES  ARE NOT GENUINE AID   

 Federal  Labor  has  called  on  the  Howard  Government  to  explain  why  it  gives   priority  to  the  funding  of  detention  centres  on  Nauru  and  Manus  Island  in  the   overseas aid budget.   

 And  it  also  called  for  a  new  direction  in  overseas  aid  and  focus  on  the  South   Pacific  taking  into  account  the  emergency  of  “climate  change  refugees”  from   struggling atolls affected by increased ocean levels.   

 By  any  commonsense  reading,  overseas  aid  is  about  clean  drinking  water  and   sanitation, community development and poverty reduction, it should not be about  detention centres.   

 In February, Labor put questions to the Howard Government about other dubious  aid spending at the Senate Estimates.    

 Although  responses  are  now  more  than  30  days  overdue,  the  Government  has   still not provided answers to these questions.   

 In previous years, the Howard Government has used the aid budget as a Whole-of-Government ATM, withdrawing large sums to fund a variety of activities - few  of them resembling genuine development assistance to the poorest countries in  our region.   

 The focus of the aid program should be on poverty reduction and achieving the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Instead,  the  Howard  Government  has  dipped   time and again into the aid budget to fund activities such as: 

 â¢ Debt relief to Iraq: $644 million to date; and 

 â¢ Detention  Centres  on  Nauru  and  Manus  Island:  $247  million  since   financial year 2000-01   

 This raises real concerns about the effectiveness of our aid spending.    

 We expect to see Mr Howard’s announced doubling of the 2004 aid expenditure  by 2010, reflected in the forward estimates of the aid budget. This should amount  to a significant increase to funds available to assist our neighbours to meet the  Millennium Development Goals.    

 For  example,  the  World  Vision  report  released  today  indicates  that  proven  cost   effective  health  programs  funded  by  Australia  could  reduce  the  number  of   children dying in our region by at least 100,000 per year. As well as supporting  more  effective  health  systems,  there  needs  to  be  a  greater  focus  on  improving   child and maternal health.    

 

 The aid program must also address the impact of climate change in the Pacific,  and our other neighbouring countries. Through the aid program, the Government  should  work  with  partner  countries  to  develop  country  and  regional  adaptation   plans to climate change. 

 

 In addition, we will also be seeking the following in this year’s aid budget: 

 â¢ An increase in education with a focus on primary education and up-skilling  in-country (not just scholarships for students to be skilled off-shore); 

 â¢ Increased  spending  on  infrastructure,  particularly  in  the  Mekong  region   and  with  a  focus  on  essential  services  such  as  water,  sanitation  and   electricity to people living in poverty; 

 â¢ Increased  contributions  to  NGOs.  Currently,  NGOs  receive  only  4.4%  of   the  aid  budget.  Australian’s  make  it  clear  through  their  private   contributions that they regard NGOs as an effective and trusted source of  development  assistance  and  the  Government  should  give  this  sector   higher priority.
