 Joint Media Release with:

 The Australian Government is providing $11 million to charitable and non-profit organisations to  enable them to continue to deliver valuable community services to the disadvantaged during the  economic downturn. 

 Last week, a report commissioned by the Government and undertaken by the Centre for Corporate  Public Affairs - Impact of the economic downturn on not-for-profit organisation management -  revealed that more Australians under financial pressure are turning to community organisations for  help. 

 At the same time, these organisations are experiencing a reduction in investment income, corporate  funding and support from philanthropic trusts and foundations. 

 The Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and  Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin and Parliamentary Secretary for the Voluntary Sector, Ursula  Stephens, today announced Temporary Financial Assistance grants to 37 organisations through the  Australian Government’s Jobs Fund. 

 The Jobs Fund is a $650 million Australian Government initiative to support, create or retain jobs and  increase skills through innovative projects that build community infrastructure and increase social  capital in local communities across the country. 

 Temporary Financial Assistance grants are provided under the Get Communities Working stream of  the Jobs Fund. It will support charitable and non-profit organisations that have experienced a  decrease in donations in the current economic downturn.    

 The funding from the Temporary Financial Assistance grants will assist a variety of organisations  including: 

 â¢ The Australian Red Cross whose nationâwide work assists people with mental illness.   â¢ Cystic Fibrosis Queensland which provides vital services to people with cystic fibrosis.   â¢ Jesuit Social Services which runs the Abbotsford Biscuits Kitchen, providing employment for  disadvantaged young people.
