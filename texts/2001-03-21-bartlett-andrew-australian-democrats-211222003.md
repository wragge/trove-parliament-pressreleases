 Irony of divisive Minister urging ‘harmony’ Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock could best promote the ‘harmony’ campaign by ceasing his divisive attacks on boat people and properly funding settlement services for refugees, according to the Australian Democrats.

 Responding to Minister Ruddock’s address to the National Press Club today, Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson said:

 “The ‘Harmony’ campaign does not replace a commitment to multiculturalism.

 “Posters and dance displays do not replace English classes and financial support for new refugees.”

 “If the immigration program is nothing more than a recruitment program for wealthy, well-educated business people then we will lose the important role of the humanitarian and family reunion program.

 “The Minister has shown a willingness to arouse fear and hostility towards boat people.

 He has treated unauthorised arrivals as if they were an invading force, locking them up for long periods of time, denying them legal advice and generally treating them like the enemy.

 “The Labor Party is willing to make mileage out of recent allegations of mistreatment and abuse but the detention policy was introduced by the ALP when they were in Government.

 “The Democrats have always argued that mandatory detention for all unauthorised arrivals is unnecessarily harsh.

 It is time for all political parties to reassess their attitude to this inhumane and unnecessary practice," concluded Senator Bartlett.
