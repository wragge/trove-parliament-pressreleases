 Media release   Stephen Smith MP Minister for Foreign Affairs  Senator Chris Evans Leader of the Government in the Senate Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Bob Debus MP Minister for Home Affairs                               14 April 2009   Regional cooperation to strengthen borders   A senior delegation of Australian ministers will today join their Government counterparts from more than 40 countries for a two-day international meeting in Indonesia to further strengthen regional efforts to combat people smuggling, human trafficking and transnational crime.  Foreign Minister Stephen Smith will co-chair the Bali Process Ministerial meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr Hassan Wirajuda. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, heads the Australian delegation, which also includes Home Affairs Minister Bob Debus.  Mr Smith said the Conference would bring together ministers from source, transit and destination countries as well as key international organisations, such as the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  “The Australian Government is highly supportive of the Bali Process, which was established by Australia and Indonesia to develop practical measures to help combat people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crimes in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond,” Mr Smith said.  The ministers’ agenda will include a discussion on regional solutions to current and emerging challenges on people smuggling and trafficking.  Senator Evans said the Bali Process has been successful in creating a cooperative environment in which Governments can work together at both the political and operational level to prevent and intercept people smuggling and trafficking activities.  “Recent boat arrivals to Australia and other countries in our region demonstrate that we are not immune from the conflict and insecurity that drives irregular movement. People smugglers remain active and willing to exploit the displaced and vulnerable,” Senator Evans said.  “Australia will continue to work with our partners to improve further border security and migration management while at the same time ensuring appropriate support for displaced populations and resolution of protracted humanitarian situations.”  Home Affairs Minister Bob Debus said transnational criminal organisations continued to profit from the smuggling and trafficking of human beings, with disregard to the safety or human rights of those being smuggled and trafficked.

 “This forum is an excellent opportunity to recognise and build on the regional efforts undertaken to  date to detect and deter the activities of criminal networks engaged in people smuggling and human  trafficking,” Mr Debus said.   

 The ministers said the development of close working relationships with other countries is part of the  Australian Government’s comprehensive approach to border and migration management.
