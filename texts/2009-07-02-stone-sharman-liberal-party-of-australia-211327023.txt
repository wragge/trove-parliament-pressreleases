 Evans celebrates minimum sentence for people smugglers 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The giving of minimum sentences to those charged with people smuggling through the magistrates courts 

 announced yesterday is not the great outcome as claimed by Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator 

 Chris Evans.  

 “This Government should be aiming to deliver a strong message that Australia will not tolerate people smuggling 

 or people trafficking,” Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said.  

 “Prime Minister Rudd described people smugglers as the “vilest form of humanity", however that message is 

 blurred if minimum sentences are delivered and Senator Evans celebrates the fact.  

 “When you have profits of over $1 million per unauthorised boat arriving and being escorted to Christmas Island, 

 a $200,000 maximum fine does not constitute a serious deterrent.”  

 “While Christmas Island Detention Centre is now reaching full capacity with over 700 detainees on the island, we 

 need to do more than simply line the ambulances up at the bottom of the cliff.” Sharman Stone said.  

 “The Rudd Government must urgently address the consequences of their unraveling of migration policy designed 

 to ensure those most in need are offered Australian permanent protection.  

 “Publicly celebrating a minimum sentence given to smugglers participating in this inhuman trade is not a 

 message which is consistent with Prime Minister Rudd‘s statement about the criminality and heinous behavior of 

 the smugglers who are sending people into Australia Waters in unseaworthy vessels,” Sharman Stone said.
