 MEDIA RELEASE

 Greens call for inquiry into refugee  child’s attempted suicide   

 The Greens have written to the Minister for Immigration requesting that a public  Parliamentary Inquiry be established to look into a refugee child’s attempted suicide on  Christmas Island.   

 “There needs to be a full and frank public investigation into this child’s attempted  suicide,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “We need to know more about the care he was offered before the tragic event and what  took place afterwards.   

 “There are reports of a significant delay between the attempted suicide and the boy’s  evacuation to appropriate healthcare facilities in Perth. This needs to be investigated.   

 “I have also asked the Minister to guarantee that this child won’t be sent back to  Christmas Island and won’t be sent offshore to Nauru or Manus Island.   

 “This boy is here alone. He deserves our care and love, not more cruelty.   

 “The government’s talked about its hard-line asylum seeker policy a lot over the last few  weeks as Election Day looms.   

 “Children are languishing on Nauru, families are being separated in Australia and a child  has attempted suicide on Christmas Island. This is the cruel face of the government’s  hard-line asylum seeker policy.   

 “We need a legal and humane way forward, not more cruelty.”
