 Democrats praise Budget's Refugee & Migration measures  Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett has praised the Budget measures to expand our migration and  humanitarian programs and to confirm Labor's promise to abolish the harsh and ineffective  Temporary Protection Visa.    

 "The nation building role that migration plays is often overlooked in political debate, but it is more  crucial than ever at this time, given some of the major economic pressures Australia currently  faces," Senator Bartlett says.   

 "The increase in the family and humanitarian intakes, alongside more permanent places for skilled  migrants makes the migration program more balanced."   

 "However, there still needs to be more settlement support provided to all new arrivals."   

 Senator Bartlett gave special praise to the scrapping of Temporary Protection Visas.   

 "It should never be forgotten that Labor supported John Howard to introduce this visa, which  history has proved to have been cruel, counter-productive and ineffective, as the Democrats  warned it would be when we attempted to stop its passage through the Senate in November 1999.   

 

 "It was specifically designed to inflict hardship on genuine refugees and keep families separated."   

 "But equally, Labor's willingness to scrap the visa should be praised."   

 "It will enable many current and future refugees to be able to fully contribute to the Australian  community and economy, as so many have done in the past to the great benefit of our nation."
