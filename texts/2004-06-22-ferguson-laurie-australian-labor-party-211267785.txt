 LAURIE FERGUSON MP        SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR REID  22 June 2005 

 

 INDEFINITE DETENTION VS HUMANE  PROCESSING:  GOVERNMENT DEFEATS LABOR’S  AMENDMENTS   

 Today the Howard Government refused to support Labor’s attempts to remove  ALL children and their families from behind the razor wire, and four other  proposals aimed at implementing a humane, rather than punitive immigration  system. 

 

 History repeats itself, as the Government has yet again lost the opportunity for  adequate reform. Back in 2002, and 2003, Labor moved amendments aimed at  removing children and their families from detention. The Government disallowed  Labor’s attempts at substantive reform then, as it did today.”   

 I reiterate my comments when I moved the amendments today, that the  Government’s changes to the Migration Act are “inadequate” and “an insult to the  exposures that have occurred over recent months”, especially in light of  Howard’s admission that indefinite detention will not cease.   

 Whilst the Government’s changes promise to speed up processing, there is a  lack of certainty for TPV holders, and there’s a 2 year incarceration criteria before  cases come under review. In addition, an incompetent Minister is given even  more power. Sufficient reform entails “transparency; more accountability; and the  reduced possibility of wrongful detention.”   

 Accordingly, Labor moved amendments which would ensure a faster, fairer,  humane and transparent detention system. These included:   

 â¢ Removing ALL children from behind the razor wire;  â¢ Establishing an independent inspector-general of detention centres to  monitor conditions and resolve complaints;  â¢ Requiring the Ombudsman to report on people detained for more than 90 

 days, and on a monthly basis thereafter;  â¢ Guaranteeing Independent medical and media access to detention  centres; and 

 â¢ Giving certainty to TPV holders   

 It’s disgraceful that Labor’s efforts in seeking a humane and just detention  system have been swept under the carpet by the Howard Government.
