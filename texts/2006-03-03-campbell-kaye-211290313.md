    Class and John Howard’s Liberalism 

  

  

      There is a relationship between belonging to a political party (the Liberal Party) 

  and a person’s (John Howard’s) position within a so ciety as a member of a social 

  class. Belonging and membership are important features in the formation of personal 

  identity and public persona. Belonging to a politic al party is to have allegiance with a 

  tradition that has developed, from Australia’s fede ration onwards, through the activity 

  of parliamentary debate and political activism. The  political activity of running a 

  Government is an active and dynamic process. It is expected that politicians’ strategic 

  manoeuvres and the statements given to explain thei r actions will necessarily reflect 

  the dynamism of political expediency.  

      Political policies develop over time but are pu t into practice in the relatively shorter 

  term when one party holds the political majority. T here is an element of serendipity in 

  how local, state and world events unfold and impact  on political parties’ policies. 

  Four unfolding events and policies that were enacte d during John Howard’s terms as 

  Prime Minister of Australia have been selected to b e discussed. The four include: 

  legislation on guns, detention of asylum seekers, s upport for the war and occupation 

  of Iraq, and ‘Gallipoli nationalism’.  

      A political party (or alliance of parties) that  hold the majority of seats not only 

  contributes to success in forming and implementing policies but also in adding to the 

  tradition as a party with leadership qualities. Thi s leadership quality of a party is 

  usually personified in the person of the Prime Mini ster. 1 When referring to John 

  Howard I am invoking the personification of the lea dership of a political party rather 

  than the personal qualities of the man. Mungo MacCallum has attributed ‘best 

  politician’ to John Howard based on the criteria of  success. 2 Success comes in several 

  guises, including that of personal gain, strategic manoeuvre and public achievement.   

  

      Human identity is forged in social relationship s. To feel belonging to and have 

  membership of social associations can be seen as es sential to personal identity. These 

  relationships of association play out in a society and one way to distinguish groups 

  within a society is to determine their social class . Class is dealt with here as an 

  abbreviation of ‘social class’ and refers to the gr oupings that occur in society through 

  distinctions like, for example, the subcultural dif ferences in a society, the social 

  ranking of persons based on the power relations wit hin a society, and the group a 

  person is born into or seen to belong to through bi rth or their education, self-application and wealth, or lack of. Class also infe rs a distinction of some sort, social 

  refinement, or lack of. There has been some debate over whether the stratification of 

  society into classes is relevant to today’s Austral ians. 3 However, I do not want to be 

  drawn into an ideological based argument on the rel evance of social class. Instead, I 

  have chosen to discuss ‘belonging’ and ‘membership’ which may be interpreted 

  further through the attribution of social class. Th is discussion relies on a specific 

  understanding of the two notions of ‘belonging’ and  ‘membership’.  

      ‘Belonging’ is distinguished by the subjectivit y of the notion: it refers to the feeling 

  that arises when there is self-identification throu gh a bond of relationship with a 

  group. ‘Belonging’ includes our sense of duty to ot hers, but it is of the type that wells 

  up within and translates into heartfelt actions whi ch can negate in an instant an 

  alternative isolationist or self-preservationist ra tionale. The desire for self-preservation may just as quickly take precedence an d be rationalized as a preferable 

  state, but not without a sense of having lost somet hing which was of value (be it 

  momentary). ‘Membership’ is understood to be the more formal and public 

  representation of belonging. The duties that follow  from membership come in the 

  form of obligations. Formalized membership requires there to be guidelines for 

  behaviour and restrictions to the freedom to act as  an individual; the individual has the 

  choice to interpret the grounds of social membershi p and to comply, or not; and the 

  risk is that the latter may pass as social non-conf ormity at one extreme, or result in the 

  loss of citizen status at the other.  

      ‘Belonging’ and ‘membership’ can align as the f ormalization of our belonging, but 

  there can be a rift, or tear, between ‘belonging’ a nd ‘membership’. A citizen can be 

  Australian by membership conferred through birth or  naturalization, but to belong to a 

  nation requires depth of association through a shar ed history with the potential for 

  newcomers to become integral to its ongoing history . The history of the indigenous 

  people of Australia is a striking example of a peop le with a strong sense of belonging 

  to culture and territory, yet those who claimed the ir territory as belonging (in the 

  sense of ownership) to the Australian nation restri cted their membership. Belonging to 

  a social group is broader in meaning than mere membership, it includes the 

  sustenance and nurturance of citizens and all that entails.  

      The expression of belonging has character infor ming aspects; I believe this may 

  come through the expectation that individuals who f eel belonging can identify with 

  others outside of an immediate self-concern. The ab ility to feel belonging with others 

  can extend to transnational associations with other s. It is very suspect if the belonging 

  felt by being a part of a sustaining association re lies only on the promotion of fear and 

  exclusionary practices that relate to those viewed as outsiders. The belonging I refer 

  to is that which puts us in touch with our common h umanity and the difficulty in 

  trying to be humane in response to fearful situatio ns or when meeting the need for 

  protective measures.    

  

      The layout of what follows presents the selecte d four unfolding events with the 

  intention to describe these events and what can be implied from the actions taken by 

  the Howard Government in relation to the notions of  belonging and membership. 

  There is also a comment on leadership, but that com ponent is part of a larger 

  enterprise than can be presented in a seminar. 

  

  1. Legislation on Guns  

      Event â The concern over citizens use of guns a nd violence had been brought into 

  federal government prior to John Howard’s first ele ction as Prime Minister in March 

  1996. Some measures of gun control â the registrati on for gun owners in the States 

  and Commonwealth control over their importation â were already in place. The 

  previous Labour federal government and the States h ad been party to discussions that 

  led to the initiation of a National Committee on Vi olence that met in October 1988 to 

  make recommendations which included restrictive gun control. The event which 

  brought all this work to the forefront (as somethin g to be implemented) was the action 

  of one gunman responsible for killing 35 persons an d injuring 19 others in one 

  incident at Port Arthur in Tasmania in April 1996. The response by the new Howard 

  leadership, in concert with the States and Territor ies, was to bring about restrictive 

  gun control and a gun buyback scheme which ran from late 1996 to 1998.  

      Belonging â The event was a very emotive and tr agic one for many Australians. 

  The deliberate brutality and the threat this event presented had implications to any 

  citizen moving about in public places. Their belong ing was expressed through an 

  empathy with the victims families and an understand ing that such an event could 

  occur to any person in the vicinity of a person wit h a gun and an intention to kill.   

      Membership â Unlike the United States model for  democracy, the membership of 

  Australian society did not include a similar nation al understanding of the individual’s 

  right to own and use guns. Guns in the hands of ind ividuals is for legitimate activities 

  and the ownership of guns for personal protection w as likely to be tainted by the idea 

  of possible offensive or defensive criminal activit y.  

      Leadership â There was an assertive response by  the Howard government to bring 

  about a national policy that restricted gun ownersh ip, a policy supported by federal 

  funds to compensate the owners of guns who were affected.    

  

  2. Detention of Asylum Seekers 

      Event â The detention of asylum seekers was a p olicy adopted prior to John 

  Howard taking office as Prime Minister. Thus the un folding event was the situation of 

  how to deal with those in detention and the thinkin g behind maintaining the 

  incarceration of these people. What seemingly began  as detaining people until the 

  legitimacy of their claims for refugee status was e stablished, became the detention of 

  people for indefinite periods in specially built ca mps. The treatment of refugees was 

  criticized by the United Nations and by some Austra lians, but the popular attitude of 

  Australians was to regard these people as illegal i mmigrants who should be returned 

  to their country of origin or repulsed from entry i nto Australia. The strategies engaged 

  by the Howard government included their physical segregation from Australian 

  society in isolated camps and offshore on islands o f agreeable nations, with the result 

  that their rights, which would be accorded to a cit izen of a country, were not fully 

  recognized and the covenant between nations for the  treatment of refugees blatantly 

  attempted to be circumvented.      

      Belonging â This demonstrates that there is a p olicy that recognizes the rights of 

  Australians to be selective over who has the right to enter, stay and apply for 

  residential status. How the policies to deal with a sylum seekers played out infers that 

  the right to be selectively Australian is to be pro tected and has precedence over 

  traditions of refuge and hospitality given by one c ountry to people of another country. 

  This nationalistic type of belonging restricts tran snational feeling which is necessary 

  to consider the overall humanity or inhumanity of n ational policies.        

      Membership â The way the actions of the government played out infers that to be 

  Australian is an exclusive membership, one that acc ords rights and benefits that are 

  not reflected in the manner in which those stranded  outside their national borders are 

  to be treated. It is as if this is a nation bereft of hospitality unless, of course, this 

  specifically refers to the dollars accrued by the t ourism industry.     

      Leadership â The relentless manner which this i solationist policy was played out 

  and the time that it has taken to resolve it brings  into question that there should have 

  been a better policy, that is, to determine the ter ms of hospitality for refugees rather 

  than a determination to achieve their incarceration  and expulsion. The leadership was 

  strong in implementing a policy but this strength w as shown to be a determined 

  strength to achieve a successful result and the unf olding events included revelations of 

  just how such determination can include a tolerance  for the dissemination of incorrect 

  information, namely, the children overboard scandal .   

  

  3. Support for the War and Occupation of Iraq 

      Event â The early 21 st  century rhetoric of the ‘war on terror’ originated  from the 

  speeches of United States of America’s president Ge orge Bush. This strongly worded 

  rhetoric was to be translated into an actual war be tween nations (the 2003 Iraq War) 

  initiated by United States of America’s government under Bush’s leadership. 

  Concomitant with the acceptance of the rhetoric on how to deal effectively with 

  terrorism came the means to address terrorism’s thr eat through legislative changes to 

  how their nationals and non-nationals are to be tre ated in law. 4  The Australian 

  government under John Howard’s leadership took up the rhetoric, promoted the 

  legitimacy of the Iraq War and supported the war in  and occupation of Iraq. This 

  government also followed through with legislative c hanges to address the threat of 

  terrorism. The tendency of Australia is to have rel ations of fealty 5 (to nations with 

  stronger military and economic power) when participating in international events of 

  political import; first to Britain as colonizer of territory, and later to the United States 

  of America as an economic culture that colonizes.   

      Belonging â The belonging promoted here is a re cognition of nationalistic 

  belonging between nations with shared ideals rather  than transnational belonging. The 

  belonging is to a nation identified as democratic a nd free. These concepts can be 

  identified as important in order to feel capable of  belonging. However, one need not 

  feel democratic and free in order to feel belonging , for belonging often impinges on 

  the individual’s right to have a say in what occurs  and the choices which are to be 

  made.  

      Membership â Australians can be made to feel th ey are members of the group of 

  Western democratic nations. However, fealty does not give group membership to 

  another nation’s set of rights unless there are for mal and symbolic structures in place 

  to cement the membership. What are the formal structures in place between Australia 

  and the Unites States?      

      Leadership â The model for policies and actions  appeared to be based on the 

  rhetoric and decisions of the United States of Amer ica.   

  

  4. Promotion of ‘Gallipoli Nationalism’  

      Event â Australians commemorate a national day of remembrance for those killed 

  in a battle fought in 1915. This battle is part of the history of those Australians who 

  were related to the original Anzacs, part of the hi story of all Australians as an 

  international event in which its citizens played an  active part, and a character 

  informing cornerstone to the tradition of active mi litary service and Australians’ 

  relationship with other nations. Anzac Day, as a da y of remembrance, includes rituals 

  that acknowledge grief and compassion for the event  at Gallipoli, and this expression 

  of sentiment for those unfortunate combatants bring s powerfully to mind the situation 

  of those fortunate Australians who have not had to serve their nation as soldiers but 

  who are the beneficiaries of their legacy. ‘Gallipo li nationalism’ refers to type of 

  memorial for those killed in battle that unites the  feelings of generations into a ritual 

  of national identification. This I propose is somew hat different to a national identity 

  that one relates to as typifying the Australian cha racter or mythologizes their best to 

  worse attributes. As typified in, for example, John  Howard address at the 2005 Anzac 

  Day service in Anzac Cove: 

  They [original Anzacs] bequeathed Australia a lastin g sense of national identity, they 

  sharpened our democratic temperament and our questioning eye towards authority. ’6 

  and the text on the Anzac memorial at Gallipoli: 

  ANZAC stood, and still stands, for reckless valour i n a good cause, for enterprise, 

  resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and enduran ce that will never own defeat. 7  

      It is probably true that the Gallipoli campaign  had a role to play in displaying to the 

  world the spirit and unity of a new nation. The his torical place of this event for 

  Australians is well documented and well promoted. However, ‘Gallipoli nationalism’ 

  refers to a fervour which is a stage advanced from a respect for the dead and an 

  acknowledgement of the character displayed by the Australians who engaged in the 

  battles at Gallipoli in 1915. In its extreme form t his type of nationalism is an engaged 

  reverence and religious rite of identification with  the national event as if it were god. 

  ‘Gallipoli nationalism’ is suspect if it develops i nto being emblematic of self-sacrificial service to a nation rather than a ritua l to express empathy for, and with, 

  those affected by wars and give acknowledgement to their courage and service to a 

  nation. 

      Belonging  and Membership â Anzac Day remembrance has developed from a 

  ritualised national memorial for those who died and  membership includes those who 

  actively served, those who lived through the years of war and the generations of 

  Australians who came after. The Day recalls an hist orical event of importance to the 

  national identity of Australians, thus all Australi ans have membership but, more than 

  that, the impact wars have on humanity is brought t o mind and the memorial to 

  specific combatants becomes a reminder of our human qualities and there can be an 

  extension of feeling for all who are similarly plac ed as combatants in wars. There is 

  the potential for this membership to extend the sen se of our  frailty, our  outrage over 

  war’s inhumanity, and our  courage to persons of different nationalities, as sentiments 

  belonging to being members of the human species.         

      Leadership â Anzac Day has been embraced by John Howard and the event given 

  credence as one that has shaped Australians’ unders tanding of themselves and the 

  manner in which their services are given in times o f international crises. The religious 

  pilgrimage aspect of Anzac Day has been actively en couraged during John Howard’s 

  Prime Ministership. Federal funding has been alloca ted to encourage this pilgrimage, 

  for example, the Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth 

  Affairs sponsors the Simpson Prize that allows eigh t students from each State and 

  Territory to be flown to Turkey with two teacher ch aperones to attend Anzac Day 

  ceremonies. 8      

  

      From the four unfolding events and policies des cribed, membership as Australians 

  could be inferred (from the actions taken by the Ho ward government) to be an 

  exclusive set of people, a group whose territorial borders are to be defended and 

  whose citizens need the protection of legislative c onstraints on ‘others’. Yet these 

  ‘others’ are also individuals. The Liberal Party do cument The Liberal Way: Federal 

  Platform , of Australia’ states a belief ‘in the innate wort h of the individual, in the 

  right to be independent, to own property and to ach ieve, and in the need to encourage 

  initiative and personal responsibility’. 9 This I regard as a statement reflecting the 

  perspective of a social class â for private ownersh ip that is coupled with achievement, 

  initiative and personal responsibility is specific to those who espouse the creed of 

  individualistic success. All individual achievement  occurs in a social setting whereas 

  individualistic success is a class understanding wh ich derives from the competitive 

  and commercial enterprise of personal gain. It may be true to say that this class 

  understanding is so pervasive nowadays that the coo perative qualities of social 

  behaviour is now an unseen and undervalued component of individual achievement.  

      Any further thoughts I have about class members hip being an exclusive one are 

  speculative. I speculate that the surety of actions  taken by Howard’s government 

  assumes a leadership that touts individualism and t his is done in the setting of being 

  members of a class with the intention to actively b e in an arena of political and 

  material success. Activities in these arenas need n ot correspond to being a good 

  citizen or neighbour to other nations, nor is it co mpulsory to fully acknowledge the 

  ‘innate worth of an individual’ by participating in  these activities. Yet it is in the 

  recognition of this quality of worth that character  is built. The promotion of ‘Gallipoli 

  nationalism’ attempts to build this character in yo ung Australians and for the 

  belonging felt to be nationalistic rather than huma nistic. Again, I would speculate that 

  this nationalistic belonging has the potential to o bscure the class division that 

  separates citizens who have accumulated wealth and materialistic prestige from those 

  who find no value in actively pursuing these ends o r are unable to compete with such 

  individuals. The latter group could be called an un derclass that exists to be of service, 

  or is outside of being ‘of service’, to an over-cla ss of wealth and materialistic prestige.                

  

      During John Howard’s visit to the White House i n July 2005, President George 

  Bush said at a joint press conference:  

  Australia and the United States share a commitment to freedom. ... But we also 

  understand that to defeat an ideology, you’ve got t o have a better ideology â and we do, 

  one based upon human rights and human dignity, minority rights and freedom. And the 

  thing I appreciate about John Howard is he understa nds that.  

  and part of John Howard’s response was: 

  Can I say to you Mr President, that the personal re lationship that we have established 

  on behalf of our two countries means a great deal t o me. But it is, as you rightly say, 

  based on a common view of the world that individual freedom is still the greatest glue 

  that nations and people can have; that societies th at honour the family as the most 

  stabilizing influence in our community, and also so cieties that recognise that the basis 

  of national wealth is individual wealth built on co mpetitive capitalism. Not everyone in 

  our two countries would entirely share every part o f that statement of my philosophical 

  beliefs, but I’m happy to say that in both countrie s a sufficient number of people in 

  recent times have shared those views to put smiles on both our faces. 10  

  When a particular ideology is taken to be an theore tical framework that will assist in 

  the formulation of policies that are to be enacted as legislation for the good of a 

  nation, then this is a staged process built upon a working knowledge of the affected 

  society and this process is not fairly represented by the shorthand notion of ‘particular 

  ideology’ equals ‘good of a nation’. There are cons iderations other than a good match 

  of policy to ideology. For there is a feature of id eologies that needs to be taken into 

  account: an ideology necessarily focuses firmly on an aspect of social existence and 

  this, I would claim, parts the social fabric of com munity and sets it somewhat apart 

  from, or is exclusionary of, other aspects of socia l existence.  

      It is the formation of the ideology which is re sponsible for setting apart some 

  feature of society, but the upholding of an ideolog y does not necessarily mean there is 

  not an awareness of its exclusionary focus. Despite  this possibility for awareness, it is 

  common for the rhetoric which supports an ideology to contend that a person must be 

  either for or against the position held, and this  rhetoric reinforces the exclusionary 

  focus. The strict adherence to an ideology without reference to the practicalities of 

  social cohesion between persons as a community (civic, national, or global) will be 

  selective as to what is of benefit: it is directed by the ideological conception rather 

  than the needs of communities and the accord between communities. Particular 

  ideologies can conflict with the interest in mainta ining a variety of social communities 

  which coexist as one society; John Scharzmantel has  argued that: ‘Explaining human 

  identity in terms of affiliation to different commu nities, with particularist loyalties, 

  deals a severe blow to the universalism that is bas ic to the liberal, as to the socialist, 

  tradition.’ 11  

  

      Those persons who become working Members of Parliament (MPs) have achieved 

  a powerful position within society, a position with  the potential to design, implement, 

  stall or block policies. Australian MPs have a soci al rank but are not usually 

  considered a class. This may have its roots in the idea that MPs be representatives of 

  citizens and a select class will act on behalf of i ts own group and only incidentally act 

  on behalf of all Australians. The phrase that ‘ther e is a relationship between belonging 

  to a political party and a person’s position within  a society as a member of a social 

  class’ was deliberately crafted. Membership to a po litical party that espouses an 

  ideology can include a sense of belonging to the gr oup of citizens that make up a 

  nation. Those who have a sense of belonging to an i deological creed will identify 

  themselves in social associations of like-minded pe ople. When this social association 

  gains power and prestige then a social class is est ablished. The Prime Minister of 

  Australia is a representative of the nation that is  understood as being made up of 

  groups of social associations which coexist, wherea s the Australian elector has to 

  accept an understanding of national leadership that  belongs in reality to a class of 

  persons with a particular ideology on their role in  society: the ideology of John 

  Howard’s liberalism.
