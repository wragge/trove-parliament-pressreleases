 NHILL LEARNING CENTRE TO BENEFIT FROM STRONGER COMMUNITIES FUNDING 

 The Member for Mallee, Andrew Broad, has made a much anticipated Stronger Communities 

 Programme (SCP) announcement today, revealing that the Nhill Learning Centre has been 

 successful in its application for funding under Round One of the Programme to support the 

 Paw Po Products Community Enterprise. 

 “Nhill stands as a wonderful example of successful refugee resettlement in regional Australia 

 and the community enterprise they have just received funding for, is further evidence of the 

 valuable partnership between the local and Karen refugee communities in the town. 

 “The Nhill Learning Centre has been consistently proactive in assisting the Karen refugees 

 and the Paw Po Products project is an extension of this and will deliver economic benefits for 

 all of Nhill, with job creation and a projected tourism boost through the increased publicity. 

 “The Paw Po Products enterprise will involve the establishment of a retail shop front in which 

 25 Karen women will sell their handmade goods, created using traditional Karen materials. 

 “It will add vibrancy to the town and provide great work opportunities for the Karen people 

 who have embraced Nhill, as their new home. 

 “This is precisely the kind of initiative that the SCP seeks to support and the Nhill Learning 

 Centre submitted a quality application and is thoroughly deserving of the funding.” 

 The Centre applied for funding under the Stronger Communities Programme, which was one 

 of the initiatives to come out of the 2015 Federal Budget, to assist with regional development. 

 The Programme aims to support smaller, community based projects. 

 A number of groups across the Wimmera and Mallee lodged applications and further 

 announcements regarding successful projects are still expected. 

 ENDS
