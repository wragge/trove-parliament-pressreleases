 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling THREE MORE BOATS ARRIVE ON RUDD’S  FIRST DAY BACK AS PM June 28, 2013

 Another three boats, carrying a total of 212 people, arrive as the Labor Party has opted to restore the very Prime Minister  who was responsible for undoing the robust border protection system that led to this crisis at our borders, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “The Rudd Government made the mistake of abolishing the Pacific Solution and as of the very next month the boats  started to arrive - since then 742 boats carrying over 45,000 people have arrived illegally in Australia,” Mr Keenan said.

 “The Prime Minister cannot be trusted to protect Australia’s borders as it was under his leadership that the people  smuggling syndicates were able to start up their lucrative business again.

 “The Rudd Government boasted that one of their greatest achievements was abolishing the Pacific Solution - a decision  that has now cost the Australian tax payer billions of dollars.

 “The previous Rudd Government had no answers on how to stop the flow of boats and the new Rudd Government doesn’t  either.

 “The Labor Party is good at stopping Prime Ministerships but they are hopeless at stopping the boats,” Mr Keenan said.
