 UNCLASSIFIED 

 THE HON NICOLA ROXON MP  Attorney-General  Minister for Emergency Management 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 16 October 2012   

 INDEPENDENT REVIEWER FOR ADVERSE SECURITY  ASSESSMENTS 

 The Gillard Government has announced today it will provide an independent review process  for those assessed to be a refugee but not granted a permanent visa as a result of an ASIO  adverse security assessment (ASA). 

 “Refugees in immigration detention who are the subject of an adverse security assessment  will have access to this new independent review option,” Attorney-General Nicola Roxon said. 

 “The Government has appointed The Hon Margaret Stone as the inaugural Independent  Reviewer. Margaret Stone is a former Judge of the Federal Court. Prior to being appointed to  the bench she had a distinguished academic career and was also a partner at Freehill  Hollingdale & Page. She is an eminent Australian with experience in legal, immigration and  national security matters. 

 “Under the terms of reference released today, the reviewer will examine the materials used by  ASIO and will provide a recommendation to the Director-General of Security and report these  findings to the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the  Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 

 “There will also be a regular 12 month periodic review of adverse security assessments for  refugees in immigration detention. 

 “The Government takes both national security and its international obligations to refugees  seriously.  

 “Independent review will not lower the bar for assessing a refugee’s risk to Australia’s national  security, but will provide greater openness and accountability in the security assessment  process.” 

 After the Reviewer completes their work on the initial round of applications, the Government  expects the reviewer to complete each application for review within three months.  

 Terms of Reference for the reviewer are attached. 

 ASIO only issues ASAs in a small number of cases. They make up less than one per cent of  all irregular maritime arrival visa security assessments undertaken since January 2010. 

 This announcement does not represent the Government’s response to the High Court’s  decision in M47 v the Director-General of Security & Others handed down last week.   The  Minister for Immigration continues to analyse that case and its implications. 

 The Government chose not to announce this review process while the case was before the  Court to ensure the review process was consistent with the Court’s decision.   

 The court found in M47 that ASIO’s assessment process was procedurally fair.    

 Despite this confirmation from the court, the government believes ASIO and the community  will benefit from this new review process adding an additional level of independent scrutiny to  ASIO decision making.

 Independent Review function - Terms of Reference 

 Role   The role of the Independent Reviewer (‘Reviewer’) is to conduct an independent advisory review of  Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) adverse security assessments (ASAs) furnished to  the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) in relation to those persons who remain in  immigration detention, having been found by DIAC to be owed protection obligations under  international law and to be ineligible for a permanent protection visa or who have had their  permanent protection visa cancelled because they are the subject of an ASA (‘eligible persons ’). 

 The Reviewer is required to examine all material relied upon by ASIO in making the security  assessment, provide an opinion to the Director-General of Security (‘Director-General’) on whether  the assessment is an appropriate outcome based on the material ASIO relied upon and make  recommendations accordingly, for the Director-General’s consideration. 

 The Reviewer will also conduct a periodic review of ASAs on eligible persons every 12 months. 

 Functions 

 Primary review function  The Reviewer’s primary function will be to conduct a review of ASAs furnished to DIAC in relation to  eligible persons who request the Reviewer to undertake a review in accordance with this process.  In  carrying out this function the Reviewer will: 

 ï· Conduct an independent review of an ASA furnished to DIAC in relation to an eligible person,  where that person has made an application to the Reviewer within 60 days of receiving  notice that the person is an eligible person to seek independent review of the ASA under this  process. 

 o If an application is received after 60 days, the Reviewer may use his or her discretion  in deciding whether to conduct a review. 

 o All eligible persons who are subject to ASAs furnished to DIAC prior to the  engagement of the Reviewer will be advised that they may apply for review within  60 days of being notified of their eligibility. 

 ï· Examine all of the ASIO material that was relied upon by ASIO in making the ASA, including  unclassified written reasons provided by ASIO for the eligible person, as well as other  relevant material, which may include submissions or representations made by the eligible  person.   Where a submission from an eligible person contains new information or claims,  this information should be referred to ASIO for consideration before the review proceeds. 

 ï· Upon conclusion of every review, form and record in writing an opinion as to whether the  assessment is an appropriate outcome based on the material ASIO relied upon (including  any new material referred to ASIO)and provide such opinion to the Director-General,  including recommendations as appropriate.   

 2 

 ï· Provide a copy of that written opinion to the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS). 

 ï· Advise the subject of the security assessment in writing of the outcome of the review.  This  will include providing a document in unclassified form, to the extent possible without  prejudicing national security1 as advised by the Director-General, the Reviewer’s opinion,  reasons and any recommendations made and the outcome of the Director-General’s  consideration of the opinion and recommendations.  

 Periodic review function  The Reviewer will, after commencement of the Review mechanism, conduct a periodic review every  12 months of ASAs in relation to eligible persons, from either the more recent of: 

 ï· the date of the commencement of the Review process, or  

 ï· if an ASA is issued after the commencement of the Review process, the date that the ASA  was furnished to DIAC, or  

 ï· from the time the Reviewer completed an independent review of an ASA at the request of  the eligible person. 

 In carrying out this function the Reviewer will: 

 ï· Obtain ASIO security advice on whether ASIO holdings contain any new information relevant  to the eligible person that was not available when the ASA was furnished to DIAC.  Where  ASIO identifies new information, the Reviewer will obtain ASIO advice on the relevance of  that information to the ASA.  

 ï· Where ASIO advises the Reviewer that there is new information that is relevant to the ASA,  ASIO will reconsider the ASA in light of the new information and advise the Reviewer of the  outcome of the reconsideration. 

 ï· The Reviewer will receive a report from ASIO on the conduct and conclusions of ASIO’s  reconsideration of the ASA in light of the new information.  The Reviewer will maintain  discretion to request further information if the Reviewer thinks appropriate. 

 ï· The Reviewer will form and record in writing an opinion as to the status of the ASA and  where relevant, whether the conclusion ASIO made on any new material was an appropriate  outcome, and provide such opinion to the Director-General, including recommendations as  appropriate.   

 Requirements in performing functions  ï· The Reviewer will apply the Protective Security Policy Framework (‘PSPF’) at all times during  the review process. 

 

 1  Throughout this document the word ‘security’ is a reference to ‘security’ as defined in section 4 of the ASIO  Act 1979. 

 3 

 ï· Throughout the review process, the Reviewer will obtain and adhere to ASIO’s security  advice on the protection of ASIO’s intelligence capability when the Reviewer is  communicating, either orally or in writing, within the public domain including directly with  the eligible person, when carrying out his or her function. 2 

 ï· In forming an opinion the Reviewer will take into account ASIO’s role and statutory functions  including ASIO’s mission to identify and investigate threats to security and provide advice to  protect Australia, its people and its interests and that, therefore, ASIO’s security  assessments are anticipatory in nature, enabling preventive action to be taken.  

 ï· The Reviewer will take into account that security assessments are made in the interests of  security and any relevant legislative test ASIO was required to consider in making the  security assessment.  

 ï· Independent advisory review will be available to eligible persons who are the subject of  ASAs furnished to DIAC prior to the appointment of the Reviewer.  Upon commencement in  the position, these persons will be notified of their eligibility to request a review under this  process. 

 ï· The Reviewer will prioritise the review of security assessments for eligible persons furnished  prior to the appointment of the Reviewer as expeditiously as possible.  For future cases,  once the Reviewer has completed reviews for the pre-existing caseload, the Reviewer will  seek to complete reviews within three months. 

 ï·  The Reviewer will work with ASIO, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the  Attorney-General’s Department to ensure appropriate materials are provided to eligible  persons when they are notified of an ASA, outlining their rights to seek review.  The  materials will use simple language and be translated into foreign languages. 

 Reporting  The Reviewer is required to prepare and provide statistics annually for inclusion in ASIO’s  unclassified report on the following: 

 ï·  The number of adverse security assessments reviewed during the preceding financial year;  

 ï· Of those adverse security assessments, the number of assessments where the Reviewer  formed the opinion that the assessment was/was not an appropriate outcome based on the  material relied upon by ASIO and the number of times the Reviewer recommended that the  Director-General review the security assessment; 

 ï· The number of occasions where the Director-General has/has not accepted and actioned the  recommendations of the Reviewer 

 

 2  ASIO will provide security advice on the intended content of external communications within the public  domain including directly with an eligible person, to ensure those communications do not prejudice security  through the disclosure of ASIO’s capabilities including the identity of its officers, sources, operational  methodologies, operations, investigations and liaison partners. 

 4 

 ï· The number, if any, of cases where the outcome of any reassessment was different to the  original ASA; and 

 ï· The number of periodic reviews conducted by the Reviewer in the preceding financial year.  

 Engagement with ASIO      ï· When an eligible person makes a request for independent review, ASIO will provide an  unclassified written summary of reasons for the decision to issue an adverse security  assessment to the Reviewer on the basis that it will be provided to the eligible person.  The 

 reasons will include information that can be provided to the eligible person to the extent  able without prejudicing the interests of security.          

 ï· ASIO will endeavour to provide the Reviewer with the necessary support and assistance to  enable him or her to carry out the function independently together with the use of secure  ASIO premises.   This support will include the initial provision of all information relied upon  by ASIO in making the assessment for every review commenced under this process at the  request of an eligible person. 

 ï· Where it appears to the Reviewer that he or she may arrive at an opinion that it was not an  appropriate outcome that ASIO furnished the ASA on the material ASIO relied upon,  including where that opinion is based upon information that was not available to ASIO when  the security assessment was furnished to DIAC, the Reviewer will provide the  Director-General with a reasonable opportunity to comment, before finalising the opinion.
