  MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDE 

  FA 71 29 JULY 1996 

  BURUNDI 

  I deplore the killings of the past few weeks in Burundi and am concerned about the recent  military coup. There is now a worrying cycle of violence in that country which has the  potential to spill over into Burundi's neighbours and to destabilise even the further the Great  Lakes region through large-scale refugee movements. 

  I strongly encourage all sectors of Burundi's population to engage in constructive negotiations  to bring about a peaceful, durable solution, to prevent the escalation of violence and to  achieve without delay the restoration of democratic institutions and processes. 

  I commend the efforts of former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere to bring about a  negotiated settlement to Burundi's crisis. As a practical demonstration of our concern the  Australian Government has provided $25, 000 to support these mediation efforts.
