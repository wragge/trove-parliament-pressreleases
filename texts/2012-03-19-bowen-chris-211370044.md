 New Single Protection Visa Process Set to Commence

 New Single Protection Visa  Process Set to Commence

 Monday, 19 March 2012

 The new single protection visa process announced last year for both  boat and air arrivals will apply from 24 March, the Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said today.

 Mr Bowen announced in November last year that the government  would be changing the two parallel processes for boat and air arrivals  to a single system for all asylum seekers.

 'The current onshore arrangements for application and independent  review through the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) system will now  apply to all people seeking asylum in Australia, regardless of their  mode of arrival, from 24 March 2012,' Mr Bowen said.

 'Under the new framework, people who arrive by boat from that date  will have their claims heard under a statutory process with merits  review by the RRT on appeal, instead of the previous Independent  Merits Review (IMR) system.

 'This means the protection obligations assessment process for irregular  maritime arrivals will be consistent with that of onshore protection visa  applicants.'

 Mr Bowen said with the legislative impasse over offshore processing  and the resulting move towards greater community placement, there  was no longer any benefit to parallel processing arrangements for  offshore entry persons.

 'The Malaysia Arrangement presented a genuinely innovative regional  response to the people smuggling problem, but the High Court's  decision and Tony Abbott's negativity in blocking offshore processing  prevent the Government from pursuing this option,' he said.

 'It is therefore only prudent to introduce this new single, consistent and  efficient process.'

 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has consulted  extensively with key stakeholders, including non-government

 organisations, refugee advocate groups and other agencies in  developing the new framework.

 The new system will apply to asylum seekers who arrive in Australia  from 24 March as well as those who arrived prior to that date but had  not yet had a primary assessment interview.

 Those who are currently having their asylum claims assessed in the  non-statutory process will continue in that process with access to  existing IMR arrangements. All asylum seekers will continue to have  access to judicial review.

 DIAC will also commence processing complementary protection claims  as part of the protection visa framework from 24 March, in line with  legislation passed by the Australian Parliament in September 2011.

 This will mean people facing certain types of harm - not covered by the  Refugee Convention but still warranting protection - will be recognised  sooner, making the process more efficient and less stressful for  vulnerable people at risk of violation of their fundamental human rights.

 Mr Bowen said the Government remained committed to ensuring the  timely and efficient consideration of claims for protection and reduce  the time asylum seekers spent in immigration detention or in  community arrangements awaiting an outcome.
