  BEAZLEY:

  Today more Australians come to know the likely impact 
of Mr Howard's GST when they look at their petrol bowser and contemplate 
the fact that it's going to be a huge jump in petrol prices courtesy 
of it when it becomes a tax on a tax. Australians will also know, particularly 
those with mortgages earning less than $50,000 a year, that GST interest 
rate rises have the capacity to wipe out any income tax benefit that 
they could conceivably get and they'll thank John Howard for that. And, 
finally, what myself and my colleagues are doing at the moment is developing 
our policies to reverse the dumbing down of Australia with cuts to our 
research and development efforts and cuts to education. We are the only 
country in the industrialised world where that has taken place over 
the course of the last three years. And we have to turn that around. 
The nations which succeed this century are the nations that focus on 
the knowledge economy and the skills to exploit it. 

  JOURNALIST:

  Just what effect will interest rate rises have on 
the ordinary Australian taxpayer?

  BEAZLEY:

  These interest rate rises, and they'll come in several 
amounts, will wipe out any benefits from tax cuts associated with a 
GST and they'll make life that much harder. A lot of Australians are 
asking the question: if the economy is supposed to be doing so well, 
why don't myself and my family feel it?

  JOURNALIST:

  Do you think Australians understood that petrol prices 
would go up under a GST? I think there were many under the perception 
that those taxes and excises would be wiped out.

  BEAZLEY:

  I think a lot of Australians believed that the GST 
would replace the excises. In fact, it only partially replaces them. 
And with petrol prices headed where they are now, the probability is 
that certainly everybody in regional Australia will experience a major 
price impact from the tax on the tax, the GST. And in large parts of 
the metropolitan area and some times of the year, all of us will. 

  JOURNALIST:

  What's your response to news that 28 Employment National 
[offices] around the bush will be closed?

  BEAZLEY:

  John Howard said two days ago that he would not tolerate 
one closure of one Commonwealth outlet anywhere around the country. 
Well, we have these questions for John Howard. What's shutting down 
in Telstra? What's shutting down in the post office? What's shutting 
down with Employment National? Of course, there continues to be, no 
matter what the Prime Minister says, unabated Commonwealth retreat from 
the bush. 

  JOURNALIST:

  Does this fly in the face of Howard's pledge to look 
after the bush?

  BEAZLEY:

  This renders his approach completely hypocritical. 
He had no intention of, in fact, standing his Ministers up on the bush. 
All he wanted was to create an argument for privatising Telstra. People 
in the bush are sick of being exploited for city politician's ideological 
gallivants. 

  JOURNALIST:

  Is there a problem between yourself and Cheryl Kernot, 
Mr Beazley?

  BEAZLEY:

  None at all. She is an active and effective member 
of my front bench. She's a person in whom many Australians have a great 
deal of confidence. And I must say I've been concerned with the way 
in which she has been pursued while she has been obviously ill. Ill 
with an affliction which most Australian families experience in one 
of their kids at some point of time, as I have myself.

  JOURNALIST:

  Which illness is that?

  BEAZLEY:

  Glandular fever.

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Howard has accused the 
Opposition this morning of blocking moves to force illegal refugees 
to go home. Is Labor trying to do that?

  BEAZLEY:

  Mr Howard is trying to find anything to talk about 
but the goods and services tax which every Australian wants to know 
something about. I think you're going to find Mr Howard inventing all 
sorts of things about the Opposition and inventing all sorts of things 
about his policies with regard to the bush or any other topic you care 
to name. Because Mr Howard has a massive evasion problem in his hands. 
How to evade discussing the big tax.

  JOURNALIST:

  What do you think of Cheryl Kernot's use of a wig 
on the weekend?

  BEAZLEY:

  Look, I don't comment on the appearance of my colleagues, 
suffice it to say if I did they'd just take a look at me.

  JOURNALIST:

  You're discussing the knowledge nation today. When 
are going…particular ideas and when are we going to see them?

  BEAZLEY:

  You've already actually seen a fair bit out from 
us on that: encouraging people into the world of work, we still are 
pursuing the idea of tax credits, for example, to encourage people who 
face enormous effective marginal tax rates as they move off the unemployed 
list. And we have, of course, already called for a reversal of the continued 
decline of resources going to higher education. What we don't agree 
with is Mr Howard's suggestion that every child should have the right 
to ride their bikes home in peak hour traffic. We don't think that's 
an adequate education policy. 

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Beazley, have you promised Cheryl Kernot a prominent 
role in, you know, in your Shadow Cabinet this year?

  BEAZLEY:

  Well, how does Employment Spokesperson grab you? 
I reckon that will do.

  JOURNALIST:

  What can you expect from her now that she's back?

  BEAZLEY:

  Well, I hope she eases back slowly into the affairs 
of her portfolio. It's a difficult thing to overcome, the impact of 
the illness that she's had. Difficult for anyone who experiences that. 
And she needs to take the time to read around the issues related to 
her portfolio - she's actually done that for a good part of the last 
couple of months. Because employment issues are going to be central 
of our campaign over the next couple of years.

  JOURNALIST:

  Can she live up to her 'star recruit' status?

  BEAZLEY:

  She already has for my mind. She's been a tremendously 
active campaigner for the Labor Party in ways in which the media doesn't 
often see. She is enormously in demand for campaigning activities, particularly 
in regional Australia. And she's fulfilled that to the great joy and 
delight of many hardworking Labor members around the country.

  JOURNALIST:

  Laurie Brereton has described her performance, the 
issue surrounding her as a bit of a 'circus'.

  BEAZLEY:

  He described the treatment of her as a circus. And 
that's not an unreasonable description of folk meandering in and out 
of hospitals dressed in dressing gowns, you know, pretending to be delivery 
boys with flowers. I mean, what would you describe that as?

  JOURNALIST:

  ...happened?

  BEAZLEY:

  That's exactly what's happened over the course of 
the last couple of months.

  JOURNALIST:

  I'm not a doctor, but I guess glandular fever...

  BEAZLEY:

  I'm glad to hear that!

  JOURNALIST:

  ...comes back now and again.

  BEAZLEY:

  Oh, yes.

  JOURNALIST:

  So, there is a danger she can get ill. What would 
happen if she was to fall ill again?

  BEAZLEY:

  Well, I think that she's fine, like most people who 
are who have it, provided that she takes it easy as she builds up her 
workload again. I think she'll be a very effective member of our Government. 
I'm sure if you went through Parliament you'd find that quite a substantial 
number of members of Parliament have had glandular fever at some point 
of time in their lives. It's not uncommon. And they would have all, 
by conducting themselves sensibly, guaranteed themselves a long life 
in politics.

  JOURNALIST:

  So, you see her as fairly key player in your strategies, 
then?

  BEAZLEY:

  Yes, she is. There's no question about that.

  JOURNALIST:

  A number of Labor MPs have given unattributed quotes 
that have been less supportive of Cheryl in the last week or so. What 
do you say to them?

  BEAZLEY:

  And a large number have given attributed quotes that 
have been very supportive. I'm always mindful that the unattributed 
quote can be the product of a chap with his feet propped on the desk 
and a cigarette and a nice glass of red wine and a struggle with a deadline.

  Ends
