  JOINT STATEMENT

  SHADOW MINISTER FOR JUSTICE & CUSTOMS

  

  CON SCIACCA MP

  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION

  GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO CURB ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
CLEARLY NOT WORKING

  

  The recent frequent arrival of boats carrying ill egal immigrants 
- including one with more than 300 people on board - clearly shows that 
Government measures intended to curb illegal immigrants are simply not 
working, Shadow Minister for Immigration, Con Sciacca and Shadow Minister 
for Justice and Customs, Duncan Kerr, said today.

  

 The Shadow Ministers are critical of the Government’s 
sloppy performance in dealing with this national emergency.

  

 “Our borders have become a revolving door for anyone 
who wants to run a people smuggling business,” Mr Sciacca said.

  

 “But the Government seems more interested in opening 
new inquiries, putting on more consultants and blaming the Opposition, 
than they are in fixing the problem.”

  

 Mr Sciacca said that, to date, the Government had 
commissioned the Heggen Inquiry, the Max Moore-Wilton Inquiry and recently 
had appointed a consultative committee to advise the Department of Immigration 
on illegal immigration matters.

  

 “The Government has been grappling with this problem 
for over twelve months and, clearly, whatever they are doing is simply 
not working,” Mr Sciacca said.

  

 “The Government’s claim that the Opposition was 
obstructing efforts to remove illegal immigrants by not passing legislation 
was not only incorrect but just a way to cover up their own incompetence.

  

 “The Opposition has made it clear to the Government 
that it will support any reasonable measure, including giving bi-partisan 
support to legislation that is designed to stop these people-smuggling 
rackets.”

  

 Labor has already supported a number of measures, 
including:

  

  ·  Information exchange and data matching between agencies to 
improve tracking overstayers and illegal workers;

  

  ·  taking 
away the right of illegal immigrants to have lawyers present unless 
they specifically ask for them;

  

  ·  changes 
to refugee regulations to address unfounded claims for refugee status 
designed to hit those seeking to abuse the system, while protecting 
genuine claimants;

  

  ·  heavily 
increasing fines for people-smuggling operations, and those associated 
with these operations; and

  

  ·  toughening 
border control, forfeiture and seizure measures designed to exact a 
heavy cost on boat owners operating a people-smuggling racket, and supporting 
the arming of Customs Officers.

  

  Mr Kerr said the Government is obviously frustrated at the lack of 
succ ess their initiatives are having and are thrashing around 
trying to blame their obvious incompetence on everybody but themselves.

  

  “There is no doubt that more resources need to be allocated to stopping 
illegal immigrants at their source,” Mr Kerr said.

  

  “ For example, the Government’s recent success in stopping 
illegal immigrants from the Fujian Province in China is evidence that 
that strategy can work. They should be putting more effort into operations 
of this nature.

  

 “As a result of recommendations from the Max Moore-Wilton 
Inquiry, the Prime Minister has allocated $124 million to combat the 
problem and promised more boats, planes, personnel and resources. So 
far, the only result of these measures has been that, in the past five 
weeks, some five boats had infiltrated our borders and over 600 illegal 
immigrants had reached our shores.

  

 “The Opposition is now calling on the Government 
to inform the public where these funds have gone, what measures have 
been taken and why the problem is getting worse.

  

 “We will cooperate with the Government on any measure 
that will stop non-genuine refugees from entering our country,” Mr 
Kerr said.
