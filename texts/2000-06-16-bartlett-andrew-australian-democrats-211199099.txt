 Press Release Dated: 16 Jun 2000 Press Release Number: 00/353 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Government Videos "Complete Waste of Time and Money" The Australian Democrats have labelled the videos documenting the perils of illegal travel, released by Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock, as a complete waste of time and taxpayers’ money.

 “Once again, Mr Ruddock is attacking the victim and not the perpetrator. He claims the videos, which are to be released in countries of first asylum, will stop people from putting their lives in the hands of smugglers,” Senator Andrew Bartlett said.

 “There are three reasons why this concept is an ill-founded waste of public money.

 “The image of people-smugglers watching the video and deciding not to transport their cargo in case they are eaten by a crocodile is ridiculous. These people don’t care what happens to the refugees they transport.

 “Similarly, it is simply ludicrous to think that people will meekly decide to return to the country they have fled from if and when they ever see the video.

 “Finally, Mr Ruddock intends to release the videos to countries which are already overwhelmed by refugees. This is simply asking these countries to take on one more burden - the burden of, first of all, finding the appropriate audience and then screening the videos.

 “What Mr Ruddock fails to see is that becoming a refugee is not a lifestyle choice: it’s a choice between life or death.

 “The choice to flee is made before you leave the country in which you are in danger not after or during transit. For refugees there is no going back.

 “The videos will achieve nothing, they will cost taxpayers money and they

 will damage Australia’s reputation on the world stage,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The real disappointment is that taxpayers have paid for trips by the Minister to travel extensively around the world to talk to governments about ways in which to alleviate this global problem. Yet he still fails to realise that this is an issue of international responsibility to people in need, not an issue of preventing illegal migration.

 “All refugees, no matter what country they first enter, do so as illegal migrants. It is the act of seeking asylum which makes them legal,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
