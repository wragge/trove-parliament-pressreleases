 More Long Term Detainees Invited to Apply for New Visa

 VPS 080/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, announced today that she had decided to invite a further 50 long term immigration detainees to apply  for the new Removal Pending Bridging Visa.

 ‘This is in addition to the 17 people I had already invited to apply for the visa,’ the Minister said.

 ‘The invitation to these further 50 detainees, follows my announcement last week of revised guidelines for the new visa.

 ‘The invitations to these 50 people will be delivered from today.

 ‘Those who had already received invitations will be contacted again about the revised requirements of the new RPBV and be asked if they would  like to apply.

 ‘All those receiving the invitation have been in immigration detention for more than two years, except for seven people who are already in the  community on other Bridging Visas.

 ‘My department will continue to regularly assess the suitability of detainees for my consideration for the RPBV.

 ‘The new visa provides holders with a range of benefits, including Centrelink Special Benefit, Medicare and the right to work.’

 The Minister said there was no formal application process for the new visa and access is dependent on an invitation from the Minister and  eligibility against the criteria for the visa, which includes character and security checks.
