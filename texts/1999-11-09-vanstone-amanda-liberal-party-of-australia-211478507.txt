  Minister for Justice & Customs

  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone

  Senator for South Australia

  

 160/99 

 Tuesday 9 November 1999

  

  Minister for Justice and Customs and Acting Minister for Immigration,  
Senator Amanda Vanstone, today called on the Opposition to support the 
Government’s initiatives to make Australia a less-attractive destination 
for illegal immigrants.

  

 Senator Vanstone said it was time the Opposition stopped 
attacking the men and women who operated Australia’s coastal surveillance 
system and supported Government initiatives that would do something 
positive to stem the flow of illegal immigrants.

  

 “Changes to the visa system introduced by the Government 
will make Australia a less attractive destination for illegal immigrants, 
but the Opposition is wavering in its support for the measures,” Senator 
Vanstone said.

  

  “The new system of temporary protection visas prevents unauthorised 
arrivals who are refugees from automatically accessing the benefits 
of permanent residence, which makes Australia an attractive destination 
to people smugglers. The Regulation will prevent unauthorised arrivals 
from obtaining permanent protection visas and the benefits, particularly 
family reunion, which appear to attract traffickers and forum shoppers.

  

  “In addition, if they leave Australia. the temporary visa will cease 
and they will have no automatic right of return.

  

  ““Without these benefits, Australia will be a less attractive 
destination for people smugglers.

  

 “The Government expects a move to disallow the regulations 
that make these changes.

  

  “If the Labor Opposition isn’t willing to support the Government 
in this effort, Australia will continue to be an attractive destination 
for people smugglers.

  

 “There are a number of countries that have various 
forms of temporary protection as part of their arrangements for refugees, 
including Canada, the United States, Denmark, France and Germany.

  

 The key point however is that Australia’s protection 
regime is consistent with our protection obligations. We have chosen 
to be more generous than we are obliged to be to people who play by 
the rules, those people who seek to enter Australia legally.

  

 “Instead of doing something positive about the problem 
by declaring its support for this and other measures being proposed 
by the Government, the Opposition has persisted in attacking the men 
and women of Customs Coastwatch and the Defence forces who are working 
tirelessly to detect and intercept the current wave of would-be illegal 
immigrants,” she said.

  

 Senator Vanstone said that two more boat loads of 
suspected illegal immigrants had been detected yesterday in the Indian 
Ocean off the Western Australian Coast.

  

 She said that late yesterday a Coastwatch flight had 
detected an Indonesian fishing vessel with 25 suspected illegal immigrants 
and two crew members about 80 kilometres south of Ashmore Reef.

  

 The vessel was then intercepted by the Australian 
Customs vessel Botany Bay which had escorted it to Ashmore Reef.

  

 Overnight, Police at Christmas lsland had intercepted 
another vessel with 160 suspected illegal immigrants on board.

  

  “As the recent spate of foiled attempts to illegally enter Australia 
show, our coastal surveillance system is working effectively, but unless 
the Opposition is prepared to support the Government’s visa initiative, 
the boats will just keep on coming,” Senator Vanstone said.

  

  “With Australia’s 37 000 km coastline it is impossible to guarantee 
that there is an impenetrable barrier around the country - indeed no  
country in the world can or would guarantee that.

  

 “However, I can guarantee that Australia has an 
effective coastal surveillance system. ln addition to Customs Coastwatch 
fleet of aircraft they have direct use of Customs and Navy Patrol boats 
and RAAF P0-3 Orion aircraft and other resources.

  

 “It is a sophisticated, strategically-driven operation 
that delivers all the best features of a Coast Guard without additional 
bureaucracy or the huge overheads associated with a stand alone service.

  

 “The men and women of Coastwatch and the Defence 
Forces are providing an efficient and cost-effective civil coastal surveillance 
service,” Senator Vanstone said.

  

  Commenting on Opposition calls for a separate Coast Guard, Senator 
Vanstone said that creating such a service using existing resources 
would simply be creating a third organisation to do the job which is 
already being done well by Customs with the assista nce of Defence 
resources.

  

 “On the other hand, creating a new Coast Guard with 
its own resources and organisational overheads would be hugely expensive 
and it is doubtful that it would deliver any better service than the 
current system. Indeed, even Mr Beazley in his 1984 report on coastal 
surveillance ruled the Coast Guard option out as not being cost effective.”

  

 The Government had recognised the need for additional 
resources following the Prime Minister’s Task Force report on illegal 
immigration in June this year. Additional funding was provided for two 
new Dash 8 surveillance aircraft and a night-capable helicopter to operate 
in the Torres Strait, she said.

  

 The helicopter would be operating from next month 
and the two Dash 8 aircraft were currently on the production line being 
manufactured to Coastwatch’s specifications and would be delivered 
in July and August next year. The surveillance aircraft would have the 
latest in digital radar technology and state of the art infra red and 
video technology. In addition a new National Surveillance Centre with 
enhanced electronic links to Defence and other information sources would 
be operational early in 2000.

  

 “The Government has also introduced legislation 
to provide enhanced powers that will enable Customs officers to more 
effectively deal with illegal activities at sea. These powers are not 
only aimed at illegal immigration but provide more teeth to fight international 
drug smugglers,” Senator Vanstone said.

  

 “The new measures will enable Customs officers to 
exercise more powers at sea and beyond the traditional 12-mile limit.”

  

 She said arrangements were being made to bring the 
latest boat loads of suspected illegal immigrants to Australia for processing 
by Department of Immigration officials.

  

 A separate announcement today contains details of 
new plans for housing future suspected illegal entrants at Woomera, 
in South Australia’s far north.
