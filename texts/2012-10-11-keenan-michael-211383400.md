 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling A daily hat-trick for the people smugglers as  three more boats intercepted October 12, 2012

 The latest illegal boat to be intercepted has completed the daily hat-trick for the people smugglers, amid renewed  concerns of possible riots in the Christmas Island detention centre, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “In the past week alone there have been 8 illegal boat arrivals, carrying well over 400 passengers, and this staggering rate  of arrivals is showing no sign of slowing despite the Government’s claims that their backflip on offshore processing is  slowing the boats,” Mr Keenan said.

 “When you have over 12,000 people on 181 boats arriving illegally on our shores in only the tenth month of this year, it is  clear that not only has this Government failed to enforce new offshore processing policies effectively but there has been a  complete failure to provide a basic border protection regime.

 “The reality is that every time the people smugglers have tested this Government’s resolve they have won, as Labor  always chooses the path of least resistance.

 “If the people smugglers have always won in the past then why would they think Labor’s latest policy attempts to stop the  boats will be any different?

 “It will take a Coalition Government to introduce and enforce the tough border protection measures needed to stop this evil  trade in human misery. 

 “The Government must reinstate the full suite of Coalition border protection policies to restore order and control to  Australia’s borders - if they cannot do this then they must call an election,” Mr Keenan said.
