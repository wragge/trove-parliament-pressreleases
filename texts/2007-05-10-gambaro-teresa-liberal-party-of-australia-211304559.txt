 Assistant Minister welcomes Togolese refugees to Ballarat  Thursday, 10 May 2007   

 Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Teresa Gambaro has  congratulated the City of Ballarat on its commitment to refugees as it  welcomes two families from the African nation of Togo today.  The Togolese families are the first refugees to be settled in the town directly  from overseas under the Australian Government’s regional humanitarian  settlement initiative.  ‘Regional towns can offer very positive settlement outcomes for many  refugees,’ Ms Gambaro said  ‘Country communities provide a warm welcome, friendship and support for  these families, many of whom have experienced great hardship and trauma.  ‘Some refugees also find it easier to secure employment in regional towns,  helping provide security for their families and allowing them to participate in  Australian society.  ‘The Ballarat settlement initiative is an example of successful cooperation  between the Victorian and Australian Governments.’  Ms Gambaro said planning for refugee settlement in Ballarat had been  underway for some time and was supported by the involvement of the local  government, local service providers and community groups.  The department’s Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy will help the  newly arrived Togolese to find accommodation, supply them with household  goods, provide case management and referral services, and help them adjust  to Australian life.  Settlement of up to ten Togolese families in the town is planned over the next  12 months.  An evaluation will follow to examine how well settlement is progressing,  identify areas for improvement, and consider the town’s capacity for ongoing  refugee settlement.  Ms Gambaro said the Togolese settlement in Ballarat followed a successful  settlement programme in Shepparton, where a small community of Congolese  families were settled in the town from November 2005.  A recent evaluation of the Shepparton Humanitarian Settlement Pilot,  commissioned by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, found that  settlement in Shepparton had been very positive both for the town and for the  Congolese entrants.  ‘Ballarat’s commitment to assisting these families demonstrates both  compassion and a commitment to a fair go for all,’ Ms Gambaro added.
