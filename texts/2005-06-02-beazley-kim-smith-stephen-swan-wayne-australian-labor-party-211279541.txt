 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER  THE HON KIM BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH WAYNE SWAN AND  STEPHEN SMITH, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA   

 1 JUNE 2005  E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:  National  Accounts,  Prime Minister’s Export and  Infrastructure Taskforce Report, Mandatory Detention, SAS,   

 BEAZLEY: Thanks for coming along.  I thought we might have a bit of a  chat about the National Accounts and one or two other things.  So, I’ll put Wayne  on first then I’ll say something and Stephen you get stuck in.   

 SWAN: Thanks very much Kim.  I just wanted to make some brief  comments about the National Accounts because we’ve have a very weak start to  growth for this year, 0.7 per cent for the March quarter is below market 

 expectations.  And if it wasn’t for the big jump in inventories, growth would have  been negative 0.4 per cent for the quarter.  Growth for the year to March is 1.9  per cent which I don’t think is good enough given the challenges that our country  faces.  It’s further evidence of a need for economic reform.  Further evidence for  the need for real incentive in the tax system, for national Leadership in  infrastructure and for dealing with our skills crisis.  It’s also concerning to see in  these figures that business investment is down 2.6 per cent and productivity  growth is negative every quarter for the year.  Year to March down minus 2.4 per  cent, the biggest fall in 19 years.  Now, I fail to see how the Treasurer can  possibly be happy with this rate of growth.  The terms of trade are projected at a  50 year high and in that environment the best the Treasurer can be happy with is  1.9 per cent.  We must simply aim to do a lot better than that.  Thank you.   

 BEAZLEY: One of the issues that the Reserve Bank has drawn attention  to and for that matter the OECD and for that matter the BCA is the issue of  national Leadership on infrastructure, that one of the impediments, the barriers to  the sort of growth that our terms of trade would indicate that we ought to feel  entitled to enjoy is that we have blockages in our national infrastructure as well  as blockages in skills.   

 

 The Prime Minister came out with this Infrastructure Taskforce Report today.   When he launched that Taskforce Report I said several things about it.  Firstly it  was basically a mechanism to evade discussion about national Leadership.  

 Secondly, that it would finger point at the States.  And, thirdly, that it would not  necessarily foreshadow any ongoing federal commitment.  The reviews of what it 

 has produced are mixed.  We welcome the fact that the Taskforce has suggested  a number of things that we in the Australian Labor Party think are important and  have been arguing for some time.  To wit an audit of what it is we that we need  and they’ve suggested, that and to take the issue to COAG.  Well, that’s where  we think national Leadership begins at the Council of Australian Governments.   We think that what we now need in infrastructure is national Leadership.   Not  just one-off reports.     

 The one thing in this report we absolutely disagree with is a suggestion there is  no crisis in infrastructure.  It’s not just a Labor Party view.  It;s the view of  business, it’s the view of external analysis of Australia.  It’s the view of the  Reserve Bank, it’s a major impediment to growth.  John Howard has got to walk  into this COAG meeting and determine on national Leadership for the  development of Australian infrastructure the audit of what we need and the  implementation of what that audit suggests.  In short, he needs the Infrastructure  Council that the Labor Party announced should be put in place at the beginning  of this year and reiterated with more detail on it in our response to the Budget.     

 There are one or two other issues around as well and I just want to, though it’s  not particularly directly related to this mention one of them which you may like to  question us on later.  And that is the issue of airport security.  Quite frankly this is  a complete shambles.  There is a scandal a day on the issue of airport security  and the Government has gone completely complacent on it.  It now appears that  having shifted Mr Palmer out of the area of aviation security they want to bring an  international expert back into the area to replace the job that he ought to be  doing.  But that of course raises a huge series of questions about whether or not  they’ll have the expertise to get up to speed quickly enough on it.  But the  incompetence that this government is now displaying on airport security should  be a worry to all Australians and indeed has become a worry to all Australians.   They cannot give us the guarantees that they have a comprehension of what is  going on in those airports in a way that makes us feel safe.  What they’re  constantly doing is ducking for cover.  Putting out the spin but not putting in place  the essential measures needed to deal with the problems.     

 As on infrastructure, the spin’s out there.  They’re great on spin but when it  comes to spend or effectiveness this government lacks enormously.   

 SMITH: Thanks very much Kim.  Just some brief remarks on the  Infrastructure Report.  It’s worth reminding ourselves the context of the report.   Neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer paid any attention to infrastructure  matters until they were sprung by the Reserve Bank in March when the Reserve  increased interest rates by 0.25 basis points.  Infrastructure capacity constraints  and bottlenecks were one of the two reasons the Reserve pointed to.  We then  saw a flurry of activity with the Treasurer for the first time taking an interest in the 

 Parliament and secondly the Prime Minister establishing this Taskforce and we  see the subsequent report.   

 

 What most people don’t appreciate, but is worth now putting on the record, is that  whilst most people remember the Reserve’s mention in March when it increased  interest rates, that was actually the eleventh mention by the Reserve Bank in  either quarterly bulletins or monetary statements since May 2001.  That reflects  the complete complacency so far as the Treasurer is concerned in this area.     

 Secondly, whilst we have this Taskforce Report, it’s actually the eighth or the  ninth interdepartmental or departmental or agency report or inquiry into  infrastructure matters over the last 12 months.  This one, albeit with narrow  Terms of Reference, does have a number of things which are very encouraging.     

 There are three areas where it’s a ringing endorsement of Labor’s approach,  firstly that these issues should go to COAG.  We’ve been arguing for sometime  that what is required here is national Leadership, national cooperation.  The  community wants to see the blame shifting and the buck passing stop. They want  to see outcomes and results.  So, we’re pleased that the Taskforce has  recommended that a range of these issues go to COAG.     

 Secondly, we see recommendations for a one stop shop.  That’s essentially  Labor’s Infrastructure Australia.  That’s the policy, that’s the Commonwealth  Authority that Kim Beazley announced on Budget Reply night.     

 And thirdly, as Kim mentioned a recommendation for an audit.  The  Commonwealth here wouldn’t actually know where the infrastructure priorities  were so far as our economic infrastructure is concerned.  This is also a  significant political rebuff for Mr Anderson.  You’ll recall that a couple of weeks  ago out of the blue Anderson announced effectively a Commonwealth takeover  of State ports and private ports.  There’s now a significant rebuff in all of this for  him, the Prime Minister talking and waxing lyrical about cooperation with the  Premiers.  Well I’m sure the Premiers will be very impressed given that when it  comes to Industrial Relations he wants to have a cooperative conversation with  them about a unitary Industrial Relations system when he announced it on a TV  program on a Sunday morning four months ago.     

 In terms of the actual detail of the recommendations, I’ve made it clear that you  can contemplate separate competitive or regulatory arrangements for exclusively  export infrastructure.  But if you going to do that you need to do that in a sensible  way with the States and with industry and hopefully, if the Government at least  accedes to that recommendation we willl see a start in an area where the  Government has been massively complacent to our economic cost and our long  term productive detriment.     

 JOURNALIST: Do you think (inaudible) was in denial at his press conference  this morning (inaudible)   

 SWAN: Well I think he’s smug and I think he’s complacent.  There are  big challenges ahead, we agree with the Government on that.  It’s just the  Government is not prepared to really invest in the future.  In particular to deal  with the skills crisis in the Australian workforce when you look at the drop in  productivity that is in these figures.  You can see the failure of government policy  when it comes to the whole area of skills and you’ve already heard about the  Government’s failure in infrastructure.  Those two areas alone have been  repeatedly identified by the OECD and the Reserve Bank as areas of reform.   The Government is way behind the ball game here, terribly complacent and  terribly smug.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree though with his interpretation that there is some  encouraging signs of household savings?   

 SWAN: No, I think with is a 50 year projected high in the terms of  trade, 1.9 per cent is something that he ought not to be happy with.  We are  constantly told by the Treasurer that we need to work for growth rates with threes  and fours in front of them, well the Treasurer has a growth rate of 1.9.  If we’re  going to be serious about the long term economic challenges, the aging of our  population, we must seriously embrace economic reform. 

 

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) no infrastructure crisis in Australia?   

 BEAZLEY: No he is wrong.  And it’s not just Kim Beazley or Wayne Swan  or Stephen Smith who says that.  The BCA, the OECD and it’s the Reserve  Bank.  And quite frankly that is a suggestion which shows the complacency and  what we need now is national Leadership.  This particular committee  recommended a certain course which is basically in the direction that we have  been suggesting for some period of time.  The Prime Minister, instead of seizing  it and taking it a point further, seizes it and took a step back.  What the Prime 

 Minister should be doing now is using this report using the fact the Reserve  Bank, the OECD, the BCA and others have said: let’s have some national  Leadership in the development of our infrastructure.  It’s absolutely critical and  the next phase of growth and productivity in this country, the Prime Minister  should say: yes, let’s get on with it.   

 SMITH: Can I just add to that.  The fact that the Prime Minister denies  there’s a problem reflects his and Treasurer Costello’s complacency, that’s the  first point.  Secondly, this is an area where you have lags.  If you do nothing  today, you’ll have infrastructure capacity constraints and bottlenecks in 12  months, two years, three years, five years time.  This is an area where you have  to act now to clear the way for the future.  And this is the fundamental difficulty  that the Government has.  It’s been asleep at the wheel rather than having its  shoulder to the wheel.  This is an area where driving issues through COAG,  having the structures that we recommend like Infrastructure Australia will not only  deal with problems that you find day to day but look down the track to make sure 

 that log jams are cleared away for the future.  The Government’s approach is  essentially do nothing, blame it on the states and the end result of that is after  eleven warnings by the Reserve Bank, an increase in interest rates in March.   

 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Smith, just to be clear, you’ve indicated that broad thrust  in the infrastructure report reflects Labor’s policy ideas which (inaudible)  absolutely clear.  Is Labor completely comfortable with the idea of a single 

 national regulator which is suggested as -   

 SMITH:  The actual recommendation is that COAG consider that  point.  The point I’ve made is this, is two-fold: firstly, I think it is possible, as a  public policy issue, to contemplate a separate regulatory and competitive  arrangement for infrastructure which is exclusively export.  But if you are going to  do that, whether it’s through trying to streamline existing State-based regulation  or have one single regulator or have the triggers which the Taskforce  recommends for national intervention after some State activity, you’ve got to do  that in consultation with the States.  You actually have to have a conversation  with them.     

 Now, while at face value those recommendations would appear to be aimed at  timeliness and resolving these issues more quickly, let’s just be a bit careful here:   the intervention after a six month period of a national regulator might actually  lead to greater delay rather than a more speedy outcome.    

 So I’m quite happy to contemplate the notion of separate or different competitive  or regulatory arrangements for infrastructure which is exclusively export, but what  I’d want to do is what the Prime Minister has finally been dragged to and which  John Anderson was a million miles away from, which is sit down and have a  sensible conversation with the States, the same States that both he and Costello  have been blaming for years were solely responsible for infrastructure.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, I wonder if I could ask you something about  mandatory detention.  Today we saw Treasurer Costello defend mandatory  detention, saying that it was introduced by the previous Labor Government and  seemed to distance himself from Petro Georgiou’s Bill.  Would you say Labor is  closer to Costello or to Georgiou?   

 BEAZLEY:  I think this debate has moved on considerably.  Basically,  what we’re talking about here is not whether there is a mandatory detention  regime establishing the bona fides of people who illegally enter this country, it’s  about what should be the character of that regime, is it going to be a shambles?  

 Currently, it’s a shambles and we can see that not just in the situation for kids  who find themselves behind bars, totally unnecessarily, but also these other  crises that have emerged in determining who is and who is not an Australian 

 citizen and who should be deported.  We’ve got a shambles on our hands, that’s  the issue.  We have said that we are supportive of the directions in which 

 Georgiou’s legislation is going in handling those matters.  We were there a long  time ago.  We have been talking about what’s been happening to kids, we’ve  been talking about the shambolic character of the regime for quite some  considerable period of time.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree (inaudible) that there should be fewer levels of  appeal for asylum seekers and that would free up the system and make the  determinations quicker?   

 BEAZLEY:  One of the sensible suggestions I think we’ve made which is  different from what is there in Mr Georgiou’s Bill is that when after 90 days for  those few that haven’t had their situation determined and the matters concluded  in the regime that we would establish, we suggest an independent committee  should be put in place to review their situation.  It won’t clog up court processes if 

 that is put in place.  We’ve got some suggestions there as to how you can avoid  that situation.  Frankly, what we need out of the Immigration Department is a  much more rapid process of assessment, a much more serious process of  inspection of those who are kept there and a much more independent  assessment of whether or not they’re a threat to absconding and we need the  kids out.  There’s nothing new in any of that.  There’s a fair bit of that in Mr 

 Georgiou’s Bill.  But guess where that all came from?  It all came from a review  that we did two years ago.     

 Whenever Immigration legislation has been coming through the House and on  occasions on Private Members’ Bills in the case of the kids, we’ve been moving  amendments along those lines for some considerable time now.  We are glad  that some of the Liberals are taking that up because you cannot protect your  borders, you cannot defend your country with a shambles.   

 JOURNALIST: Given that context, what was the strategy today in the House  of Representatives in terms of putting Petro Georgiou’s Bill if you’ve got a  legislative agenda that frees children from detention why not introduce your own  bills.  Don’t you run the risk of looking like you’ve got to go to the Liberal  backbench for your ideas?   

 BEAZLEY:  No, I said to the Caucus when I addressed them the other  day that there’s been enough of this Bill kicking around the Press Gallery and not  enough of it kicking around the House, quite frankly.  We’ve had our own bills  there in the past and all the Liberals whom you named voted against those bills  when they were in the Parliament.  This Bill is now circulating around the Gallery,  it’s circulating around the community but it’s not circulating around the House.   It’s time there was a proper discussion in the House.   

 JOURNALIST: Wayne Swan, just back on the (inaudible)  There’s not much  evidence (inaudible) that decision or suggestion that the tax cuts should be  delayed by six months. 

 

 BEAZLEY:  I think there’s plenty of evidence of supply side constraints in  this economy which is putting upward pressure on inflation and therefore upward  pressure on interest rates.  There’s plenty of evidence of that and plenty of  evidence of serious imbalances in the economy, as we saw yesterday, with the  record current account deficit, record foreign debt and the growth in foreign  liabilities so I wouldn’t just isolate the imbalances down to no evidence of inflation  in one particular number.  I think that the Reserve Bank thinks that there are  considerable supply side constraints in the economy.  That’s why we’re seeing  some belated recognition of that by the Government with their report today.  But  there’s a long, long way to go.   

 JOURNALIST: But given those supply side constraints have a long time lag  anyway wouldn’t six months-    

 SWAN:  Well, I think we are living with the failure of the Government  to deal with the supply side constraints as evidenced by the record current  account deficit yesterday and the record foreign debt.  We are living with those  now.  But I wouldn’t be happy with this figure if I was the Treasurer.  I’d be much  more ambitious for my country and I would have a much more urgent approach  to the supply side problems in the economy, notably infrastructure, skills,  Federal-State relations and so on, all matters that he’s terribly complacent about.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, just on another question.  The SAS article in  Time magazine, are you happy with the Government’s response so far about  how far did they go as far as a further inquiry?   

 BEAZLEY:  We’ve actually requested a briefing on that.  I understand  that our Defence spokesman has asked the Government for it and the  Government in the past has always given us a briefing.  I was very saddened by  that story.  I actually visited the SAS when they were in Afghanistan and they had  a reputation - which was drawn to my attention not simply by themselves but by  the American Commander in the field and others - as an enormously sensitive  operator in the region, very loathe to call in air support, very loathe to see  situations develop where there are risks of collateral damage or death for people  who were innocent of any terrorist or Taliban activity.  A number of instances  were drawn to my attention where probably quite a few civilian lives had been  saved by that restraint.  Quite clearly, something went wrong here.  It’s not an  unusual thing that things go wrong like that when you’re in a combat zone and  there’s considerable LETHALITY around.  It seems that in keeping with their  restraint and the significance they gave that, the SAS investigated this and  instituted disciplinary proceedings against some of its members.  We respect the  secrecy with which they operate.  We note the fact that some disciplinary  proceedings resulted from this and we seek a briefing.  But we don’t do so on the  basis that we assume that the SAS have conducted themselves generally in  Afghanistan in a way that risked unnecessarily civilian populations. 

 

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) 1.9 per cent wages growth support the  Government’s argument of the industrial relations reforms?  When will you know  whether and when the disallowance (inaudible)   

 BEAZLEY:  Skills.  That’s exactly what that points to.  The fact that  you’ve got a situation where wages growth seems to be more extensive than the  Government might otherwise have indicated they wanted it to be.  You can go to  any business in this country you’re prepared to name, ask them what they think  the principal problem they have in the labour market, and that is access to skilled  workers.  This didn’t develop yesterday.  This has been developing in the last five  years with this Government’s complacency and concealment, in this instance, as  they basically dropped the ball in the area of traditional trades.  So that is just  one of the statistics that you’re talking about there that I think emphasises the  point that Wayne and myself and in different ways, Stephen too, have been  making for some considerable time now.     

 On the second point, Mr Costello’s trickery concerning disallowable instruments  in relation to the tax system.  Now understand this absolutely: they, on the basis  of consultation with the Tax Office, have complete control about when they put  those things into the House.  He has put it into the House and into the Senate at  a time prior to the consideration of the overall Bill by the Senate, to optimise the 

 focus on that and minimise the focus on the Bill.     

 Now, you’re all Parliamentary correspondents and you’re all capable of  understanding that absolutely thoroughly the tactical issues associated with that.   What we have said is we’re not going to be drawn into that debate by tipping our  hand on it.  We’re going to concentrate on the main game - which is the Bill.  We  are going to attempt to get a fair tax system through the Bill in the Senate.  If we 

 succeed and Mr Costello doesn’t like that, well I hope a few people will be ringing  him up and asking him why he’s blocking a sensible and fair decent tax reform.   

 JOURNALIST: You have been drawn into the debate over the tax schedules  so what are you going to do?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well, no I haven’t been drawn into debate over the tax  schedules; I’ve been extremely successful in not falling into Mr Costello’s zone of  activity as far as that’s concerned.  What Mr Costello needs to have put to him -  and it was briefly put to him for a while by those who take an interest in these  matters - well, why tactically did you pursue it then when you could easily have  done it at a later date and achieved your objectives, given the amount of time you  have for those issues to be voted on?  Now, a few people could have said that to  Mr Costello.  They have not done so.  So what I say to Mr Costello is, ‘we’re not  playing your games.  What we’re about is the Australian people, what we’re  about is the fact that they have not had a fair tax cut offered to them.  You  wouldn’t worry in one sense if all you’re talking about is shifting a few billion 

 dollars around the bottom line of the Government.  But this is $24 billion.  This  constrains, cuts off substantial taxation changes probably for a couple of years.   And yet what do we find when that is concluded?  What we find when that is  concluded is the hardworking people in this country who are building their  families, building our country, working the overtime, trying to get ahead, are given  a derisory tax cut of $6.00.  We’re not going to let Costello off the hook on this.   

 JOURNALIST: Will you have a chance to stop what you see as those unfair  tax cuts and the Treasurer’s given you a chance to stop them by putting this  schedule in a little earlier?  Well, are you going to do that? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  But even better than that, we’re going to give the Treasurer a  chance to be good about it.  We’re going to give the Treasurer a chance to  accept from the Senate, assuming the Senate passes it or if the Senate passes  it, a decent tax arrangement.  He’s going to get a great chance to vote on that  some time in the next two or three weeks if the Senate does the right thing.  We  are not going to back off our struggle for ordinary Australians to get a fair deal out  of what is a once - at least in three or four years - tax cut opportunity.   

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) Government fear that calls for days of protest  against Indonesia and for a boycott of Bali will in fact harm Schapelle Corby’s  cause, rather than help her?   

 BEAZLEY:  I think it’s terribly important that people, in approaching this  issue - and you can understand why everybody’s heart is touched by the  circumstances that have affected Schapelle - is tremendously important to 

 comprehend the right way to approach efforts ultimately, if it’s necessary, to seek  Presidential pardon and, in the interim, to advance her cause or the cause of her  defence team.  Trying to hold the Indonesian people responsible or the people of  Aceh responsible is not the right way to go at all.  I’ve said that before and I’m  happy enough to say it again.  Last question, Misha.   

 JOURNALIST: Just back on the SAS.  I understand the idea of that meeting  was arranged with (inaudible)  Do you think separately to that, that the Australian  public have a right to know if there are breaches of our military code of conduct,  what our soldiers were doing in our name overseas, particularly if they have been  disciplined by a military tribunal?   

 BEAZLEY:  I think in this particular instance they now do know - certainly  it was revealed in the media but it’s also been dealt with by the Chief of the  Defence Force at a committee hearing in the Senate - the circumstances that  arose here are profoundly to be regretted.  I try to weigh it in the balance with  what was an extraordinary effort by the SAS to conduct themselves in a way in a  very difficult set of circumstances, where it’s not easy to separate out people who  are a threat from people who are genuinely innocent and standing to one side.   They made efforts of  truly heroic proportions and I am aware of the detail of one 

 or two actions in that regard which the American Commander mentioned to me,  including one where the SAS chose, rather than use air cover, to manoeuvre its  way out of a trap against a force which outnumbered it by about ten-fold, and in  the course of an hour or so of manoeuvring only expended about 30 or 40  bullets, so concerned were they that they would hit people who were innocent in  that set of manoeuvrings, and while they did it they placed themselves terribly at  risk.  So I’m aware of that action too.  So therefore, before we said anything, I’d  want to get a better briefing on this one.
