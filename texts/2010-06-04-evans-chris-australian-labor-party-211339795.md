 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 New member appointments for Migration Review  Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal  Friday, 4 June 2010 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today announced  the appointment of 43 members to the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). 

 'I am pleased to announce the reappointment of eight full-time and 17 part-time  members and the appointment of eight full-time and 10 part-time members to the  MRT-RRT,' Senator Evans said. 

 'The Government endorsed the selection advisory committee's recommendations  based on the applicants' demonstrated strong sense of fairness and understanding  of the principles of administrative law and their ability to apply these skills in  determining review applications with sound judgement.' 

 Senator Evans said the successful applicants were selected from an extremely  competitive field of more than 300 applicants. 

 'The selection process was totally apolitical and merit-based and I'm confident the  successful applicants bring a wide range of skills and will make a strong contribution  to the tribunals,' Senator Evans said. 

 The selection advisory committee consisted of a Deputy Secretary of the Department  of Immigration and Citizenship, the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC)  Merit Protection Commissioner, the Principal Member of the Tribunals, and the  President of the Refugee Council of Australia as a community representative. 

 Due to the large number of applications, the APSC also nominated Roxanne Kelley,  National Director, Enforcement and Investigations Division, Customs and Border  Protection Service, to assist with the selection process. 

 'The Merit Protection Commissioner's presence on this selection committee  demonstrates an additional clear sign of commitment to a merit-based process  without any political influence,' Senator Evans said. 

 Members have been appointed for five years from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2015.
