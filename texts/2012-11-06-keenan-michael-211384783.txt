 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FIVE BOATS IN A DAY UNDER LABOR’S  HALF HEARTED POLICIES November 06, 2012

 The latest illegal boat is the fifth arrival in 24 hours, the third time this year that five boats have arrived in a single day under Labor’s record failure on our borders, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “The five illegal boats in 24 hours carried more than 230 people, or more than half the number of people that have so far been sent to Nauru under Labor’s half hearted border protection policies,” Mr Morrison said.

 “November  is  beginning  as  August,  September  and  October  ended  - as  a  record  month  for  illegal  boat  arrivals  under  Labor’s half hearted measures and failed resolve on our borders.

 “Less than a week into November there have already been 11 boats with over 600 people on board - more than the entire  capacity of Manus Island which is not even open yet.

 “People  smugglers  have  a  safe  bet  in  Julia  Gillard  and  Chris  Bowen’s  stewardship  of  our  borders  as  they  continue  to   make record profits from record boat arrivals.

 “Only a change of government will remove the stain of Labor’s failure on our borders,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Five boats and 231 people are all less than 24 hours work under this Labor Government.

 “In the past week alone, 13 boats with nearly 700 passengers have arrived on our shores as this unprecedented rate of boat arrivals is increasing.

 “Whilst many Australians would have lost money on the Melbourne Cup today, the people smugglers are guaranteed a sure bet of making millions whilst Labor remains in power.

 “Every illegal boat marks a failure in this Government’s record, and marks another win for the people smugglers. It has become painstakingly clear that Labor’s heart is just not in it when it comes to border protection,” Mr Keenan said.
