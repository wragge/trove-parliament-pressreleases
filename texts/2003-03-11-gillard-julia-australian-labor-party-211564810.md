 Julia Gillard Speech to Sydney Institute Tuesday 11 March 2003 "Winning the Culture War"

 May I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land, the Gadigal people, of the Eora nation. 

 A year ago, the newspapers were filled with the culture war inflamed by Don Watson's 'Rabbit  Syndrome' and Tony Abbott's 'Feeling Better about Australia' speech to the Young Liberals.

 In the ensuing debate, the culture war was boiled down to the 'three Rs" - Reconciliation, Refugees and  the Republic. In the hands of Tony Abbott the 'three Rs' become an acidic jibe against Labor. The  'three Rs' were what Labor stood for and why Labor lacked relevancy. To the amusement of  conservatives and to the electoral cost of Labor, the 'three Rs' were the issues on which Labor had been  wedged between its educated rights focussed constituency and its traditional blue-collar constituency.

 A year later, I address you tonight as Shadow Minister for two of these Rs, or in Labor's terminology  as Shadow Minister for Population, Immigration, Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs.

 Given these responsibilities, I intend tonight to discuss the culture war, in which the three Rs have  become emblematic, and the nature of Labor's and the broader Australian Left's response. In this  context, by Australian Left I mean all those who identify as from liberal left to radical left.

 The Culture War 

 The culture war has been going on since John Howard became Opposition Leader in 1995.

 The culture war has two aims. First, John Howard has sought to maintain power by portraying himself  as the embodiment of the values of ordinary Australians. In doing so he has sought to disguise the  jarring discontinuity between the actions of his Government and Australian values.

 He trumpets his agenda as 'mainstream', when in fact it is the agenda of an extreme conservative  minority. 

 The idea of economic egalitarianism - 'the fair go' - has always been a central, perhaps the central  Australian value. 

 Pulling together to help others has been part of our national psyche from Gallipoli to Changi, and part  of our national institutions from arbitration to the welfare state. Egalitarianism is part of our national 

 culture. It's in our bones.

 John Howard has deliberately set out to undermine it by elevating other values that appeal to him.

 The populist appeals to 'border protection', 'individual responsibility' and 'family values' have been part  of a deliberate strategy to split Labor's 'blue-collar' and 'tertiary-educated' support base - a strategy  modelled on Richard Nixon's 'southern strategy' of the 1960s.

 The second aim of the culture war is square up, pure and simple. John Howard has never forgotten the  wilderness years, the years when he was derided by elements of the media, when he was humiliated by  Labor in government, when he was rejected by his parliamentary colleagues and when he was  consigned by his own 'Lazarus with a triple bypass' crack to the dustbin of history.

 Like all good square ups, John Howard's culture war is fuelled by bile and venom. 

 The tactics are well known:

 · Label anyone who disagrees with you as 'politically correct', undemocratic, part of the 'elite', or  simply 'un-Australian'.

 · Denounce those with alternative views of Australia's identity as 'black armband' historians.

 · Blow the dog whistles of race and xenophobia.

 · Question the legitimacy of certain people running for parliament - like trade union officials or people  from families with a background of political service.

 · Stack public bodies with your friends.

 This is all dressed up in intellectual clothes to lend it respectability, but it's really an attempt to  delegitimize criticism and impose your views on the community.

 John Howard likes to step back and allow his hit men like Tony Abbott to do the public muggings for  him, but the fact is, he's in the culture war up to his neck.

 He's been there from the start, subtly and sometimes unsubtly inciting the culture war on talkback  radio, in public lectures and in neo-conservative magazines like Quadrant.

 In fact, the call to arms to conservative commentators came from the very top. In 1994 the then  Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, John Howard gave his call to arms to his troops (Quadrant,  July-August 1994, p.21):

 "In fighting the battles of history with the Labor Party, the Liberals must remember George Orwell's  proposition: 'Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.'

 There are still far too few Liberals who fully comprehend just how committed Paul Keating and many  in the Labor Party are to the quite ruthless use of history - or more particularly their version of it - as a  political weapon. Not only do they wish to reinterpret Australian history to promote their contemporary 

 political objectives, but they also wish to marginalise the contribution of the conservative-liberal side  of Australian politics and entrench the Labor Party as the only true product of Australia's political soil.

 There are signs of increased Liberal willingness to join battle with the Labor Party over both history  and ideas. This is a trend which must be enthusiastically encouraged."

 And it has been. 

 Howard's spear carriers

 One of the biggest claims of Howard's culture war is that the press is biased towards Labor.

 It's anything but.

 The fact is, whenever anyone criticises Howard from the left they are instantly howled down by his  backers in the tabloids, on talkback and in the opinion page of The Australian. The pure and simple  propaganda produced by Christopher Pearson, Piers Akerman, Andrew Bolt, Les Carlyon, together  with the lunacy of Janet Albrechtsen, combine with the shock jocks John Laws and Alan Jones to  create an environment in which progressive views are lampooned as soon as uttered.

 Like the 2000 Essendon football team, John Howard's right-wing commentators operate on the 'one-percent' theory: chase down every loose ball, make every tackle hard and victory will be yours.

 Their critique goes beyond politics. It takes on every aspect of our culture that could possibly give  succour to an anti-Howard position.

 They've accused filmmaker Philip Noyce of being an anti-American communist fellow traveller and of  stealing Aboriginal children.

 They've forced a politically charged review on our national museum. And one is now trying to do the  same with the national Museum of Victoria.

 They've forced an external complaints unit on the ABC to try to further intimidate its management.

 Despite the overwhelming pro-Howard bias in the commercial media, Howard's supporters are still  unwilling to countenance any attempts at balance. They want total victory.

 In contrast, those in the Australian media who belong to Australia's Left tend to focus criticism on  Labor. There is no Labor equivalent of the consistent advocates of the Howard Government. 

 Alongside the domination and intimidation of Australia's media by the Howard Government there has  been a ruthless stacking of public bodies. Take the following stark examples:

 · "Capital C" conservatives like Ian Callinan and Dyson Heydon have been appointed to the High  Court. 

 · 13 of the 15 Howard appointments to the Industrial Relations Commission have been from employer 

 backgrounds.

 · The ABC Board has been inundated with Howard's hacks. And if Sunday's News Ltd papers are to be  believed, the next board member will be a former Howard speechwriter and bona fide 'right wing  Phillip Adams', Christopher Pearson.

 · In the welfare field, the extremely conservative Major Brian Watters from the Salvation Army was  appointed as Chairman of the Australian National Council on Drugs. A man who believes in zero  tolerance towards alcohol.

 · Merit selection processes were by-passed to allow the appointment of new censors at the Office of  Film and Literature Classification.

 · Conservation bodies like the Australian Heritage Commission, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park  Authority and the Australian Landcare Council are now headed by former Coalition MPs or Coalition  insiders.

 This list could go on and on. It exposes the breathtaking nature of John Howard's attempt to dominate  the centres of decision-making, advice and political criticism in Australia.

 The scope for dissent from Government policy and the definition of acceptable public policy is being  narrowed and, in extreme cases, freedom of political expression itself is under threat. This is bad for  our democracy and it must be challenged.

 Who is winning?

 Last year the editor of Quadrant, P.P. McGuinness, described John Howard's opponents as 'a baying  political lynch mob' and proposed the establishment of a new movement of John Howard supporters  called 'anti-anti-Howardism'.

 While Paddy still nurses a case of acute paranoia, generally the tone of the cheer squad has changed.

 Gone is their claim to be the voice of the underdog, bravely speaking out for unpopular causes against  the smelly little orthodoxies that poison our public life.

 Populist right-wing ressentiment is so twentieth-century.

 It's been replaced by a tone of triumphalism. 

 Since the beginning of this year Les Murray, Christopher Pearson and others have been acknowledging  that they're now on top. The paradigm has changed. They're the new orthodoxy.

 Peter Ryan writing in The Australian on January 10 probably put it best:

 '…the minority rule of trendoid ratbaggery is ending, and we are returning our attention to less exciting  matters, such as national survival in an envious and hostile region, and to the everyday sort of Australia  that most people truly want… This has not been done by the unaided effort of John Winston Howard,  yet somehow one can't imagine it happening without him… After years of venomous bias, the media 

 are now changing their tone. Even journalists can see that Howard's political ascendancy is total…  Fifty years from now, when impartial history can be written, and the archives can be unlocked, the two  decades straddling the millennium will be known as the Age of Howard.'

 My message today is that it's time for those who oppose Howard's agenda to admit that he and his  helpers have succeeded spectacularly.

 The nation is in the grip of a neo-conservative political correctness that is out of touch with the values  of the majority of the Australian people. 

 It's a political correctness that has elevated values that most Australians don't share: individual  selfishness and a strange envy of the less fortunate because they are receiving government assistance. 

 It's a political correctness that has produced greater divisions in our society between the haves and the  have nots, indigenous and non-indigenous, new migrants and old.

 And it is a political correctness that puts winning before all else, where ethics, integrity and values like  equality and looking after others less fortunate don't rate.

 John Howard has won his culture war, for now. 

 My argument is that it's time for Australians of all political persuasions who don't like this new  political correctness - from Green on the left, to small-L liberal on the right - to wake up to the fact that  they have lost the culture war. 

 Australia has been changed… for the worse… by John Howard. 

 We can make it better again.

 The War with Iraq

 Tonight of all nights, we can feel the importance of charting a different course, a different course from  John Howard's neo-conservative political correctness and from John Howard's drive for war.

 Nothing could show more starkly the differences between the political parties capable of governing  than the biggest issue this nation faces tonight, the looming war with Iraq.

 John Howard has consistently treated national security as a cost-free forum for domestic politics. This  year we've seen this reduced not so much to absurdity as to banality, with the rash of 'Sunday stories'  leaked from the Government. 

 So the national anti-terrorism mailout became a Sunday story, previewed on the Sunday papers and  running as a lead on Sunday night news.

 Then there was the announcement of the John Howard doctrine of regional military pre-emption on the  'Sunday' show, courtesy of Laurie Oakes.

 And most recently the expulsion of the Iraqi spy is reported - you guessed it - on a Sunday.

 I mean if you're going to kick out a spy, you wouldn't want to miss the news cycle, would you. 

 Labor has consistently supported the United Nations in its attempts to disarm Saddam peacefully. John  Howard, by contrast, has been the sycophantic echo of the American President as he pushes for war at  all costs. 

 Labor opposed the forward deployment of our troops. John Howard's Government sent them.

 Labor opposes the 'Son of Star Wars'. The Howard Government backs it.

 And the Liberals' failed former leader, Alexander Downer, has been cheap enough to use the prospect  of war, of large numbers of men, women and children dying, as a new battering ram in the culture war  with his labelling of Labor as 'appeasers' and Simon Crean 'as talking like Saddam Hussein'.

 As we have dealt with the Iraq debate, too often those opposed to war have succumbed to Labor being  the target. To do so is to fall into the trap of allowing the differences of opinion between progressive  people to become the issue rather than the appalling agenda of the John Howard and his conservative  chorus. 

 I understand the position of those who advocate 'no war' though I do not agree with it. In the world in  which we live the body that deals with conflict and disarmament is the United Nations. I know that the  United Nations has its flaws, indeed to deny that would be risible, but the United Nations is the only  mechanism that the world has to deal with conflict and to make peace. In my view, it is right to back it.

 For those not convinced by this argument I simply say, who should be the target of your anger - John  Howard who stands shoulder to shoulder with George Bush or Simon Crean and the Labor Party who  have supported the United Nations from the days of Doc Evatt?

 Time to win the culture war

 It's time Howard's values were exposed and his Government driven from office. This will require unity  on the part of all those who despair over where the Coalition is leading the country.

 I want to make an appeal to those commentators and everyday Australians who are worried about the  direction in which our nation is heading.

 Many Australians opposed to John Howard's agenda have been reluctant to support Labor, because  they have disagreed with our stance on a number of issues. 

 Despite the fact that Labor won 49 percent of the two-party preferred vote at the last election, it's hard  to find supporters of ours in the newspapers or on the airwaves. 

 I'm prepared to acknowledge that Labor bears some of the blame for the disillusionment among our  traditional supporters.

 But building a progressive majority requires us all to admit that there are potential tensions between  Labor's 'blue collar' and 'tertiary-educated' constituencies. 

 That's not new. 

 I recently read an interview in which Simon Crean was asked about how Labor could resolve the  tension between what the interviewer called 'middle-class trendies' and 'working-class conservatives'.  How could Labor possibly hope to build a national majority on these twin constituencies? Wasn't this a  fundamental contradiction in its voting base?

 The interview was recorded by the ABC in 1979.

 It should have been clear for at least the last 25 years that these two constituencies must hang together  or be hanged separately. The centre and left must build an agenda that offers a win to both.

 It's time for everyone to the left of John Howard to put our differences aside, meet half way and  recognize that the only way to defeat John Howard's reactionary agenda is to reunite all those who care  about preserving Australia as a tolerant, outward-looking and egalitarian country. 

 The answer to a swing to the extreme right is not to swing to the extreme left.

 History shows that this approach is doomed to failure.

 Just look at the experiences of the British Labour Party and the Democratic Party in the U.S. in the  1980s. In 1983 British Labour swung hard to the left and won 29 percent of the vote. Under Mondale  the Democrats won only one state.

 Progressive forces must build a majority coalition. Let's learn this lesson the easy way - from history -  rather than the hard way - another victory for Howard.

 Labor can't govern from the extreme left in the way the Howard Government can from the extreme  right by exploiting prejudice and fear.

 In short, I'm saying that the Australian Left must give up taking the easy shot against Labor and shape  up, dare I say muscle up, for the hard task of winning the culture war and creating a new vision for this  nation.

 I want people to come back to Labor.

 The fact is we are the only party capable of defeating Howard and gaining a majority in the House of  Representatives. 

 You can't get rid of Howard if you keep relentlessly attacking Labor.

 'Teaching Labor a lesson' and constantly claiming we're opportunists only plays into Howard's hands.

 The new vision

 It would be too simplistic to ascribe left disillusionment with Labor as arising because of an individual  policy position. This phenomenon is global and has been best described by Michael Jacobs, the 

 Secretary of the British Fabian Society. He writes:

 Until at least the mid-1980s most members of the Labour party, in common with its sister parties  throughout Europe, believed in a different kind of social and economic order, with institutions and  social relationships founded on morally superior values. This was socialism, and belief in it infused the  whole of left-of-centre politics. 

 Socialism was not merely the end-point towards which those on the left believed themselves to be  working. For large numbers of activists and politicians, it was an animating force in their lives. People  were socialists in the way that others (sometimes the same people) were Catholics or Jews: it was part  of their identity. 'Socialist' did not just describe a set of views you had. It was something you were.

 Michael Jacobs then contends that British Labour needs to find a new animating force, which he  rightly describes in the following terms:

 Radical idealism does not require a belief that modern economies and societies could be run under  fundamentally different principles, merely that the present system could be made to generate  fundamentally different outcomes. For its root is a very simple impulse. It is the feeling that many  people must surely have when looking at the world: that too much in the present order is morally  wrong. A billion people living in absolute poverty, species and habitats being wiped out, many groups  subject to systematic violence and discrimination, some people consuming vast amounts while others  starve. The impulse is not complex, nor does it carry self-evident prescriptions. It simply says: the  world does not need to be like this.

 These words should resonate with the Australian Left. It does not need to be like this - triumphalism by  the conservatives as the progressives turn on each other.

 We need to find and define the new animating force. Our failure to do so is one of the reasons that we  are losing the culture war. In the face of a conservative onslaught, Labor and the Australian Left have  not been able to articulate an answering guiding philosophy. As a result, those on the left of centre  have turned inwards, preferring to fight with each other over individual issues, preferring the assumed  'purity' of criticising Labor, preferring self-righteous disillusionment over working together to find the  new vision.

 Even worse, we have let the conservatives define the agenda on which we will fight each other. It was  the conservatives who selected the 'three Rs'. And having selected them, the conservatives have  laughed all the way to electoral success as those in the Australian Left have set about destroying each  other over whether you are pro-refugee enough, whether you are or aren't a minimalist Republican,  whether you agree or disagree with the statements of Noel Pearson on indigenous welfare dependency.

 There is no real future for progressive politics if all we do is fight each other on the issues defined by  the conservatives. There is no real future for progressive politics if the definition of what it is to be Left  is to be solely defined by a series of disconnected causes.

 If we are to address the deep malaise so correctly identified by Michael Jacobs then it is time to put the  work in to defining what he refers to as 'today's transformative ideal'. 

 The transformative ideal needs to be founded on a fundamentally global perspective. Progressive  people throughout the world now know intuitively that addressing global inequality and finding a new 

 way for global conflict resolution requires a new vision of global architecture and relationships. This is  the positive side of the anti-globalisation street movement and has the potential to harvest the  community goodwill that exists around issues like the Third World debt campaign.

 The transformative ideal also needs to have a view about democratisation and empowerment. Within  the context of liberal democracy we need to build a vision of what can be done to find a new way of  including individuals and communities within decision making, a new way of renewing the bonds  between us. The transformative ideal also needs to have an ethical component, a set of values about  how we are to treat and respect each other. 

 The transformative ideal also needs to challenge current economic power structures. Even within the  context of a market economy there is so much more that can and should be done to share and to  empower.

 Labor is starting to shape this new transformative ideal in this period of Opposition by developing a  vision for the Australia over the next 20 years. It is time to show that in modern politics you can get  people to lift their eyes from the next three years to the next 20.

 The challenge for progressives within the ALP and beyond is to work out how they will contribute to  defining the new transformative ideal and the new Labor vision for Australia. The challenge for  progressives is to understand that the agenda of the three Rs needs to be sited within a broader vision  of Australia, which is inclusive of those who rightly worry about jobs, health, education, roads, border  security and the like.

 And in relation to the three Rs, some may want more than the position Labor adopts, but it's time to  admit that a Labor agenda with the capacity to speak to both our tertiary-educated and blue-collar  constituencies is far preferable to a continuation of Howard's culture war against the Australian values  of equality and tolerance.

 Conclusion

 Labor can use government to build a future for Australia, where the now much derided elites can be  proud of our independence, our reconciliation with our indigenous peoples, our diversity and tolerance  and our leadership of global and regional debates at the same time that all Australians enjoy economic  growth, an improving environment, better infrastructure, world class health services and real  educational opportunity. No one needs to be left behind.

 But we do need to leave behind the lack of unity and lack of purpose that has characterised the  Australian Left's response to the culture war. 

 I'm issuing a call to arms to the centre and the left.

 It's time to put aside our differences. Stop running down Labor's standing. And realise - to use a clichÃ©  much abused by John Howard - that what unites us is stronger than what divides us. 

 And by working together we can build a future based on the values of fairness and tolerance that  survive in the hearts of the great majority of Australians.
