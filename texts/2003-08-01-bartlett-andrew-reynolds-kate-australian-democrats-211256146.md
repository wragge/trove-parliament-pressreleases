 Ruling welcome but children must be released   

 

 The Australian Democrats welcome today’s Family Court ruling that a prima facie case exists that  the detention of five children in South Australia is unlawful.   

 Democrats’ Leader and Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the ruling has the  potential to be extremely significant for future cases regarding child detainees.   

 “This ruling vindicates the stance of the Democrats and refugee support groups that the welfare of  children is completely incompatible with ongoing detention,” said Senator Bartlett.   

 “The Democrats hope this decision leads to the freeing of all children in detention and a rethink  from the Federal Government of its whole detention policy.   

 “No policy that causes major damage to children can be justified in any circumstances regardless of  what other aims the policy may have achieved,” said Senator Bartlett.   

 South Australian MLC Kate Reynolds said today’s decision puts pressure on the State Government  to support the other applications to be heard by the Family Court next week for families to be  released.
