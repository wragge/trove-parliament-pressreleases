 NSW migrant settlement steady 

 New South Wales remains the most popular destination for migrants to settle, despite an  increasing number of new arrivals choosing to live in other states.   

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said 44 661 migrants  settled in NSW in 2005-2006 both in city and regional areas, just 85 fewer people than in the  previous year. 

 ‘Sydney has a long history of attracting migrants because of employment opportunities, family  links and the existence of well established migrant communities within the city,’ Senator  Vanstone said. 

 ‘A network of support services has now been established in regional NSW and throughout  Australia and this has made it more attractive for migrants to live and work away from the big  metropolitan centres of Sydney and Melbourne.’ 

 China was the state’s largest source of migrants with 5296, while 4561 arrived from the United  Kingdom, 4615 from India, 1017 from Sudan and 1550 from Iraq. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’     

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
