 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 CHILDREN IN DETENTION - IT’S A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE

 Support for Labor’s amendment to get children out from behind the razor wire of immigration detention by Australians for Just Refugee Programs is welcome.  I specifically welcome the endorsement of Labor’s stance by one of the group’s patrons, Dr John Yu, former Australian of the Year.

 The amendment I have moved to the Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill seeks to modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that children cannot be held in high security detention for long periods of time.  This amendment will compel the Government to:

 â¢ Put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements; and â¢ Allow families with children to live in accommodation like the Woomera alternate detention trial.

 Dr Yu also called for a conscience vote on Labor’s amendment when it is debated in the Parliament next month.  In relation to a conscience vote, it is worth highlighting (again) that on 26 August this year I asked the Minister, given he was free to cross the floor in 1988 to vote with the then Labor Government to endorse a non-discriminatory immigration policy for Australia, to assure Coalition MPs that they will be similarly free to cross the floor this time and support Labor’s amendment.

 The Minister failed to answer the question.  However, I am calling on Government members to be guided not by the Minister’s words, but by his actions in 1988, and by their consciences. It’s time to get children out from behind the razor wire.
