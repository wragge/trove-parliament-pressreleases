 PRESS RELEASE FROM MICK YOUNG, SHADOW MINISTER FOR  IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 DEPORTATION OF "REFUGEES"

 On behalf of the Opposition I have no hesitation to say that 

 the Government had no alternative but to take the measures 

 that it has taken regarding illegal "refugees" arriving to 

 our shores.

 Some people may argue that the 146 people could have easily 

 been settled in Australia. But the Australian Government must 

 maintain controls over our immigration rules and this can only 

 be achieved following the will of the Australian people.

 We can't have people just arriving to our doorsteps and expect 

 to be accepted. Hopefully after this tragic incident people 

 overseas will get the message that one cannot just arrive to 

 our shores.

 Hundreds of thousands of people were settled in this country 

 since the 2nd World War. Although we talked a lot about the 

 abolishment of the "white Australia" policy it is only the 

 last 5 years that something has been done about it.

 I believe that people who want to come to Australia must 

 join the queue.  It is sad that innocent people are sometimes 

 exploited by unscrupulous persons.

 Canberra 

 20 October 1981
