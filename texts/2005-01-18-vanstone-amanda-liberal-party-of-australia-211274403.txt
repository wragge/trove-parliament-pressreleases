 Australia Welcomes African Refugees to their New Home

 VPS 020/2005

 Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said she was pleased to welcome  a group of 376 Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees, who arrive in Australia today from desperate situations in Africa. 

 ‘On behalf of all Australians, I welcome this group to their new home and future,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 Senator Vanstone said most of this group had lived in refugee camps since the 1990s and many of the children had been in  camps for their entire life. 

 ‘The experiences they have had to endure means they need the support of the Australian Government and all Australians to  ensure their transition to their new lives is a success,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Australians can be proud of our generous spirit and the many programs we have in place to help these refugees to become  self-sufficient and participate in the community as quickly as possible,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Our Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy includes links to essential services such as Centrelink, Medicare and  banking as well as accommodation support, help in establishing a household and health and psychological services.’

 These refugees are among the 13,000 people who arrive each year in Australia under our Refugee and Humanitarian Program.
