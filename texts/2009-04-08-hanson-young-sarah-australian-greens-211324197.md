 Australia must respect legal right to seek  asylum   

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has issued a reminder that it is not illegal to  seek asylum, and has urged the Federal Government to treat asylum seekers  humanely and with compassion by processing any claims on the Australian  mainland.   

 Three boats carrying suspected asylum seekers have arrived on or have been taken  to Christmas Island in the past week.   

 “It is not illegal to seek asylum in Australia,” said Senator Hanson-Young.   

 “Any talk of ‘illegal immigrants’ arriving in our waters is inappropriate.   

 “Instability and deteriorating conditions in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri  Lanka mean that more asylum seekers are seeking assistance and protection from  countries like Australia.”   

 Senator Hanson-Young urged the Federal Government and its Immigration  Department to follow through with its rhetoric of a more humane, compassionate  approach.   

 “Immigration Minister Chris Evans must lead the charge in enshrining the Rudd  Government’s immigration principles in law, by introducing legislation to this effect.   

 “The Greens also call on Minister Evans to close the Christmas Island detention  facilities, and bring all asylum seekers to the Australian mainland to have their health  and identity checks carried out and claims processed.   

 “We currently have a two-tiered system for asylum seekers, where those who arrive  by boat suffer from an ‘out-of-sight, out-of-mind’ treatment by the Australian  authorities.   

 “There should be no distinction between those who arrive by boat, and those who  seek Australia’s assistance from offshore.”
