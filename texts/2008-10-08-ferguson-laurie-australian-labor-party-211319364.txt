 Laurie Ferguson MP  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services 

 Assistance for refugees with special needs 

 Wednesday 8 October 2008 

 Refugees who have been victims of violence and torture will be among those who  receive additional support with the rollout of the Complex Case Support (CCS)  program, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services, Laurie Ferguson, said today. 

 The program, which began nationally on October 1, will assist recently arrived  refugees and other humanitarian entrants in difficult and unique circumstances  where their needs cannot be adequately addressed by existing services. The service  will assist particularly vulnerable people to help build a life in Australia. 

 ‘The CCS is an holistic case management approach to assist clients in crisis. Clients  may need assistance with crisis intervention, and to be linked to specialist services  including respite care and mental health treatment along with drug, alcohol and  family counseling. The program will also include social services for children and  youth,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 In 2007-08, Australia granted 13 014 visas under its refugee and humanitarian  program. 

 ‘A small number of these people experience extreme difficulties soon after arriving in  Australia, often as a result of pre-migration experiences such as torture and trauma  or crisis events after arrival. These difficulties can present significant barriers to their  successful settlement,’ the parliamentary secretary said.     

 ‘Many of these people need resource intensive intervention and the CCS program is  designed to provide additional support services and specialised case management  where the needs of people are beyond the scope of current services.’ 

 A panel of service providers, known as the humanitarian services panel, has been  established to deliver specialised and intensive case management services on a  needs basis to refugees in crisis. 

 ‘Members of the panel are experienced in delivering services to refugees. The role of  CCS service providers is vital in helping this particularly vulnerable group of people  settle successfully into the Australian community,’ Mr Ferguson said.    

 CCS services have been implemented through a staged roll-out that began in 

 August. The service will complement and build the capacity of the existing suite of  settlement services.
