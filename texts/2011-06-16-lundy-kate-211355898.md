 Senator Kate Lundy  Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 

 $3.5m to Enhance Settlement Services in the  West  Thursday, 16 June 2011 

 Joint Media Release with Senator Kate Lundy -  Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs and Chris Bowen MP - Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and  Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs,  Senator Kate Lundy, today announced that $3.5 million would be allocated to  Western Australian agencies under the Settlement Grants Program (SGP) to help  refugees and migrants settle into their new communities. 

 As part of the grants program funding allocated to Western Australia this coming  financial year, the Government will provide $145 000 to Mercy Community Services  to deliver a range of projects including its Rental Ready Course, which helps newly  arrived migrants and refugees successfully navigate the highly competitive local  property rental market. 

 'The Rental Ready Course is a truly innovative and worthy project that delivers  intensive accommodation training to people as part of a joint initiative by Mercy  Community Services, in partnership with the Tenants Advice Service and the  Northern Suburbs Community Legal Centre,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'More than a quarter of the concerns faced by people using Mercy's services last  year related to accommodation, particularly issues around documentation and rent. 

 'This course, with industry support, is already showing it is helping to alleviate  problems faced by migrants and refugees in a competitive housing market by  providing information and practical training on issues including tenancy training and  domestic cleaning.' 

 In the 2011-12 financial year, the settlement grants program will provide  $2.71 million to fund 20 new projects that will help new arrivals settle in Western  Australia. Funding is also provided for a number of successful projects continued  from previous financial years. 

 Some of the successful applicant organisations include migrant resource centres,  multicultural service agencies and community and welfare organisations. 

 'The many projects supported by the settlement grants program will help migrants  and refugees to settle successfully into their new communities, promoting social  participation and assisting in their cultural transition into Australia,' Senator Lundy  said. 

 'I commend all organisations for their contribution to the successful settlement of  migrants and refugees in Western Australia.' 

 A complete list of successful applicants in the 2011-12 funding round is available on  the Department of Immigration website.  See: Settlement Grants Program
