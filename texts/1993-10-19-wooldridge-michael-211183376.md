 Media Release

 Deputy Leader of the OppositionShadow Minister for Education, Employment and TrainingMichael Wooldridge COAU11ON STANDS UP FOR STUDENTS

 The Coalition will not support the Government's HECS changes as it believes them to be overly harsh - - - -and unfair.

 We call on the Australian Democrats to join with us to ensure changes are made to this legislation.

 The Government's proposal to raise HECS to 1.5 times the standard rate for students who take longer than the minimum course time to complete their course is too harsh.

 The Government's measures ignore these important facts:

 that disadvantaged students, including non-English speaking students, may take longer to complete their courses

 it is unfair to penalise students when some course structures have pre-requisites that prolong courses up to 12 months

 it is an administrative nightmare to increase HECS after only six months, especially when University records would have to be searched back to 1989 because of course changes and amalgamations.

 The Coalition intends to make this part of the proposed legislation fairer so that students have one year, instead of six months, added to their standard course time before they are liable for the increased HECS charge of 1.5 times.

 The Government proposal to double the standard rate of HECS for students doing a second degree, whether the first degree was completed inside or outside Australia, is also too harsh and unfair.

 To apply this increased charge to students who completed their initial 'degreeoutside Australia, at no cost to the Australian taxpayer, is grossly unfair and especially if their degree is not recognised . here. :-These Government proposals highlight the °raise revenue at any cost'- -rnentalityof the Government. _ - -They are insensitive to different situations of students.-.: .. . ...â¢

 The Coalition will seek to refer to the Senate Standing Committee this part of the bill to ensure that -there will be adequate hardship arrangements in place to protect those (especially refugees) whose _ qualifications are not recognised here.

 Students feel betrayed and we will stand up for them to ensure they get a fair deal.
