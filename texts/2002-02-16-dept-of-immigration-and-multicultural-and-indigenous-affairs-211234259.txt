  62 Sri Lankans Transferred to Christmas Island

  16/02/02

  

   A group of 62 Sri Lankan asylum seekers were transferred from Cocos 
Island detention facility to Christmas Island detention facility on 
Saturday, 16 February 2002.

  

   Their departure follows the tran sfer of 180 asylum seekers 
from Christmas Island to processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru 
in late January.

  

  These transfers will provide detainees on both Christmas 
and Cocos Islands with more flexible living arrangements.

  

  The departure of the group means there are 31 detainees 
remaining on Cocos Island and 88 detainees remaining on Christmas Island.
