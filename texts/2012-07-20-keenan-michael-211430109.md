 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Coalition welcomes new military medal for  our hardworking Border Protection  personnel July 20, 2012

 The Coalition welcomes the decision to honour our defence personnel involved in the battle against people smuggling and  illegal fishing with the new Australian Operational Service medal, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “The hardworking men and women of our Border Protection Command (BPC) work under tireless and tough conditions,  sometimes placing their lives and health at risk to rescue others and protect Australia’s borders.

 “This overdue recognition comes at a time when BPC personnel are facing an incredibly strenuous working environment  with this constant stream of boat arrivals flooding across Australia’s borders.

 “It is vital that we recognise the bravery shown by our BPC, especially in light of the recent tragic events - where lives  were lost but also many were saved thanks to the courage of our border protection personnel.

 “The events surrounding the rescue of many of those onboard SIEV 221 which crashed at Christmas Island is worthy of  particular attention.

 “I congratulate the hundreds of men and women who will receive the medal in the coming months - the Coalition  appreciates the great work you do in protecting Australia’s borders,” Mr Keenan said.
