 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Monday, 19 January 2015    

 Greens call for independent team of mediators to be sent to Manus Island    

 The Australian Greens are today calling for an independent team of mediators to be sent to the  Manus Island detention centre immediately.     

 "It is clear that all trust has broken down between asylum seekers and staff in the centre and  that a new approach is desperately needed”, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.     

 "Things on the island are only getting worse. Refugees are continuing to self harm in an act of  desperation.     

 "We need a circuit breaker in order to calm the situation. That is why I am calling on the  government to send an independent team of mediators into the centre immediately.     

 "The job of this team will be to listen to asylum seekers and come up with a humane outcome  which is in everyone’s interests.     

 "I fear for the lives of those detained inside the centre and plead with them not to harm  themselves.     

 "The refugees inside the camp are clearly distressed and broken. They need empathy and  compassion not simply "tough talk" from the Minister.
