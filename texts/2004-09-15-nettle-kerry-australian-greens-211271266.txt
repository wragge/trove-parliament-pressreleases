 Greens announce major investment in regional  services   

 Senator Nettle, 15th September 2004 

 The Australian Greens today announced a major investment in essential regional  public services, reform of national water management and a more humane policy for  refugees. NSW Greens Senator Kerry Nettle and Greens Victoria Senate candidate  David Risstrom released The Greens regional and rural policy initiatives in Albury-Wodonga.  

 "The Greens would arrest the decline of government funding for essential public  services in regional and rural Australia," said Senator Nettle.  

 "The Greens would spend the $25.2 billion (four-year) budget surplus on services  including health, education, housing and infrastructure, not on tax cut bribes." 

 "The Greens would reverse the funding decline suffered by our regional universities.  We would offer regional universities a loading to account for the extra costs those  universities face in order to supply a full range of high quality courses," said Senator  Nettle. 

 "We would also ensure that where regional students are forced to relocate, Austudy  and Youth Allowance payments incorporate a relocation payment to meet these  students' needs." 

 The Greens also announced their support for reform of water management. 

 "If our river systems break down, everybody loses," said Mr Risstrom. "The Greens  want to go back to basics to avert the crisis and work with all stakeholders to: improve  the efficiency of water use; wind back the over-allocation of water entitlements and  legislate minimum environment flows to restore the health of rivers." 

 "We want to provide 3,000gl of extra flows to the Murray Darling, with at least  1,500gl over the next 5 years." 

 "The Greens also know that country people want a fair go for refugees," said Mr  Risstrom. "The Greens would end mandatory detention and grant refugees on 'Safe  Haven' visas, including the Kosovars, permanent residency on humanitarian visas." 

 Other Greens initiatives are to: 

 * Provide an additional $6.025 billion for public schools  

 * Give regional universities a loading to offset relative funding cuts 

 * Keep Telstra public and ensure reliable access to broadband internet services 

 * Invest $4 billion over the next ten years to upgrade rail infrastructure
