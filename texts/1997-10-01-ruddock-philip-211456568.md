  Funding boost for ACT settlement services  "The Government has demonstrated its commitment to regional Australia with community grants  commencing today to organisations which serve people outside the major metropolitan areas" the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

  The successful Australian Capital Territory organisations who help migrants and humanitarian  entrants to settle in Australia, were announced by the Minister on 28 August as a $404 650 package of  awards under the Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme* and the Integrated Humanitarian  Settlement Strategy. 

  "The funding is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to helping migrants and refugees  settle quickly into their new community," said Mr Ruddock. 

  "The new grant arrangements focus on meeting community needs while at the same time ensuring the  Government and community receive value for money." 

  Mr Ruddock said the Australian Capital Territory had received 14 awards which included funding for  five projects. 

  Organisations funded included the Migrant Resource Centre of Canberra and Queanbeyan, Woden  Community Service Inc, Belconnen Community Service Inc, Belconnen Community  Services /Vietnamese Association and the Croatian Community Welfare Centre Inc. 

  "This package of funding reflects the Government's commitment to providing services which help  migrants and humanitarian entrants settle in their new country and quickly become contributing  members of our community," said Mr Ruddock.
