 PRIME MINISTER

 FOR MEDIA 13 MARCH 1987

 I am pleased to announce the establishment of the Advisory   Council on Multicultural Affairs which will report to me and   to Mr Young as Minister Assisting me on Multicultural   Affairs.

 The Council will be chaired by the Honourable Sir James   Gobbo of the Victorian Supreme Court. Sir James has been a   leading figure over many years in the development of   multiculturalism and has served governments and community  

 groups in many capacities, and I am delighted that he has   agreed to accept this new and important post.

 His Deputy will be Mr George Wojak who also has a long   history of service to the community on multicultural   matters, and is currently the President of the Federation of   Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia.

 The Council includes members from each State and Territory,   men and women from a diversity of backgrounds, who between   them possess both extensive experience and youthful   enthusiasm and represent a wide variety of expertise and  

 generational viewpoints.

 The Advisory Council will be charged with providing advice   to me and to Mr Young on ways in which the Government might   advance its objective of encouraging the further development   of our multicultural society. In recognition of the   cultural diversity of contemporary Australian society, the   Government seeks to promote an environment in which all   Australians, irrespective of cultural origins, can exercise  

 their rights and obligations as full and equal members of   the community.

 As part of this, the Advisory Council will also be expected   to help the Government to ensure that its policies and   programs are equitable, and its programs accessible to all   members of our community.

 The Council's role will be a broad one. It is expected that  priority will be given to developing advice for the  Government based on consultation and research.  The Council  will provide an appropriate channel for communications 

 between the community at large and the Government on  multicultural matters. It will also be responsible for  assisting the Government in promoting multi culturalism  across all sectors of the Australian community.

 The Council will be supported in these roles by an Office of   Multicultural Affairs which is being established in my  Department. Three senior appointments have now been made to   the Office. The Head of the Office will be Dr Peter 

 Shergold, formerly an Associate Professor in the Department  of Economic History at the University of New South Wales,   who has had wide research experience in the multicultural  field and has worked closely with community bodies and 

 government agencies in conducting that research. He will be   supported by Ms Vasiliki Nihas and Mr Peter Vaughan. Ms  Nihas,  who has also had extensive research and working  experience in multicultural affairs and especially in the 

 education field,  will be responsible for consultation and  liaison with communities.  Mr Vaughan, who has had long  experience in administering government programs in a   regional setting and for developing policy advice for  governments,  will be responsible for the advisory and 

 research roles in the Office.

 The role of the Office will be to support the Advisory  Council and the Government in developing policies which are  equitable and which contribute to the maintenance of social  harmony. It will work closely with the Advisory Council.

 The Office will consult widely with commtinities and other  Government agencies in developing and carrying out its role.

 The Advisory Council is expected to meet quarterly -  although, as already indicated, its members will also be  involved between meetings in the preparation of information  and advice on particular subjects.

 The first meeting of the Advisory Council will be held in  Canberra next month. Subsequent meetings are expected to be  held in other cities.

 Mr Young and I look forward very much to working closely  with Sir James Gobbo, Mr Wojak and other Council members. The Council collectively has a very broad range of  backgrounds and expertise and should be well placed to help 

 the Government advance the cause of multicultural!sm.
