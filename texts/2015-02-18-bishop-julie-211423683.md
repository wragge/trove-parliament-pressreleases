 The Australian Greens   

 Media Release  17 February 2015   

 No justice one year after refugee Reza Berati's tragic death   

 Tuesday marks one year since the tragic death of Reza Berati, a refugee in the care of the Australian  Government.   

 "A year on and we still have no answers and a government that refuses to accept any responsibility for  the death of a refugee in its care," Greens Leader Christine Milne said.   

 "People imprisoned on Manus Island continue to suffer but Reza Berati paid the ultimate price for the  Coalition's cruel policy encapsulated  in the election slogan to 'stop the boats'.   

 "One year after Reza Berati's death, the Abbott government continues to shame the nation by acting in  breach of human rights international law and common human decency."   

 Greens immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson Young said:    

 "The government’s culture of cover-up and secrecy means there has been no justice for the Barati  family.   

 “The situation on Manus is as toxic as it has ever been and no amount of government denial will change  that.   

 “It’s time the media were allowed into the Manus Island camp so that the Australian people can finally  see what is being done in their names,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 The Greens have renewed calls for the government to urgently accept the recommendations of the  Senate Inquiry into the tragic events of February 2014.
