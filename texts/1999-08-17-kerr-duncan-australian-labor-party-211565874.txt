  MEDIA RELEASE

  The Hon Duncan Kerr MP

  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

  Shadow Minister for the Arts

  

 17 August 1999

  

  New Boat Seized on Christmas Island to be blown 
up

  

  “The Justice and Customs Minister, Senator Vanstone, must make clear 
the fate o f the boat seized carrying 142 illegal arrivals and 
held at Christmas Island before any action is taken,” Shadow Minister 
for Justice and Customs, Duncan Kerr, said today.

  

 “Sources on Christmas Island are expecting orders 
from Canberra authorising the destruction of the vessel.

  

 “While it is an option under the Customs Act, destruction 
is usually resorted to when the vessel is worthless.

  

 “In this case, it is reported that the vessel is 
quite new and may be worth retaining and perhaps gifting to a volunteer 
organisation to be brought up to standard and used in the service of 
the community.

  

 “It seems the Government can do with all the help 
it can get. Perhaps a volunteer coastwatch operation may be able to 
convert the vessel and put it to good use.”
