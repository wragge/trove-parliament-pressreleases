 DEMOCRATS CALL ON LABOR TO PROTECT WELFARE RECIPIENTS The Australian Democrats have called on Labor to commit to protecting welfare recipients and to supporting the ACOSS call for a significant financial investment in welfare reform.

 “Labor must commit to preventing the Government making life tougher for welfare recipients,” said Democrats’ welfare spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett.

 “The Government’s welfare reform proposals may make life tougher for single parents or disability pensioners. Will Labor join the Democrats to prevent that or will they just whinge about it and still let the legislation through?

 “Lately Labor has been saying one thing but doing another, in regard to schools funding and refugee policies, for example,” Senator Bartlett said.

 Senator Bartlett was responding to the release today by ACOSS of its May Federal Budget priorities in which it called for an investment in welfare reform by Government to stop the gap between rich and poor from widening.

 “The Democrats support the ACOSS call for economic investment to directly benefit people in poverty and we hope Labor will do the same,” said Senator Bartlett.

 In November last year Wayne Swan, Labor spokesperson for Social Security, told the Melbourne Institute Welfare Reform conference that Labor did not get the investment in welfare reform right. Wayne Swan admitted that Labor had not pursued both economic and social reform when in office.

 “Labor is relying on rhetoric and indecisive policies on welfare reform.

 Strong submissions such as that put forward by ACOSS are in danger of lapsing,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “The Democrats suspect that the Government will baulk at the cost of welfare reform measures and instead focus only on the punitive provisions in the McClure report such as toughening up conditions for sole parents and disability support pensioners.

 “With Labor’s refusal to commit to strong economic and social investment, we are concerned that submissions such as that put forward by ACOSS will disappear without the necessary support by the major parties.

 “Australia can break the welfare cycle if we set the right policies. As ACOSS has rightly concluded, it will cost a lot of money in the short-run but the long term savings would make it well worth the effort,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
