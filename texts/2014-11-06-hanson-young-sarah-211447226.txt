 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 6 November 2014   

 Manus murder investigation compromised   

 Allegations that refugees are being pressured into changing witness statements in relation to the  murder of Reza Barati are extremely serious and must be investigated, the Australian Greens have  said.   

 “The Minister has flatly refuted these allegations, but he has been caught lying before when it comes  to Manus Island,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Julian Burnside has raised important allegations and the Minister has refused to take them  seriously.   

 “An obsession with cover-up and blame shifting means this Minister’s credibility is shot. When it  comes to integrity, I know who I’ll back between Scott Morrison and the Sydney Peace Prize  recipient Julian Burnside.   

 “Reports of coercion tactics being used to change witness statements on Manus have been  circulating for some time. Clearly something very sinister is happening inside the Manus Island camp  and, clearly, the Immigration Minister wants it kept hidden.”
