  MEDIA RELEASE

  

  Senator Andrew Bartlett

  Australian Democrats Immigration Spokesperson

  

  16 JUNE 1999 99/314

  

  Last chance to comment on Refugee Program

  

  

  Submissions close tomorrow (Friday 18 June) to the parliamentary inquiry 
into the refugee program, prop osed by the Australian Democrats.

  

 The Democrats’ spokesperson for immigration, Senator 
Andrew Bartlett is urging interested groups and individuals to put their 
views to the inquiry.

  

 “A submission can be as simple as a one page letter. 
Everyone’s views are relevant and the terms of reference are quite 
broad,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

 “Housing and detention facilities, appeal mechanisms 
on decisions, legal aid, temporary haven, deportation practices and 
the size of the refugee program which is about 12,000 places a year, 
are just some of the areas which could be looked at,” said Senator 
Bartlett

  

 The inquiry will examine a number of individual cases 
including the Chinese woman, who was allegedly deported and forced to 
have an abortion at 8¼ months upon her return to China.

  

 Submissions can be faxed to the Senate Committee on 
(02) 6277 5794 or emailed to   legcon.sen@aph.gov.au . The inquiry, to be conducted by the 
Legal and Constitutional References Committee, will report by the 18 
October 1999. A limited number of public hearings will also be held 
around Australia before the Committee reports.

  

 “The Democrats are keeping an open mind on the outcome, 
but we believe that widespread concerns about the operation of the refugee 
program must be properly examined. The Democrats want any flaws in the 
system ironed out,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

  For interview contact Senator Andrew Bartlett 
on 0418 743 789 or (02) 6277 3406
