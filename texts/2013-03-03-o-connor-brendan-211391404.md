 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Sunday, 3 March 2013   

 Opposition continues kneejerk asylum seeker claims   

 The Opposition today continued its demonisation of asylum seekers, even as it conceded its plan to  set up a notification register of asylum seekers in the community was unworkable.   

 When pressed on the Insiders program this morning about how the register would work, the Shadow  Minister claimed notification would apply only when asylum seekers were being placed in  government-organised accommodation alongside shared facilities such as university campuses and  aged care homes.   

 Yet last Wednesday, his press release said there should be:   

 ·         A requirement for neighbouring residents to be alerted in advance of boat arrivals being  located in their community on bridging visas or community detention   

 The Shadow Minister had no answer to the question of how neighbours should be notified of asylum  seekers on bridging visas moving into private rental accommodation.   

 He also had no answer to why neighbours should be notified, other than his apparent assumption  that people seeking asylum somehow pose a threat to the general community.   

 If the Liberals cannot maintain a policy position for longer than four days in opposition, how would  they be able to implement the policies needed to deter people from making perilous journeys on  unseaworthy vessels to seek asylum in Australia?    

 The Shadow Minister claims to support the policies of the Howard Government, which included  releasing people into the community on Temporary Protection Visas, yet he says this Government  should not release people into the community on bridging visas.   

 He also has no answer to how the Opposition would pay for its new policy of keeping all asylum  seekers in detention, which is much more expensive that allowing them to live in the community.
