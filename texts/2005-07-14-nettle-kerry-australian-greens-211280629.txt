 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Palmer Report recipe for business as usual. 

 14th Jul 2005 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle reacted to the release today of Mick  Palmers report into the detention of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez  by labelling it as "a recipe for business as usual."   

 "Mr Palmers report offers a bureaucratic solution to a policy problem.  As a result it is doomed to fall short of the publics' demand that our  immigration policy is made compassionate and humane," Senator  Nettle said.   

 "There are no recommendations that recognise that unlimited  mandatory detention is often the cause and always an aggravating  factor of detainees' mental illness.   

 "No amount of improved training and improved bureaucratic systems  will prevent this mental illness whilst people continue to be locked up  indefinitely in desert prisons like Baxter.   

 "The Department's new head is steeped in the same cultural approach  to immigration detention and compliance that has caused this litany of  abuses. Even if he pursues all of Mr Palmer's recommendations there  will still be a fundamentally uncompassionate and inhumane system in  place.   

 "The failure of the Minister to accept responsibility for the widespread  failure of her department smacks of arrogance.   

 "Today's report leaves much of the abuses of the immigration  detention policy of this government unexamined and the need for a  royal commission remains urgent. 

 

 "We must remember that this report does not deal with the forgotten  people on Nauru who continue to languish in limbo as a result of this  government's ongoing lack of compassion toward asylum seekers.   

 The tabling of the report today comes in response to a motion by  Senator Nettle to require the report to be tabled in full which was  supported by the Senate last month.   

 "The Greens support a return to a policy which allows all asylum  seekers to have their claims assessed whilst they live in the  community after standard health and security checks are completed."
