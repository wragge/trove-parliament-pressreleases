  Minister in Tasmania for    
immigration consultations

  

  MPS 18/99 

 The Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today said initiatives to 
attract more skilled migrants to regional Australia were having a significant 
impact in Tasmania. 

 In Launceston at the 
start of a national program of consultations on Australia's 1999-2000 
migration program, Mr Ruddock said the number of migrants coming to 
Tasmania under the Skilled stream increased by more than 20% in 1997-98 
compared to the previous year. 

 "The 1997-98   Settler Arrivals  
statistical report, which I am launching in Tasmania today, shows that 
66 people migrated to the state through the Skilled stream last year, 
up from 52 in 1996-97. In total, some 369 migrants settled in Tasmania 
in 1997-98 compared to 431 the previous year. 

 "Tasmania's figures 
reflect the emphasis that the Government has placed on attracting skilled 
migrants, and our determination to deliver a balanced program. 

 "Australia is getting 
the expertise it needs, and the community can be confident the migration 
program is generating significantly more benefits for them. 

 "The Government 
is committed to ensuring that skilled migration to regional Australia 
continues to improve, so all Australians can share in these benefits". 

 Some 30.6% of all permanent 
settlers to Tasmania entered under the Family Stream, down from 44.8% 
last year. 

 The Humanitarian Program 
accounted for 29.3% of arrivals in Tasmania, up on the 19.0% of last 
year, while the Non-Program migration category (mainly New Zealand citizens) 
attracted 22.2% of settlers, slightly down on last year's figure of 
23.9%. 

 Among the new settlers 
to Tasmania, were people from New Zealand (14.4%), the United Kingdom 
(12.7%), Bosnia-Herzegovina (11.1%), Croatia (6.0%) and the USA (4.9%). 

 Mr Ruddock said during 
this year's consultations he will meet with a wide cross-section of 
individuals and organisations including representatives of business, 
economic, industry, union, environment, welfare, planning, refugee, 
humanitarian and ethnic community groups. 

 "This is the first 
time that a nation-wide round of public meetings has been held on the 
migration program. 

 "I trust this will 
provide a unique opportunity for many Australians to contribute their 
thoughts, ideas and comments on the size and composition of Australia's 
immigration program". 

 Consultations and public 
meetings will also be held in Melbourne, Albury-Wodonga, Griffith, Sydney 
Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Brisbane, Cairns and Darwin.
