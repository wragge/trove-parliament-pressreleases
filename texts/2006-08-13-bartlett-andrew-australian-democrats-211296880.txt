 Vanstone Ignores The Facts in Effort to Sell Refugee Law Change

 Immigration Minister, Amanda Vanstone, is ignoring the facts by continuing to claim that no asylum  seekers were forced back to Afghanistan from Nauru.   

 "I can attest from personal experience, as well as from the testimony of many refugees who were  detained there, that the pressure on the Afghanis to return was constant and relentless," Senator Bartlett  said.   

 "Neither the Minister, nor any other Senator went to Nauru to inspect what the conditions were like or to  see for themselves how asylum seekers were treated. They are in no position to comment accurately on  what the situation is actually like there."   

 "Many of the asylum seekers were basically presented with a 'choice' of indefinite detention followed by  forced removal, or taking $2000 now and taking their chances."   

 "To call such a 'choice' voluntary is simply dishonest."   

 "The evidence to the very brief Senate Inquiry into the legislation provided ample, documented evidence  of extremely sloppy decision making and a far greater prospect of cases being rejected, particularly with  children."   

 "This legislation also has nothing to do with Border Protection."   

 "Every single asylum seeker actively seeks to be found and is assessed more closely than any of the  other four million people that enter Australia each year."   

 "This issue is too important for people to be misled by lies and misleading rhetoric," concluded Senator  Bartlett.
