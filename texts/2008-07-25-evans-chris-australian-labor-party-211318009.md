 Australian aid for international humanitarian  projects 

 Friday 25 July 2008 

 The Rudd 

 Government has approved $6.45 million for international aid  projects to help housands of people who have fled war,  persecution or political strife in their troubled homelands. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Evans, said the funding will contribute to humanitarian projects  assisting displaced persons in Iraq, Syria, Nepal, Bangladesh,  Thailand, Africa and Pakistan. 

 The funding is provided under the Australian Government’s  Displaced Persons Program for projects administered by the  International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations  Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Austcare.    

 In Syria, $553 000 will go towards a UNHCR project supporting  Iraqi women and girls who are victims of sexual or gender-based  violence. It includes funding for a safe house where victims will  receive counselling, support and other assistance in the case of  emergencies. 

 ‘Of  particular  concern  are reports  of women  and girls  forced to  resort to  prostitution 

 The Australian Government funds agencies such as the  International Organization for Migration to deliver essential  household supplies to populations in need through the  Displaced Persons Program.

 or being  involved in  other forms  of  exploitation  in order to  survive,’  Senator  Evans said.  

 ‘The  funding  from the  Australian 

 Government will help more than 1000 vulnerable Iraqi women and  girls who otherwise have no source of income.’ 

 The UNHCR in Bangladesh will receive $950 000 to construct 180  shelters which will house 1000 Rohingya families who have fled  neighbouring Burma.  

 More than 26 000 Rohingya are currently living in two refugee  camps in Bangladesh and these new shelters will help improve  their basic living conditions until more permanent solutions are  found. 

 A UNICEF project in Thailand will receive nearly $1 million to  strengthen child protection services for children living in the nine  refugee camps and villages situated along the Thai-Burma border. 

 ‘The project focuses on protecting vulnerable children from abuse,  exploitation and violence as well as helping to prevent them from  becoming the targets of people smuggling and trafficking  activities,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘In  particular,  there are  concerns  that refugee  children are  forcibly  recruited  into the  non-state  fighting  forces in  Burma.’ 

 Other 

 humanitarian assistance projects receiving Australian funding 

 The International Organization for Migration delivers  building supplies for the construction of protection shelters  to displaced families through the Australian Government-funded Displaced Persons Program. 

 Organisations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund  are funded through the Australian Government’s Displaced  Persons Program to transport and distribute essential  supplies such as food and relief materials.

  z Provision of protection officers to help in conflict-affected 

  displacement situations in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.   z Situational assessment, rehabilitation assistance as well as 

  delivering urgent humanitarian assistance and protection for  displaced Iraqis both within Iraq and neighbouring countries.   z Assisting in the long-term development of comprehensive 

  and durable solutions for the management of the registered  Afghan population in Pakistan.   z Providing Bhutanese refugees in camps in Nepal with 

  international protection and humanitarian assistance,  especially in the areas of refugee legal aid and protection,  health and nutrition services, and education.  

  Senator  Evans said  the  Australian 

  Government will commit more than $16 million to the Displaced  Persons Program in 2008-09, including a special fund for one year  of $10 million for projects specifically to assist displaced Iraqis.  

  The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is currently  considering project strategies and proposals. 

  ‘Australia’s funding will help provide effective protection to people  displaced by conflict, especially those who are vulnerable to being  targeted by people smugglers and traffickers,’ Senator Evans said. 

  ‘It continues our commitment to assisting people suffering from  long-term displacement, particularly those in our region.’ 

  Senator Evans said the Displaced Persons Program underlined  Australia’s commitment to assisting people in need. 

  The Rudd Government has increased Australia’s refugee and  humanitarian intake for 2008-09 to 13 500, with one-off increase of  500 places for Iraqi refugees. In addition to this, further 600 places  were set aside in 2007-08 for Iraqis who worked with Australian  forces, and their families.
