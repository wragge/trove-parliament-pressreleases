 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Education Policy, Ansett Airlines, Refugees

 Transcript - Sydney, NSW - 8 September 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: In setting up the National Public Education Alliance of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Labor leaders, and Labor parties, we are putting public education on the agenda for us, in this election campaign, at the same level we have assigned public hospitals with our Medicare Alliance. These are the crying needs in our community. Governments must stop walking away from their responsibilities. Federal Governments must stop walking away from their responsibilities in these areas. John Howard has said, 'all you see is all you get'. He is no longer interested in public health and public education. We say they are the core issues of Australian politics.

 JOURNALIST: The big question seems to be, how much money?

 BEAZLEY: Yes, and it's a reasonable question. We've already pointed out some of the shifts that we intend in that regard and how we'd fund them. We, of course, like the Government, are awaiting the Charter of Budget Honesty report on what the real state of the surplus is. But we challenge the Government - end the phoney war - reveal the true state of the surplus now so can both put out fully tested policies, fully funded policies, and have those policies tested with a decent, long debate in the electorate. That's what we want. And it's in the Government's gift to do it.

 JOURNALIST: If it turns out to be billions, what percentage….education?

 BEAZLEY: Well, if it turns out to be greater, and they are using that money to spend on what will be, to my mind, at the end of the day, a limited value tax cut, all the more for us to invest in the nation's future in education and in the nation's security in aged care and public hospitals.

 JOURNALIST: Can you put a figure on…I mean, Bob Brown has put $200 billion on your promises today.

 BEAZLEY: Well, Bob Brown wouldn't know. Bob is, of course, a nice, but expected opponent of the Labor Party. As the Greens Leader, he would say that. The fact of the matter is that we are the ones who have to accept responsibility for Government. We are the ones who have to do everything we do within the constraints of what a Budget will permit.

 But priorities in the end win out. And if your priorities are for the public education system and the public hospital system, and you work at that over time, you shift substantially the amounts that are spent on them and governments can do those things.

 I have the benefit of having been 13 years a Labor Party Minister. And I can see the value of long-term targets and long-term planning and systematic commitment to achieving those goals. I can say this: given two terms of Labor Government, the education position of Australia would be transformed - absolutely transformed - for a simple reason. We believe it. In the end, politicians do what they believe even more than they do what they promise.

 My life in politics revolves around creating the conditions for Australian survival. The conditions for Australian survival and prosperity are intimately bound up in our education, training and innovative performance. Without it, we're down. With it, we're up there competing with the best.

 JOURNALIST: …what makes your solution so unique?

 BEAZLEY: I think we've got a unique opportunity now. It won't happen forever in Australian politics. But we do seem to have two conditions prevailing - a large number of Labor State Governments, and a large number of Labor Premiers, and potential Prime Ministers, who like each other. These things don't necessarily go together. And these things historically have never occurred before. And we all agree.

 One of the things I think is terrific now is to watch Steve Bracks, Bob Carr and Peter Beattie compete -not on who is going to get the Grand Prix, but on who is going to get the Synchrotron. This is different. This is new in Australian politics. This is putting knowledge, education and innovation at the centre of an Australian political agenda, not an after thought for a Prime Ministerial cancelled visit to Silicon Valley in California.

 JOURNALIST: So, would you try to match the amount spent by Sweden in their GDP on knowledge?

 BEAZLEY: The targets we've set in education go to completion rates at high school. And that would involve a very substantial lift in completion rates, and that would involve very substantial extra resources, there's no doubt about that, in order to be able to achieve those completion rates. On innovation we've set a target of doubling the current Australian performance. That's a target that we've set ourselves. So, we measure ourselves in that regard. I think that if we achieve those two things, you would see those percentages that I mentioned in the course of my speech adjust dramatically.

 JOURNALIST: Should the Government delve into its budget surplus to bail out Ansett?

 BEAZLEY: You've always got to be cautious about where you spend your resources. Where I'm critical of the Government is in the state of knowledge that they've had about Ansett's difficulties for some time. They have not dealt with it urgently. They have effectively allowed drift to come to a point where there are 16,000 jobs at risk, regional airline services at risk and competition in the Australian airline system at risk. It's been rumoured in the press. There's been analysis, pleas for help and all the rest of it for the best part of nine months now. And constant assurances from Anderson that everything is really all right, everything is really handleable. Now it appears it is not. There may need to be some taxpayers' resources devoted to this. There may need to be. How much? Well, I'm not in a position to know. But I do know this: something has to be put together which keeps Ansett operating and those jobs… Now the Government has not lived up to its responsibilities in that regard. The time has come for them to do that.

 JOURNALIST: Would a Labor Government allow greater foreign ownership to help shore up, say, an Ansett that's struggling?

 BEAZLEY: We think that there is a role to play for Singapore Airlines here. The exact character of that role is, of course, a matter that's got to be determined. But, suffice it to say, that if people had reached finality of that some months ago, you'd have been in a much better position in relation to bargaining with Singapore Airlines than they are now.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 BEAZLEY: Well, I've already given my priorities on a rescue package for Ansett. What I want to see is a solution which ensures that there is a competitive environment in Australia, regional services and Australians at work. That's what I want to see in a solution.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the issue of illegal boat people should be brought up at CHOGM next month?

 BEAZLEY: The Government is not serious about dealing with this problem. We have just seen the evidence of that. We had the Three Amigos turn up in Jakarta and fail comprehensively. Understand this, Howard understands this, though he doesn't like to explain it to the Australian people, if we are going to establish any degree of control over numbers of people coming here, the critical point of decision and action is in Indonesia. That's the simple fact of the matter. Howard can't deliver because he has treated them so shabbily over the course of the last couple of weeks - shabbily. Instead of acting like a Prime Minister, when had a problem on his hands, and going first to source to Indonesia, he instead conducted his discussions with Indonesia over a megaphone over talkback radio. He fought, if you don't mind my saying, like an Opposition Leader, not a Prime Minister. And he effectively ran against Indonesia in the talkback process. And he now expects - and sends three senior Ministers up. Never has there been such a humiliating rejection of a higher-powered Australian delegation to any country than we've seen in this. Now, what we say in the Labor Party is this: I am a man who believes in the immigration program. I believe that the immigration program should not be undermined, that the immigration program should operate properly. I believe the solution to that lies in two areas. Firstly, getting the relationship right with Indonesia so that Indonesia feels a sense of confidence that the refugees they have will be properly assessed and dispersed to other countries, and that we are prepared to play a part in that process by taking some. In return, of course, we return people who illegally arrive here. Now, that requires a high order of diplomacy. It requires a degree of systematic attention to the problem that this Government has not been able to give. We will give it.

 And the second thing, surveillance requires affordable year round surveillance. We are already hearing the whisperings in the Navy that they do not like to be burdened with what they are doing. Navies are high order capable military implements. They are required to exercise at a maximise level of capability to ensure that should a war break out, they can destroy our enemies. They are not policemen. What we require for surveillance and action is not a naval presence out there, but a coastguard presence out there -a different order of activity.

 Those are the Labor Party's two solutions. The difference between Howard and us is we don't operate on a megaphone. We operate like a government. He operates like an opposition - and he's been found out.
