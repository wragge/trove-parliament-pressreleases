 PRESS RELEASE

 I notice that the Prime Minister and Minister Hand yesterday had  difficulties in answering the question "how many Chinese students  in Australia on the 4th June 19 89 had overstayed their student  visa"?

 I was surprised as this should be so, particularly as much of the  material was available and published. Attached is a copy of an  answer given by Senator Robert Ray as Minister for Immigration,  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on the 21st November 1989 

 last, on the question of overstay rates of English Language  Students from the People's Republic of China.

 In fact, Senator Ray stated that since the 1st January 1986  15,111 PRC Students arrived in Australia while 1,685 had left.

 It seems, to me indefensible to produce a policy which purports to  be made on the basis of fact, if information impacting upon that  decision and publicly available was not in the hands of the  Minister or Prime Minister when decisions were taken.

 To assist in establishing a complete picture of student numbers  and the processing of their claims, I also attach a copy of a  separate question to the Minister and the response of Minister 

 Holding dated the 28th November 1989.

 For further comment contact Philip Ruddock in his Parliament  House office on (06) 277 4343 or 4342.

 L  Answers to Questions

 (1) Under the terms o f the domestic terminal  jfcscs, which took effect from 1 January 1988, An-  sAt and Australian Airlines were granted leases for  a SO year term with provision for an extension of  arofind 10 years subject to certain specified condt- 

 tionSi

 ThesAleascs supersede the previous agreements which  generally gave Ansett and Australian Airlines exclu­ sive rignts to their terminals until 1993, well beyond  the star! o f deregulation on 31 October 1990.

 The Government recognised that the success of der­ egulation w ould depend on the ability o f new en­ trants to \gain access to airport facilities. The  Government therefore took the initiative, and de­ cided in th a  absence o f other available facilities to  renegotiate ike leases held by Ansett and Australian  Airlines, witlft a view to allowing other operators  access to terminal facilities after deregulation.

 Copies o f the la m in a l leases have been made avail­ able to potemialNnew entrants on request.

 (2) Leases have been agreed with Ansett and  Australian Airlinesvtt the following Airports; Sydney,  Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Coo-  langatta and Launceston.

 (3) Yes, under the terms o f the terminal leases,  Ansett and Australian Airlines are required to pro­ vide new entrants with a full range o f passenger  processing facilities, including access to baggage Check­ in and handling facilities passenger assembly areas,  acrobridges, where appropriate, and aircraft parking  positions.

 The leases require Ansett and Australian Airlines to  provide facilities at Sydney arid Melbourne to handle  I wo passenger aircraft each\ at any one time. A t  Adelaide, Perth and CoolanStta, facilities for the  handling o f one passenger aircraft by both Ansett  and Australian Airlines are to Be provided. Ansett is  required to provide facilities at uaunceston to handle  one passenger aircraft. At Brisbane, the Federal A  im­ ports Corporation (F A C ) has alternative accommo­ dation that can be made available to new entrants.  At Hobart, new entrants can be accommodated in  the international terminal.

 Use of facilities by new entrants w ill\be on either a  dedicated sub-lease or common use ba^is, depending  upon the needs o f new entrants.

 The process to allocate terminal facilities to new  entrants w ill commence by 1 January 1990, when  Ansett and Australian Airlines must advisfe the FAC  of the facilities that they arc to make available.

 On | February 1990, the Secretary to theyDepart-  ment of Transport and Communications w ill arrange  for public notice to be given o f new entrant facilities  available at airports and call for applications for  their use.

 On 1  March 1990, these applications w ill be opined  m .the presence o f Ansett and Australian Airlines  representatives by the Secretary and the facilities wjU  °e allocated on a priority order

 21 November 1989 S E N A TE  2969

 Highest Priority—regular interstate public air  transport services commencing after 30 October  1990

 Second fciighest—regular intrastate public air transport services commencing after 30 October 1990

 Third H ighest\ncw  interstate public air transport services commencing between 1 January 1988 and 1 February 1990 \  ‘

 Lowest Priority—passenger charter operations.

 I f  there are more applicants of an equal priority  than available space, the\determination as to who  w ill have priority will be made by the Minister for  Transport and Communications in the public inter­ est.

 (4) It is not possible to determine the specific 

 number o f new entrants that tnh terminal leases  provide for as the arrangements contain considerable  flexibility for new entrants.

 The renegotiated terminal leases are designed to pro­ vide new entrants with a minimum leveKof access  following deregulation. It is open to theXFAC to 

 provide for the longer term needs o f new entrants  by "the FAC constructing additional facilities \ r  al­ lowing new entrants to develop their own.

 In this regard, the FAC is discussing with potential  new entrants their requirements following dercguia\  tion.

 Chinese Students (Question No. -1254)

 Senator Vallentine asked the Minister for  Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, upon notice, on 6 October 1989:

 (1) Given that the Government has recently in ­ troduced a new policy governing the entry o f Chinese  students to Australia for the purpose of studying  English, and that this new policy was introduced to  curb an alleged overstay problem among Chinese  students, can the Minister explain whether these new  restrictions on entry have been formulated on the  basis o f proved overstay patterns of Chinese, for 

 instance has it been established that Chinese students  over 35 years of age have a greater propensity to  overstay than do those under 35.

 (2) I f  the new regulations are not based cm ob­ jective evidence of overstay patterns, can the Minis­ ter explain how they were determined. _

 (3) Would it not be preferable to delay introduc­ tion o f retrospective regulations until some objective  criteria can be established.

 (4) Would it not in fact be preferable to improve the efficiency of compliance and deportation proce­ dures. '

 Senator Robert Ray— The answer to the  honourable senator’s question is as follows;, ( l )  The new policy governing the entry o f appli­ cants wishing to undertake non-formal study courses

 2970. SEN ATE 21 November 1989

 o f less than 12 months duration and EL1COS (Eng­ lish Language Intensive Courses for Overseas $tu-<  dents) has been introduced to curb a real overstay  problem. The overstay rate for students from all  countries in these programs is 23.3 per cent. (In 

 1988/89 21,483 persons were issued visas to under­ take ELICOS.) By way of contrast, the overstay rate  for visitors is 1.8 per cent and over 1.3 million visas  w ere issued in 1988/89 under this program.

 The overstay rate at the end o f May 1989 for  students from the People's Republic o f China (PRC)  was 40 per cent. Since I January 1986, 15,111 PRC  students have arrived in Australia and up to the end  o f May 1989 only 1,685 (or 11.2 per cent) had left 

 Australia.

 The Government's new measures were introduced  to address the overstay problem as well as the “ pipe­ line" of 25.000 applications lodged with the Embassy  in Beijing. T lu “ pipeline" processing measures are  less stringent than the global measures (which will  apply to PRC applicants from 1 January 1990) in  that "pipeline" applicants w ill be assessed against a  lower education level criterion (year 10 compared  w ith year 12 for the global measures) and w ill not  be subject to more extensive immigration bona fides  testing (required under the global measures). Im m i­ gration bona fides tests are applied to assess the  applicant against the stated purpose or reason for  wanting to come to Australia and likely compliance  with the entry conditions (ie the applicant w ill leave  Australia at the expiry of the entry permit).

 The under 35 years of age stipulation is an edu­ cation rather than immigration criterion. In general  terms, it is expected that by age 35 people will have  undertaken the education offered by the ELICOS  program. There are exceptions to this and the G ov­ ernment has recognised these in framing the meas­ ures to apply to the "pipeline" processing.

 (2) The new measures arc based on objective  evidence of overstay patterns.

 (3) Not applicable. Objective criteria have been  established and further delay in implementation would  worsen an already intolerable situation.

 (4) It is more efficient and considerably less costly  to apply immigration checks prior to visa issue. The  statistics referred to in (1) above illustrate the effi­ ciency of immigration bona fides testing—the visitor  program is subject to immigration bona fides testing,  the ELICOS program has not been. Compliance  activity in Australia plays a role but it is very expen­ sive. The average cost (excluding court costs) asso­ ciated with locating and deporting a prohibited non  citizen is $9,000.

 Part of the new measures introduced to address  the student overstay problem is the introduction o f .  an application fee of $130. Monies raised by this fee  w ill offset the cost o f location and removal o f stu­ dent overstayers.

 I  Answers to Questions

 \  Genetic Engineering

 \  (Question No. 1261) '

 Senator Jones asked the Minister repre­ senting the Minister for Administrative Serv­ ices, upon notice, on 10.October 1989: · (1) W ith regard to a report in the A ustralian o f

 13 September 1989 headed “ Strict genetic engineer­ ing conboU demanded", does this refer to a report  o f the Law, Reform Commission of Victoria, tabled  in the Parliament o f that State the previous day, 

 which claimed some types o f work associated with  genetic engineering contained significant or unknown  risks. \

 (2) In view o f claims that voluntary notifications  o f such work are. the only current requirement, are  any measures contemplated to impose greater con­ trols on genetic experiments, coupled with compul­ sory notifications lo u n y  supervisory body.

 Senator Roberr. Ray— The Minister for  Administrative Services has provided the fol­ lowing answer to the honourable senator’s  question: \

 (1) Yes. \

 (2) While notification ol\proposed genetic manip­ ulation work to the G enetiaM anipulalion Advisory  Committee (G M A C ), and Compliance with their  guidelines and advice, is non-Statutory, a number o f 

 legal constraints apply to this kind o f work and  sanctions are available for nCn-compliance with  G M AC's advice. These are canvassed in the report  of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria referred  to in the Senator's question. \

 Consideration o f the adequacy ofpresent controls  on innovative genetic manipulation^technologies is  one o f the functions o f the Group Î¬ Î¯ Officials on  Biotechnology Regulations (GOBR). This group con­ sists o f officers from the Departments \> f Industry,  Technology and Commerce, Community services and 

 Health, Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tdurism and  Territories, Primary Industries and EnergyXand Ad­ ministrative Services. GOBR is the responsibility o f  Senator the Hon. John Button, Minister for Industry, 

 Technology and Commerce, \

 The Minister for Science, Customs and Small ^Busi­ ness, the Hon. Barry Jones MP, recently proposed  an investigation by the Parliamentary CommiiteesXon  Environment Recreation and the Arts, Industry  Technology and Commerce, and Legal and Constv 

 tutional Affairs, of the ethical legal and environment  tal problems associated with genetic engineering. T h e '  question o f controls for genetic manipulation w ill be  addressed in the light o f advice from these groups.

 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

 FOP. C-.CUIATION TO:—

 (Question No 2 0 8 3  )

 Mr Ruddock asked the Minister representing the Minister for  Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon  notice,  on 5 October 1989:

 (1) When did nationals of the People's Republic of China  (PRC) begin to arrive in Australia as students of  tertiary institutions and special English colleges.

 (2) How many such students are currently in Australia.

 (3) What percentage of the students are enrolled in (a)  tertiary courses and (b )  English courses.

 (4) Is the Minister able to provide figures showing the  proportional distribution of PRC nationals in the  States and Territories in (a) tertiary institutions and  (b) special English colleges.

 (5) What are the minimum qualifications of PRC nationals  enrolled in (a) tertiary institutions and (b) special  English colleges.

 (6) What (a) is the maximum period PRC nationals are  allowed to stay in Australia and (b) criteria,  including financial evidence,  must be satisfied for  entry.

 (7) Is it a fact that the Minister's Department did not, or  does not,  have sufficient application forms for refugee  status or for permanent residency. \ . 

 (8) Is it a fact that where there is a shortage of such  forms,  the Minister's Department will accept as valid  photocopied forms.

 (9) Is it a fact that the Minister's Department will accept  completed application forms from all PRC nationals but  will not consider them until 1990.

 (10) What instructions have been given to the Departmental  counter staff in relation to advising PRC nationals.

 (11) Does the Minister's Department encourage PRC nationals  illegally in Australia to come forward and apply for  work permits as well as lodge applications for refugee  status and/or permanent residency.

 2

 (12) What guarantees does the Minister's Department provide  to PRC nationals illegally in Australia in terms of not  deporting them once their whereabouts are revealed in  their applications.  .

 Mr Holding - the Minister for Immigration, Local Government  and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answers to the  honourable member's questions:

 (1) PRC students, particularly home Government sponsored ,  students have been entitled to study in Australia since  the early 1900s. In 1986 the Department of Employment,  Education and Training assumed the non-visa issuing 

 functions related to overseas students and, with the  introduction of the full fee program in 1987 coinciding  with the PRC Government's decision to relax exit  â¢  arrangements for PRC nationals,  large numbers of PRC

 students have arrived in Australia to undertake a large  range of full fee courses including ELICOS, business  and special studies courses and university courses.

 (2) As at 30 June 1989 there were 12,973 PRC students in  Australia

 Subsidised 1121

 Full fee (formal) 528

 Full fee (non-formal) 11324

 ,  12973 '

 (3a) 12.7% (1649) are enrolled in tertiary courses.

 (3b) 87.3% (11324) are enrolled in non-formal courses. The  majority of these are enrolled in English courses.

 (4) No.

 (5a) PRC students seeking to undertake formal studies (university, CAE, secondary or TAPE)  are not subject to  the new entry criteria' and need only satisfy the  institution's minimum academic requirements.

 (5b) The following new minimum requirements for students from  the PRC seeking to -undertake ELICOS were announced by  the Government on 30 August 1989:

 .  year 12 equivalent .  maximum age 35 years (some exemptions may apply) .  certification that course will be relevant to  current or future employment or provisional 

 acceptance into a further course.

 3

 (6a) PRC students entering for a course exceeding one academic year are authorised to stay in Australia until  15 March of the year following the first year's study;  if the course is for one academic year or less (eg  ELICOS), the authorised stay is limited to the duration of the course plus one month. ‘ - ‘ ' - 0 ·

 (6b) In general, PRC students entering Australia must satisfy the following requirements, which are imposed by  the Department of Employment, Education,and Training:

 .  .  .  they intend to enroll as full-time students in an approved course of study or training

 .  satisfy the English language requirements for the â    proposed level of study or training where  applicable .  .

 .  have the financial capacity to meet all the costs  of "  their study or training and stay in Australia  (including that of dependants if any), including  living costs, return fares and the overseas  students charge, where applicable

 .  meet health and character requirements, where  applicable.

 Additionally, PRC students seeking to undertake  non-formal short courses (of less than 12 months  duration) including ELICOS must meet the requirements  outlined in (5) above and satisfy the following 

 Department of Employment, Education and Training -  criteria:

 .  enrolment in a minimum six months course (which  .  can be less duration if proceeding to '

 .  trade/vocational)

 .  a signed acknowledgement, that no dependants would  be permitted to join the applicant in Australia.

 (7) Due to unprecedented demand for such application forms  stocks were inadequate in some regional offices.  Additional forms were printed without delay and  sufficient forms are now in all of the Department's  offices.

 (8) Photo-copies of the forms are acceptable.

 4

 (9) All applications will be accepted from PRC nationals.  Because of the large numbers involved the Government  has yet to determine how best to process the  applications. When this decision is taken the  applications will be considered. Some applications .   have been finalised.  These are cases where 

 circumstances demanded consideration.

 (10) My Department's.instruction number PC 1601 of . 4 July 1989 sets out instructions to staff in relation  to advising PRC nationals.  It outlines the'-advice  provided in my answer to Question 9 as well as specific  advice on matters such as Health checking and  .  Insurance, Permission to Work and Re-entry Visas.

 (11) My Department's instruction number PC 1601 of 4 July 1989 also instructs staff to grant authority to  work, on reguest,  to PRC nationals in Australia on  4 June with expired entry permits. As well, PRC 

 nationals illegally in Australia may lodge  applications for refugee status and, as eligible, for  permanent residence.

 (12) On 8 December 1989 I reaffirmed that no PRC national  temporarily in Australia on 20 June would have to  return to the PRC in the immediate future unless they  wished to do so. The Government will be making a 

 regulation to permit PRC nationals who were here  illegally on 20 June to receive, on application, a '   special temporary entry permit, valid until 31 January 1991. Further, before a deportation order  can be raised, the Migration Act reguires that a check  be made that there is no valid entry permit application 

 before the Department or a review body.
