 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 29 October 2014   

 Senate demands Morrison's visa ban advice   

 The Senate has supported a Greens' Order for Production of Documents, demanding that the  Immigration Minister table any expert advice he received before announcing his blanket ban on  West African refugees.   

 “This cruel, senseless ban is embarrassing Australia on a global scale and the Minister has to explain  himself," the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Parliament deserves to know what advice, if any, the Minister received before making this  shameful announcement.”   

 “Banning refugees from West Africa is like shuttering up the windows of a house while it burns to  the ground,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “Australians want to help fight Ebola, but they're being held back by this mean-spirited, small-minded and hard-hearted Abbott government."   

 The order, as supported by the Senate, has given the Immigration Minister a deadline of 3 pm  tomorrow to provide a copy of any advice that informed his decision to suspend the humanitarian  intake from Ebola-affected countries.   

 The Greens’ Health spokesperson, Senator Richard Di Natale, said the Immigration Minister should  leave decisions like this to medical experts.   

 “The decision to restrict people’s movements due to Ebola should be made by doctors, not  politicians,” Senator Di Natale said.   

 “The Minister is confusing his ambitions with his abilities and it’s only a matter of time before he  wears a stethoscope and white coat into question time.”
