 BOAT ARRIVALS TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM DARWIN

 All Indo-Chinese "boat people" currently detained in Darwin  will be transferred by chartered aircraft to new  accommodation in Port Hedland, WA, next Monday evening. The  group comprises a total of 104 people - 64 males, 27 females 

 and 13 children.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, who announced this today said the  group was the first of more than 300 unauthorised boat  arrivals being moved to the new processing centre. Others,   mainly in Sydney, would be transferred at a later stage.

 Mr Hand said the new centre, at the former BHP Iron Ore  Single Persons' Quarters at Cooke Point, was now operational  following the completion of repairs and recommissioning  work.

 The accommodation was considerably larger and more  comfortable than the temporary sites where the Darwin-based  groups had been housed.

 Another major benefit of the move he said, was the  considerable savings it would generate in the costs of  housing people who arrive on our shores without a legal  right to enter.

 The Minister said all members of the group were told of the  transfer today and had received a detailed briefing on the  new centre.

 He said the timing of the move had been dictated by the  shortage of aircraft - it was the only time a suitable  commercial aircraft was available.

 Two representatives of community organisation on Port  Hedland and Darwin would accompany the boat people on the  flight.

 The group would be escorted by officers of the Australian  Protective Services and the Immigration Department, Mr Hand  said.
