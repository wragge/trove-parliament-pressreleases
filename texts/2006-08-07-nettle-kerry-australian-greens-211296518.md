 Mental health provisions in new migration laws in the  spotlight as asylum seeker tries to hang himself 

 

 Senator Nettle, 7th August 2006   

 Greens Immigration Spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle today cited an attempted  suicide in the Baxter Immigration Detention Facility on the weekend as further  evidence that the mental health of asylum seekers is being neglected and warned that  the new migration bill before Parliament this week will make things worse.    

 "I was deeply saddened but not surprised to hear that another asylum seeker in  Australia's care tried to kill himself this weekend," Senator Nettle said.    

 "These kinds of tragic incidents are bound to happen when the government has  emptied the dedicated psychiatric ward in Adelaide that previously cared for mentally  ill asylum seekers.    

 "In a briefing I received today from the Department of Immigration about the new  migration laws it was confirmed that Nauru does not have the psychiatric facilities  needed for new asylum seekers arriving on our shores and they may have to be  transferred to a third country to get treatment.    

 "The incident on the weekend further proves that the government is not to be trusted  to put asylum seekers health needs before political priorities, because their track  record is appalling.    

 "We know that the government has closed the Glenside facility after senior  psychiatrists spoke out against the affect that the detention regime has on the mental  health of asylum seekers.    

 "We also know that the psychiatric hospital that asylum seekers are now transferred to  from Baxter has the recent advisor to the Department of Immigration on mental health  as its head clinician.    

 "The Greens cite the ongoing mismanagement of the mental health of asylum seekers  on the mainland as a reason enough to reject the new legislation and call on Coalition  backbenchers to stand firm and reject the bill."
