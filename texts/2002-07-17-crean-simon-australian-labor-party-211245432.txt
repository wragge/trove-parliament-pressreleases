 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PORT LINCOLN, SA, 17 JULY 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Visit to Port Lincoln; paid maternity leave; ALP Reform; Telstra; Baxter Detention facility; asylum seekers; Collingwood Football Club/HIH; proposed nuclear waste dump in SA

 CREAN: It’s terrific to come back to Port Lincoln and just see the extent of development that’s happened, particularly in the aquaculture industry.  It shows what a region can do by building on its traditional strength, that investing in research, in marketing, and the sustainability of the fisheries.  The town itself shows the real prosperity that comes with that.  So, I’m delighted to be back, not only to observe the continuing development of this important industry, but the opportunities for diversification in the region.

 JOURNALIST: …last night John Howard discussed he’s considering paid maternity leave to solve Australia’s birth rate.  What do you think?

 CREAN: Why does he have to just keep saying he’s considering it? Why can’t they make up their mind?  I mean, the Liberal Party is so indecisive on this.  Some members want it, John Howard will look at it.  The Labor Party is the only party that has come out and said that we should have paid maternity leave.  What I’d like to see is the coalition of support to get behind that initiative and it would be better if the Government joined with us in trying to develop an effective model to deliver paid maternity leave rather than just this indecisiveness of the Prime Minister.

 JOURNALIST:  Are you pleased, though, in the very least that he’s actually addressing the issue?

 CREAN: He’s not addressing it.  He’s simply saying he’s prepared to look at it.  Well, the Prime Minister has got to lead and we know that there is need to address work and family relationships.  A part of that is paid maternity leave.  There are other issues to be addressed as well but let’s make a start, let’s be decisive, get the Government to actually lead on the issue.

 JOURNALIST:  So, are you saying you’re going to work together, you know, that’s a possible way?  I mean, what sort of model could you possibly see being introduced?

 CREAN: Well, that’s the issue that has to be worked through.  But you’ve got to make the commitment to do it and then work out the most effective way of delivering it.  I’ve had the opportunity of speaking with not just the industry in this country but also practices overseas.  We would be developing our proposals but it would be far better for the nation if the Government and ourselves worked together to deliver an outcome sooner rather than later.

 JOURNALIST: Is this a population issue or is it a social, and perhaps even, gender issue?

 CREAN: It’s an issue of importance to working families.  It’s an issue that gives them greater flexibility in the way in which they manage the balance between work and raising a family.  It’s about giving individuals greater choice.  It’s not a one-size-fits-all model but it’s government being prepared to support a program that can fit flexibly with individual family needs.  It’s building flexibility into the system in a way that responds to the needs of the family.

 JOURNALIST: Have you got the support of the unions in your new look Labor Party?

 CREAN: I’m convinced that we will get the reforms that are necessary to modernise the Labor Party.  I’ll continue to have discussions. There are issues that people, validly, need to have addressed.  But I’m confident that and committed to driving the reform process forward.

 JOURNALIST: Are they happy with your proposal?

 CREAN: Well, I can’t say that everyone’s delighted with the proposal but I think that as people understand what’s involved and the fact that it’s a much broader agenda item than simply the relationship with the trade union movement, I think they accept that there’s need for reform in the Party and they want to be part of sensible reform programs.

 JOURNALIST: What is your stand on Telstra, on the sale of Telstra?

 CREAN: Labor is committed to no further sale of Telstra.  It’s very interesting that the Government is again flirting with this idea.  The further sale of Telstra will not deliver better services to regional Australia.  Those services are already being questioned with Telstra 49 per cent sold to the private sector.  Just imagine how those services are going to deteriorate if all of it’s sold.  The other question that the Government needs to face up to is

 how does it ensure more access and affordable services in regional Australia? It’s got to start addressing the infrastructure issues.  It’s got to start addressing affordability and access issues, not get preoccupied with selling the rest of Telstra.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, just returning for the moment to the earlier point of reform.  Is your leadership hanging in this?  Do you see any weakening of your leadership if you can’t get these reforms through?

 CREAN: The issue is the need to modernise the Labor Party. We’ve got to move with the times.  We’ve got to be appealing to a broader section of the community.   Our relationship with the trade union movement will always be a vital one because both of us represent working families. We’re the only political party and the only political movement that does that. But that relationship has got to be defined more effectively about the agenda that we pursue - issues like paid maternity leave, issues like the protection of worker entitlements, issues like tax breaks for working families.  These are the sort of issues that matter to working families and that’s the agenda, as part of the modernisation process, that I will be developing.

 JOURNALIST: What about your own position, though?  You didn’t answer that question.

 CREAN: The position of the Labor Party is what matters.  I will lead it.  I am determined to get the reform that’s necessary to have the Labor Party win the next election, the two-phase process - organisational and policy.  But what we will do is bring the organisational issues to a conclusion and then proceed further on the policy initiatives.  I might say we’ve been announcing those policy initiatives as we’ve been going.  But that will be an ongoing process.

 JOURNALIST: Are you prepared to compromise on the loose package that you’ve put forward?

 CREAN: The question of the final package will be a matter for the national conference.  Recommendations will be made to that conference as a result of the Hawke-Wran Review.  That in turn will reflect the submissions that have come from all over the Party.  Our job is to weigh those up.  Our job is to get the best reform package from those submissions.  Our job is to listen to those proposals and come up with a comprehensive package of reform and that’s what my task will be and that’s what I expect will be adopted by the special rules conference in October.

 JOURNALIST: Who determines success?  Do you determine success or is it going to be ultimately the voters?

 CREAN: The Australian people determine success.  If we get it right the prize will be a Labor Government and that will be to the benefit of

 4

 the nation because we’re the only ones prepared to do something on issues like paid maternity leave, on tax breaks for working families, on protection of worker entitlements, on improvements to superannuation.  These are the issues that matter to Australians.  They’re being neglected by the current Government, you’ve got indecision.  From the Labor Party you will have sound policy implementation.  But we have to get there and we’re not going to get there unless we reform ourselves internally and unless and we present policies comprehensively attractive to the Australian public.

 JOURNALIST: And if the Party doesn’t go with you?

 CREAN; Oh well, the Party, I’m sure, will go with me.  Just wait and see.

 JOURNALIST: You’re confident that it’ll be a reformed Party by the time of the next election?

 CREAN: I’m absolutely confident that what the Party accepts is the need to reform itself and to modernise itself.  My task is to give the leadership in that direction.  What I’m confident about is the commonsense of the people that make up the Australian Labor Party and, importantly, I’m mostly confident, I’m absolutely confident about the commonsense of the Australian people.  They want modern policies for a modern Australia.  And that’s what I’m going to deliver.

 JOURNALIST: Are you looking forward to seeing what sort of standard the Baxter Detention facility is going to be like when you visit it tomorrow, given, you know, we’ve seen Woomera, pictures of it in the past, and all the events in the lead-up to it?  What do you think it’s going to hold tomorrow, the actual visit for you?

 CREAN: Well, I don’t know, that’s the purpose of going there. I’ve sought the inspection for the purposes of seeing what the new facility is like because, as you know, I’ve been critical of the Woomera Detention facility.  But we need to develop a sound, comprehensive policy approach. Looking at the Detention Centre is part of that development.

 JOURNALIST: The asylum seekers.  Should they stay or go home?

 CREAN: What we’ve got to do is to better secure the Australian borders.  We do that by having sensible agreements with our neighbours to stop people smugglers leaving their country in the first place.  We also need to have a US-style coast guard to be an effective cop on the beat, enforcing the protection of our borders.

 As for the asylum seekers that make it here, we’ve got to deal with them in a compassionate way.  We’ve got to deal with them as part of our obligations

 as an international citizen.  It requires a better-balanced approach and that’s what the policy that I’ll be bringing forward will present.

 JOURNALIST: Collingwood Football Club and HIH.  Have you got any observations about what might be going on there?

 CREAN: Well, I’ve always got observations about Australian Rules football but most particularly when it has to do with the Kangaroos.  So, I was delighted with their one point thriller on the weekend.  They’re a great fighting team and great fighting spirit.  That’s what I like to see.  As for the Collingwood Football Club, I’ve been interested to read the story.  The Royal Commission needs to take its course and I think we should let it do that.

 JOURNALIST: And what about Mr Buckley?

 CREAN: Well, Mr Buckley has … he can’t comment in terms of tribunal decisions.  I would not dare to.

 JOURNALIST: One more issue.   Nuclear waste.  There is a federal Government proposal to establish a low-level waste dump in South Australia. Where do you stand on this issue?  The Labor Party in South Australia would prefer it to be a State-only repository.  What’s your stance on this?

 CREAN: Well, I must say I haven’t had the opportunity to speak with the South Australian government on this.  I will and I’ll respond …

 JOURNALIST: Do you see a need, though, for a national dump, for something better than leaving the material in hospitals and universities and that sort of thing?

 CREAN: Yes, of course.  I think there is a responsibility if we’re going to utilise those facilities, that decisions be taken about disposal.  But I think that needs proper consideration.  We shouldn’t be making places dumping grounds for nuclear waste.

 JOURNALIST: It’s a federal responsibility, though?

 CREAN: I think it’s a national responsibility.  If the Federal Government gets involved it’s obviously got to have discussions with the appropriate State governments about these things.

 JOURNALIST: And the low level waste that we’re taking about surely, in the long term, it’s undesirable to leave it where it is in those sort of exposed areas?

 CREAN: Well, it depends on how it’s stored.  I mean, you can’t wish it away.  You’ve got to deal with it.  It depends on how it’s stored and it’s the obligation that goes with utilisation.  It can’t be just utilising the … or

 6

 taking advantage of the stuff and trying to wish away how the waste is dealt with.

 JOURNALIST: When would you expect to have a firm policy on this at a federal level?

 CREAN: Well, that’s part of the review that we’re going through at the moment.  I’ve said that the closing date for submissions is the end of this year.
