 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 ANOTHER ARRIVAL PROVIDES TIMELY REMINDER OF  GOVERNMENT'S FAILURES   

 Friday, 9 April 2010    

 This morning’s announcement of another unauthorised boat arrival, only  moments before the Government fronted the media with their bandaid  solution to the surge in boat arrivals, has sent a reminder to Australians 

 that the Rudd Labor Government has lost control over Australia’s borders.    

 The latest arrival stole the thunder from Minister O’Connor’s press  conference, as he attempted to patch-up the Government’s failed policy  on Border Protection.    

 “On a morning when the Government was attempting to look tough on  border protection, another 70 unauthorised arrivals arrived in to time to  spoil the party,” said Mr Keenan.    

 The boat, carrying 70 passengers, is the 38th boat to arrive this year, and  106th since the Rudd Labor Government weakened the policy in August  2008.    

 “Border Protection Command and the AFP are already stretched under the  task of detecting and intercepting the constant flow of arrivals.    

 “Today’s announcement of the deployment of additional AFP officers to  cover the Government’s policy failure on Christmas Island will only  compound the problems facing the AFP.    

 “The boats will keep coming until this Government takes real action to  restore security to Australia’s borders.”
