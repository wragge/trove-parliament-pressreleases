 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION

 TO VISIT PORT HEDLAND

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Philip  Ruddock MP, will be visiting Port Hedland this week from Wednesday  15 July until Friday 17 July 1992.

 This will be Mr Ruddock's first visit to Port Hedland since the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs established the facility  at Port Hedland late in 1991, as a holding and processing centre for  unauthorised entrants to Australia. "

 Mr Ruddock will inspect the facilities and conditions at the detention  centre, hold discussions with staff from Department of Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs and meet some of the detainees to hear their stories  first-hand. He will also be meeting with lawyers from the Refugee 

 Council of Australia, and Church representatives including Catholic  priest Father Larry Reitmeyer.

 "It is a regrettable situation that the refugee determination process in  Australia is backlogged by over 23,000 applicants and that some people  are held in detention for as long as two years" Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Coalition has consistently called for the immediate repatriation  of those people whose claims have proven to be unfounded so that  assistance can be given to genuine refugees, many of whom are  languishing in squalid border camps in Asia".
