 AUSTRALIA TO PROVIDE FOOD AID TO AFGHAN REFUGEES IN  PAKISTAN

 Australia will provide wheat worth $4.9 million as food aid to  Afghan refugees in Pakistan, the Acting Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade,  Kim Beazley, announced today.

 Pakistan is currently hosting some 3.5 million Afghan refugees,  most of whom are unlikely to begin to return to Afghanistan  before mid-1989.

 "Australia's contribution will provide and transport 20,000  tonnes of wheat grain to Pakistan for refugee camps along the  Afghan border," Mr Beazley said.

 The food aid will be in addition to the $20 million Australian  contribution to phase one of a United Nations Humanitarian and  Economic Assistance Program relating to Afghanistan announced  in June.

 Since 1979 Australia has provided aid to Afghan refugees in  Pakistan worth more than $40 million mainly in the form of  wheat and some medical assistance.

 "Australia is committed to providing appropriate support to ^   these refugees while they await resettlement," Mr Beazley said.

 Australia's support for Afghan refugees in Pakistan forms part  of the Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
