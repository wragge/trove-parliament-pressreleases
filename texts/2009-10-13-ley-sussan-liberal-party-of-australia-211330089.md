 MINISTER O’CONNOR WELCOMES 41ST BOAT ARRIVAL 

 The Hon Sussan Ley MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 “Border Protection Command’s (BPC) interception of the 41st unauthorised boat arrival since Labor weakened 

 our border protection system in August 2008 shows that the Rudd Government is happy to compromise the 

 integrity of our borders,” Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Sussan Ley said today.  

 “Once again Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O’Connor shrugs off the fact that our borders are being inundated 

 with a surge of unauthorised boat arrivals due to their failed border protection policy.  

 The boat was intercepted late yesterday north-west of Ashmore Island by the BPC patrol vessel HMAS Albany. 

 This latest arrival carrying 56 passengers, including 2 children and 2 crew members brings the number of 

 unauthorised arrivals to 1984 since August 2008.  

 “The Coalition have repeatedly called for an immediately independent inquiry into the relationship between 

 Labor’s changes in policy and the huge surge in people smuggling activity - however it falls on deaf ears,” Ms 

 Ley said.  

 “While Customs is forced to deploy their resources up north to intercept the surge of arrivals, organised criminal 

 syndicates continue their activities at our ports and airports.  

 “This Labor Government is soft on national security and has completely lost control of our borders. What kind of 

 message is this sending to the insidious world of people smugglers?” Ms Ley said.
