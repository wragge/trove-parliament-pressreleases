 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 10 December 2013   

 Senate votes to stop government separating  mothers from their children   

 The Senate has passed an Australian Greens’ motion urging the Minister for Immigration to give  refugee mothers and fathers unrestricted access to their babies after forced separations came  to light in recent weeks.   

 “Separating mothers and fathers from their children is unacceptable,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “No parent should be forcefully separated from their baby and the government should commit  to ending this practice immediately.   

 “The case of a mother from Myanmar who was separated from her sick baby in November  exposed this cruel practice as Abbott Government policy and people were rightly outraged.   

 “As a nation we should be doing everything that we can to care for refugees, especially children.   

 “With more than a thousand children in Australian detention centres and others dumped in the  shocking conditions on Nauru, it’s clear that this situation is out of control.   

 “There would be Coalition MPs who are uncomfortable with forced separations and I call on  them to speak up and support these parents’ rights.”   

 The motion, as supported by the Senate, is below.
