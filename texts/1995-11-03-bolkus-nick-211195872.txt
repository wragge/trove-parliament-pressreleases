  INCREASED CORE FUNDING FOR MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRES 

  Australia's national network of Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs)  has been awarded $7.8m in annual core funding, the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, announced  today. 

  The funding is for the running costs of the 28 MRCs around the  country from October 1 1995 to September 30 1996. 

  Up from $5.9m last year, the core funding takes in the extra  annual funding for MRCs announced in the 1995 Budget. 

  "The increased core funding will help the MRCs improve their  advice, referral and counselling services for migrants,  particularly those who have special needs, like newly arrived  refugees, women, and unemployed people of non-English speaking  background," Senator Bolkus said. 

  Reforms flowing from the increased funds include: 

  the establishment of three new NSW MRCs in Parramatta,  Auburn and Ashfield, and another in Logan in Queensland; 

  supplementation of operating costs; 

  a new worker for each Centre currently operating with four  core staff. 

  "Migrant Resource Centres have long provided an excellent range  of practical services for clients, as well as providing a base  for ethnic communities' educational, cultural and social  activities," Senator Bolkus said. 

  "They are also a catalyst for raising awareness of migrant needs,  and of the services needed to meet those needs. 

  "The extra funding recognises the critical role they play, and  the new challenges they face in providing an integrated  settlement strategy for both established and emerging migrant  communities."
