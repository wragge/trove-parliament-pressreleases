 33 MORE REASONS TO END THE  ‘PACIFIC SOLUTION’    

 

 Labor welcomes the decision by the Stanhope ACT Government to assist in the  resettlement in Canberra of 33 Afghan refugees from Nauru.   

 The Stanhope Government’s provision of English language training is a welcome  addition to the resettlement assistance given to families making a new home in Australia.   

 Labor has had a commitment of granting Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders  access to English language training and the Job network since its National Conference in  January this year.   

 The Afghan families have been held in Australian immigration detention as part of the  Howard Government’s so called ‘Pacific Solution’, and are part of the 146 Afghans from  Nauru that the Government has recently re-assessed as refugees.   

 Once resettlement of these 146 has occurred, nearly 500 of the asylum seekers originally  placed on Nauru and Manus Island will have been resettled in Australia.     

 This is a far cry from the mantra of the Howard Government seeking re-election in 2001  that not one of these people would set foot on Australian soil.   

 The Howard Government’s ‘Pacific Solution’ has already cost us over $200 million.  The  Budget papers indicate another $85 million in the next financial year with anywhere up to  $300 million in the forward estimates.  These are extraordinary allocation of funds. 

 

 Yesterday there was a change of Government in Nauru and the Howard Government  should take the opportunity with the new Government to put an end to the ‘Pacific  Solution’, which is now nothing more than an expensive farce.
