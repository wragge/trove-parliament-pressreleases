 ***** UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL 12.00AM AEST 20 JUNE 2005 *****   

 $6.2 million for Middle East refugees on World Refugee Day   

 On World Refugee Day 2005, I am pleased to announce today a package of $6.2 million in  humanitarian assistance for Palestinian refugees, who represent a significant proportion of the  world’s refugees. 

 These funds will be administered by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for  Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).  UNRWA provides health, education, shelter  and food aid to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.  

 UNRWA estimates that more than four million registered Palestinian refugees live in the  Middle East including over one and a half million in the Palestinian territories. 

 Australia’s assistance will provide vital services including emergency employment  generation, shelter reconstruction, health and education.   

 The $6.2 million is made up of $4.2 million in core funding to UNRWA and   $2 million to support their 2005 Emergency Appeal for the Palestinian territories.  

 It brings Australia’s total aid to the Palestinian people to $12 million in 2004-2005.  

 This support for the Middle East peace process aims to reduce the vulnerability of  Palestinians to poverty and conflict and is the overarching goal of the Australian Development  Co-operation in the Middle East Strategy for 2004-2006.  

 Australia also recently announced an allocation of $15 million from AusAID's International  Refugee Fund for the financial year 2005/06 to support refugees, internally displaced people  (IDPs) and asylum seekers in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, South East Asia and the  Pacific.
