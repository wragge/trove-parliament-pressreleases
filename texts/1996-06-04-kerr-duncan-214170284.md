 Coalition Comes To Fork In The Road Qn Immigration Policy

 The Federal Coalition has embarked on a course of action since the federal  election which has seriously brought into question its commitment on  immigration policy, Shadow Immigration Minister Duncan Kerr told the  Second Women in Migration Conference in Sydney today.

 Mr Kerr said there had been changes and broken commitments on key  elements of policy, which before now had in the main been bipartisan for a  number of years.

 "Under the Howard Government we have seen the Office of Multicultural  Affairs, responsible for the central coordination of access and equity  programs, suffer an unfunded transfer from its powerful position in the  Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and its disappearance within 

 the out of Cabinet Department of Immigration.

 “And we have seen breaches of the Coalition's pre-election pledge to  maintain the level of the humanitarian and refugee program and of its  undertaking to maintain an adequate safety net and full family payment for  new arrivals to Australia who will be subject to the extended two year waiting  period.

 "This latter matter will impact particularly severely on women.

 “As Susan Young and Ros Madden pointed out in their paper Characteristics  of Women Migrating to Australia and their Migration Decisions, presented at  the first 1992 Women in Migration Conference, “Eligibility for migration to  Australia is determined by the ‘principal applicant’ in a family or group and this  person is usually male. Thus many immigrants especially women (and their  children) are defined in terms of someone else, not necessarily in relation to  their own circumstances or capabilities."

 Mr Kerr said there was a cruel unfairness of leaving such dependants in need  if their partner’s support failed.

 “And we are seeing discriminatory outcomes (with country of origin being the  defining difference) tolerated,” he said.

 “So we look through the glass darkly trying to discern the approach the new  Government will adopt and hoping that these initial measures will be reviewed  and reversed "

 4 June 1996

 Not as an Afterthought

 It is now three months since the defeat of the Keating Government  brought to an end thirteen years of the Australian Labor Party’s agenda  setting at the national level.

 The elements of that agenda are well known; a commitment to  multiculturalism, strategies of Access and Equity, a rejection of  discrimination on the grounds of gender, sexual preference, race,  ethnicity or country of origin and a growing debate about strategies for  active citizenship.

 Necessarily between vision and reality must fall the shadow and it is  wise to recognise that not all our aspirations as set out in the National  Agenda and in our Access and Equity strategy were or, could be, fully  met.

 But the strategy and how we went about addressing the dilemma  identified by Dr Andrew Theophanous (the former Parliamentary  Secretary to the Prime Minister) namely, “how to establish a concept of  nationhood that his not necessarily based on one common past, one set  of common traditions, and one uniform culture,” is clear. In Government  we sought to evolve a concept of nationhood that allowed for the 

 greatest level of diversity, defended the right to be different yet at the  same time confidently asserted a unifying Australian nationalism and  republicanism.

 So we can review the past 13 years , warts and all, and this conference  will allow a first assessment of that epoch. Of course there will be areas  worthy of your criticism. Don Plimer and Christopher Candlin’s  Language Services for Non English Speaking Background Women finds,  for example, that English Language policies adopted during the early 

 1990’s, which strongly linked English language training with the labour  market, missed addressing the needs of many women. So I accept that  the positive measures In our Access and Equity strategy themselves  sometimes fell short of our aspirations and failed to treat women's 

 experience adequately.

 And there are dilemmas to consider. For example Patricia Esteal's work,  Shattered Dreams examines the experience of overseas born women  and violence in the home. Whilst Shattered Dreams doesn’t show that  domestic violence is more prevalent in immigrant communities it does  illustrate that aspects of ethnicity or the migration experience can  contribute to violence in the home. Her book shows the particular  vulnerability of two groups, Asian women sponsored by non-Asian men 

 and brides of arranged marriages. Her work should warn that the ideal of  multiculturalism is not merely a charter of rights but also requires  responsibility from all of us, together with an acceptance of limits to  cultural diversity excluding those which violate universal norms of 

 respect for human equality.

 But the more interesting outlook for a conference such as this is never   just the past, for, though it is another land, at least we have been there.  Most interesting is what can we look forward to.

 Were we to judge the Coalition by its pre-election policy, the answer to  what we can look forward to under a Howard Government would have  been broadly that we could have looked forward to a continuation of the  past decade’s approach with some modifications.

 But since the election there have been changes and broken  commitments on key elements of what had hitherto been bipartisan  since the aftermath of the 1988 debates on multiculturalism sparked by  John Howard in his previous incarnation as leader of the Opposition.

 For example, under the Howard Government we have seen the Office of  Multicultural Affairs, responsible for the central coordination of access  and equity programs suffer an unfunded transfer from Its powerful  position in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and its  disappearance within the out of cabinet Department of Immigration.

 And we have seen breaches of the Coalition’s pre-election pledge to  maintain the level of the humanitarian and refugee program and of its  undertaking to maintain an adequate safety-net and full family payment  for new arrivals to Australia who will be subject to the extended two year  waiting period.

 This latter measure will impact particularly severely on women. As  Susan Young and Ros Madden pointed out in their paper Characteristics  of Women Migrating to Australia and their Migration Decisions,

 presented at the first 1992 Women in Migration Conference, “Eligibility  for migration to Australia is determined by the ‘principal applicant1  in a  family or group and this person is usually male. Thus many immigrants  especially women [and their children] are defined - in terms of someone  else, not necessarily in relation to their ow n circumstances or 

 capabilities’’.

 The cruel unfairness of leaving such dependants In need if their  partner's support fails ought be clear to anyone with a conscience.

 And we are seeing discriminatory outcomes (with country of origin being  the defining difference) tolerated.

 So we look through the glass darkly trying to discern the approach the  new Government will adopt and hoping that these initial measures will be  reviewed and reversed.

 I believe there are many good people in the new Government who will  also be alarmed by these straws in the wind - but without academic  analysis and community action to stimulate their good willed response  many of the gains of the past - gains of tolerance, cultural diversity,  respect for the most disadvantaged, positive support for women, and the  right of those from multicultural background to access the full range of  social and economic opportunities this nation has to offer, could be lost.  As a community we cannot leave these issues as afterthoughts. I wish  you and your deliberations well.
