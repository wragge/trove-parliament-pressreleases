 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION,  LOCAL GOVERNMENT  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS AHEAD IN IMMIGRATION MATTERS, SAYS MINISTER ,

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mick Young,  today described 1987 as a year of sure and steady progress in  the immigration field. And he foreshadowed continuing progress

 The most significant event of the past year, he said, was the â    Government's decision to establish the Committee to Advise on  Australia's Immigration Policies (CAAIP) - the body which is  assessing current policies and which will make recommendations  on our immigration future.

 The Committee was consulting widely in the community at the  moment to obtain a representative cross-section of views which  would be taken into account in formulating its recommendations.

 "The Government established CAAIP to look at the broad  relationship between immigration and the social, cultural and  population development of Australia," Mr. Young said.

 "The Committee's recommendations will help to frame our  immigration policies for the years ahead."

 "Quite obviously, its report, which I will receive in March,  be a major highlight of the coming year."

 Th^Minister listed these further examples of progress during

 improvements in settlement services for migrants,  including:

 . the provision of extra funding to cover an additional  eight grants under the Grant-in-Aid scheme, and for  additional Migrant Resource Centre support ?

 . a 17 per cent increase in funding for the Adult  Migrant Education Program (AMEP), plus additional  funding to implement key recommendations of the  Campbell Report which reviewed the Program;

 . the computerisation of the Telephone Interpreter Service, resulting in an increased capacity to handle  calls;

 . the introduction of more self-contained on-arrival  accommodation for refugees and Special Humanitarian  Program migrants;

 . the enhancement of services for aged and disabled  migrants under the Home and Community Care Program  (administered by the Department of Community Services  and Health)? -  .  ,

 improvements in Departmental services, including:

 . the forthcoming decentralisation of operations in  Sydney and Melbourne to improve client access;

 . a reduction in processing times for most services  provided by Regional Offices;

 . the re-establishment of full-service offices in  Geelong, Wollongong and Newcastle;

 . the establishment of additional Immigration Review  Panels in South Australia, Western Australia and  Queensland to speed up the process of reviewing  Departmental decisions, together with increased staff  and devolution of the Departments review function to  Regional Offices to improve speed and efficiency in  handling future appeals;

 . the upgrading of Citizenship Certificates;

 improvements in overseas operations, including:

 â¦ the introduction of more streamlined processing for  skilled migrants in the hospitality, accounting and  mining fields;

 . the enhancement of Business Migration Program  processing with the decision to use accredited  private agencies to contact and process prospective  migrants;

 . the implementation of new procedures under a "Skills  Transfer Scheme" allowing the short-term entry of  skilled people from overseas to work in certain jobs;

 . the installation of a computerised system to cope  more efficiently and effectively with the issue of  visitor visas in countries with high visitor  interest, in particular Japan and North America.

 Mr. Young said that clients of his Department could expect  continuing improvements in service in 1988. As part of these  initiatives, a three-year access and equity plan would be  published early in the New Year, setting out goals to be  achieved during that period.

 One matter which could not be expected in 1988 was an amnesty  for people living in Australia illegally.

 "I emphasise again what I have said on a number of occasions  during the past year .., there will be no further amnesties for  illegal migrants," he added.
