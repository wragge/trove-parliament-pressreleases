 $3 million relief package for Sudan

 Australia is to contribute aid funds totalling $3 million to assist relief and rehabilitation efforts  in Sudan, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Neal Blewett, announced today.

 “About eight million people are currendy affected by drought and civil war in Sudan. Many of  these people have been made homeless and rely heavily on food and medical assistance,”  Dr Blewett said.

 The $3 million package will be provided in the form of cash grants to Australian non­ government organisations and to United Nations and other international agencies.

 In the regions worst hit by drought, Save the Children Fund Australia will receive $350 000 to  provide emergency food and medical supplies. CARE Australia is to receive $365 000 to  support supplementary feeding programs for malnourished children and nursing and pregnant 

 women.

 The Australian Council of Churches will receive $160 000 for relief and rehabilitation work  with long term Ethiopian refugees in Sudan, and $25 000 will go to the Archbishop of  Melbourne’s International Relief and Development Fund to assist displaced people living in 

 camps around Khartoum.

 For the areas in the south most affected by civil war, World Vision Australia will receive  $550 000 to purchase relief supplies and to support health and agriculture recovery programs,  and $300 000 will be provided to the International Committee for the Red Cross for its tracing,  medical assistance and relief activities in southern Sudan.

 The remaining $1.25 million will support relief operations being carried out by United Nations  agencies.

 The World Food Programme will receive $500 000, primarily to transport emergency supplies  into the worst affected areas. $500 000 will be provided to UNICEF for programs under  Operation Lifeline Sudan, including immunisation, supplementary food, medical supplies,  seeds, tools and fishing equipment. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  will receive $250,000 for its program to repatriate Ethiopian refugees following the end of the  civil war in Ethiopia.

 This emergency assistance to Sudan forms part of the Australian Government’s program of  international development assistance administered by the Australian International Development  Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).  * * * * *
