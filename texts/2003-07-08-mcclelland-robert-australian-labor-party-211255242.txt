 Malaysia moves ahead with new Coastguard   

 Reports today that Malaysia is joining the countries in the Asia-Pacific region  who  have  established  a  dedicated  Coastguard  shows  the  Howard   Government is out of step on border security.   

 The Shipping  Times  today  reported  that  Malaysia  is  moving  to  establish  a   dedicated  Coastguard  that  will  be  modelled  on  the  Japanese  Coastguard   and  will  consolidate  some  11  maritime  law  enforcement  units  currently   charged with protecting the Malaysian coastline of some 4,600km.   

 A Federal Labor Government will establish an Australian Coastguard, with a  new fleet of larger offshore patrol vessels, purpose-built for border protection,  capable  of  operating  right  out  to  Christmas  Island  and  the  Indian  Ocean   territories.   

 The  Coastguard  would  supplement  and  free  up  the  resources  of  the  Navy,   not detract from them as the Prime Minister mistakenly suggested yesterday.   

 Australia has over 37,000km of coastline yet we still do not have a dedicated  Coastguard.   The  Howard  Government  should  not  be  ignoring  overseas   advances  in  maritime  policing  including  steps  being  taken  by  our  regional   neighbours.   

 Last  week’s  undetected  arrival  of  a  vessel  carrying  Vietnamese  asylum-seekers due to bungled and uncoordinated intelligence and surveillance by  the Howard Government shows just how inadequate our coastal security is.   

 The  Howard  Government  is  neglecting  its  obligation  to  protect  Australian   citizens from drug and gun runners as well as people smugglers.   

 Only  a  Federal  Labor  Government  will  secure  Australia’s  borders  with  a   Coastguard.
