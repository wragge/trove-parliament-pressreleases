 New Appointments to the Migration Review Tribunal

 The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kay Patterson, today announced four new appointments to the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT).

 Mr Michael Griffin, who is currently a full-time Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, and Mr Steve Karas, a part-time Member of the MRT, have been appointed as Senior Members. 

 Ms Robin Hunt, who is also a part-time Member, has been appointed as a full-time Member, while Ms Megan Hodgkinson has been appointed as a part-time Member, her first appointment to a Commonwealth tribunal.

 And earlier this year Ms Susanne Tongue was reappointed as Acting Principal Member of the MRT. Ms Tongue was instrumental in establishing the tribunal and has been at the helm since it was formed on June 1, 1999.

 The appointments will cease on 31 January 2001 when the MRT and the Refugee Review Tribunal are expected to be amalgamated into the new Administrative Review Tribunal, which is due to commence on 1 February 2001.

 "The appointments bring further experience to the MRT and will ensure the tribunal is sufficiently staffed to be able to undertake its responsibilities," Senator Patterson said.
