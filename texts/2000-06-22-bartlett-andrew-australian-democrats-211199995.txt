 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 22 Jun 2000 Press Release Number: 00/364 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Senate renews call for Kosovars to be allowed to stay The Senate today supported calls to extend the visas of those Kosovar refugees still in Australia and to allow them to apply for refugee status.

 A motion moved by the Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, calling for a fair go for the Kosovars was passed by the Senate with ALP support.

 “The Democrats, the ALP, Amnesty International and many Australians who have welcomed the Kosovars into their communities believe the Kosovar refugees should be allowed to test their claims for refugee status through the usual system,” said Senator Bartlett.

 Senator Bartlett, who met with some of the remaining Kosovar refugees this week urged Minister Ruddock to reconsider any forced deportation of the Kosovar refugees.

 Supporters of the remaining Kosovar refugees have established a travelling ‘embassy’ outside Parliament House this week. On Friday there will be protests around the country at Department of Immigration officers to highlight the plight of refugees disadvantaged by the temporary safe haven legislation.

 Of the 3,900 Kosovars who were welcomed to Australia in 1999, 329 remain here. For many their visas expire on the 30 June 2000.

 "Those that want to remain in Australia and have a proven fear of persecution upon their return should be allowed to apply for refugee status," said Senator Bartlett.

 “We are talking about a couple of hundred people - tiny numbers in the immigration program - but a couple of hundred people who have been through unimaginable trauma and now want to make Australia home,” said Senator Bartlett.

 The motion passed by the Senate today (22 June) read:

 The Senate:

 1. Notes

 (a) That there are 329 refugees from Kosovo still in Australia, many of whose visas expire on June 30, 2000

 (b) The continuing reports of widespread violence, persecution and political instability in Kosovo.

 (2) The willingness of the Australian community and a number of state governments to assist and support those Kosovar people still in Australia

 2. Strongly urges the Government to extend the visas of those Kosovars still in Australia and enable them to test their claims for refugee status in accordance with international law and the usual Australian refugee determination procedures.
