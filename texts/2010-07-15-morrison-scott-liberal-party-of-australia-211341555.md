 Scott Morrison 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 $1.1 billion and counting on Labor's  asylum budget blow out  15/07/10  

 Figures released by the Treasury show that Labor’s failed border protection policies  have now cost taxpayers an extra $334 million in new capital expenditure on  detention centres, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison  said today. 

 “Yesterday the Government announced another $98 million in new capital  expenditure on detention centres. This is in addition to the $236 million in capital and  $777 million in extra operational costs, announced since February this year,” Mr  Morrison said. 

 “One third of a billion dollars has now been committed to new projects and the total  budget blow out due to Labor’s failed immigration and border protection policies is  now in excess of $1.1 billion,” he said. 

 “The reason for the blow out is simple. We have had 147 illegal boat arrivals carrying  more than 7,000 people. There is now more than 4,000 people in detention, including  561 children. There were just four people who had arrived illegally by boat in  detention in November 2007. 

 “This is what Minister Evans should be lamenting, his costly failure of policy, not his  failure to re-educate the Australian public about the all knowing wisdom of the Labor  Government. 

 “When you consider that the establishment costs of Nauru were just $80 million and  operational expenses were $289 million over 6 years, it shows just how disastrous  Labor’s failed policies have been. 

 “And now Julia Gillard is trying to put one over the Australian people about their  ‘never never’ solution of regional processing in East Timor. 

 “The cost of establishing a centre in East Timor where there is no power or other  infrastructure should be causing the Government to reconsider their approach alone.  The fact that the East Timorese Parliament and senior members of the Government  have denounced the plan make it plain that this is never going to happen. 

 “The Government of Nauru says they are happy to talk about reopening a centre that  is already there, yet Julia Gillard will not talk to them,” he said.
