 BURMESE EMBASSY: A P P L I C A T I O N S  FOR REFU G E E  S T ATUS A ND P O L I T I C A L A S Y L U M

 The First Secretary, Mr. U M y i n t  Soe, the Second S e c r e t a r y  Mr. U 

 Maung Maung Nyo and the C hance llor of the Burm e s e  Emba s s y  in 

 Canbe rr a Mr. U Htoo Myint are today app l y i n g  to the A u s t r a l i a n 

 Gov er n m e n t  for refugee status and/or po litic al a s ylum in  Australia.

 A copy of the a p p l i c a t i o n s  lodged on their beha l f  by  Mr. P h i l i p 

 Smyth, their lawyer, is attached.

 The ap p l i c a t i o n s  f o ll ow d i s c u s s i o n s  whic h I have had over the 

 last 48 hours with Mr. Smyth. This a f t e r n o o n  I s aw the First 

 Secretary, the Second S e c r e t a r y  and the C h a n c e l l o r  in my rooms at 

 Parliamen t H o u s e .

 It is not ne c e s s a r y  to express a v i e w  as to w h i c h  m o d e  of 

 a p pl ic at ion  should be accepted. But it is p e r f e c t l y  plain that 

 the A u s t r a l i a n  G o v e r n m e n t  must prov ide them, and their families,  with sanctuary. They believe that on their return to Burma they 

 face a r r e s t , d e t e n t i o n  and pos s i b l e  execut ion. One of t h e m , the 

 Second Secretary, has in fact been orde r e d  to return to Burma by 

 the 28th N o v e m b e r . The A m b a s s a d o r  was r e c e n t l y  o r d e r e d  back to 

 Burma and is there at present.

 These a p p l ic at ion s to the A u s t r a l i a n  G o v e r n m e n t  h i g h l i g h t  the  hor rific  train of events in Burma and the g r e a t  loss of life and 

 suffering that has been expe r i e n c e d  t h e r e .

 I have no doubt that the A u s t r a l i a n  G o v e r n m e n t  will make the 

 right de c i s i o n  and provide sanctuary.
