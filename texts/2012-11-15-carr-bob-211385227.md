 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Senator the Hon. Bob Carr  November 15, 2012    

 U.S. SUPPORT FOR AUSTRALIA’S PLAN TO PROTECT  MEDICAL WORKERS IN SYRIA    

 Foreign Minister Bob Carr has won the backing of US Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton for an Australian-led plan to protect medical workers and maintain access  to hospitals for families caught in Syria’s civil war.    

 Senator Carr said the plan had been raised with Secretary Clinton during Ausmin  talks in Perth yesterday (November 14).    

 “I welcome Secretary Clinton’s support and her commendation of Australia’s  initiative in supporting medical care for Syrian civilians,” Senator Carr said.    

 “This is a minimalist plan to protect hospitals and health workers in Syria and  help the thousands of families cut off from basic care.    

 “American support will be critical in securing further international backing.”    

 Senator Carr said the plan was not a political or military intervention, and had  become necessary because of the Security Council deadlock over a ceasefire.    

 The Australian plan would involve securing a commitment from all sides in the  Syrian conflict: 

 â¢ Not to target medical personnel;  

 â¢ Not to block access to doctors, hospitals or emergency care; and   â¢ Not to attack medical facilities.  

 

 Implementation could be observed by a neutral third party such as a non-government organisation.    

 The plan has now been positively received from leaders in the United Nations,  the Arab League, the Joint Special Envoy to Syria Mr Lakdar Brahimi and from  European and Arab foreign Ministers.    

 Further support would be sought at an upcoming Friends of Syria meeting in  Morocco - a global gathering of nations seeking solutions to Syria’s ongoing civil  conflict.    

 More than 30,000 Syrians have died since fighting began, and the United Nations  has estimated more than 2 ½ million others are in need of humanitarian care.   There are an estimated 350,000 Syrian refugees in camps in Turkey, Jordan,  Lebanon and Iraq.  Australia is the third largest national contributor to humanitarian aid for Syria,  behind the United States and the United Kingdom.  Minister’s office: 0435 658 623
