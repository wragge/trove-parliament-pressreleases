 Ann Corcoran - Member for Isaacs  Shadow Parliamentary Secretary For Immigration   

 

 Dump The TPV's    

 Media Statement - 11th October 2006   

 Labor’s Social Policy Committee has handed a report to the Immigration Shadow Minister which 

 recommends that Temporary Protection Visas be abolished. 

 

 “The Committee could find no evidence or argument for continuing the TPV regime”, said Ann 

 Corcoran MP, the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Secretary of Labor’s 

 Social Policy Committee. 

 

 “We are recommending that if a person is found to be a refugee, that that person is given a 

 permanent protection immediately, regardless of how he or she arrived in Australia. 

 

 A refugee on a TPV can spend many years separated from his or her family and living in a 

 constant state of uncertainty. This isolation and often leads to mental illness. 

 

 Ms Corcoran said, “The evidence shows that most TPV holders eventually get permanent 

 protection. It makes no sense to treat these refugees so badly. This harsh treatment is not a good 

 start in a new country. 

 

 Equally the Committee could find no argument for denying asylum seekers, work rights or access 

 to Medicare whilst their claim for asylum is being processed. 

 

 “The lack of work rights leaves many asylum seekers, who are able to work, without any means of 

 supporting themselves. It can lead to destitution, homelessness and hopelessness. It throws them 

 onto the scarce resources of charities, resources that should be used to help those who cannot 

 help themselves, Ms Corcoran said.
