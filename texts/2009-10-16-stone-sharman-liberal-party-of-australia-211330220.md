 RUDD MUST NOT WASH HIS HANDS OF SRI LANKAN ASYLUM SEEKERS 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Prime Minister Rudd cannot wash his hands of the 255 Sri Lankan asylum seekers refusing to disembark their 

 vessel in Indonesia.  

 For him to simply say, “It’s Indonesia’s responsibility now”, is to deny the fact that it was his government’s 

 weakening of strong border protection policies which lured the boat in the first place.  

 He forced the Indonesians to intercept the boat because there was no room on Christmas Island to take any 

 more asylum seekers.  

 The spokesperson for the asylum seekers themselves, the Federal police and Indonesian officials all 

 acknowledge that it is Kevin Rudd’s softening of immigration policy which has put the people smugglers back in 

 business.  

 The UNHCR should quickly process the claims of these people and the thousands more waiting in Indonesian 

 detention centres for resettlement. If they are found to be genuine refugees they should be resettled in a country 

 prepared to offer them protection without any delay.  

 Mr Rudd’s policy strategy seems to be “find more beds” and also hope that Indonesia can keep up their 

 interceptions on our behalf. This is no solution.  

 Collecting the boats at our borders and guiding them to Christmas Island is not the solution - that is exactly what 

 the people smugglers and asylum seekers want.  

 Mr Rudd must at last acknowledge that his policy failures are part of the problem. He must do more than talk 

 tough.  

 The Australian public demands action and not empty rhetoric Mr Rudd.
