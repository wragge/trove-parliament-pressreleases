 AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 1984

 The debate on this Bill comes at a time when race  has become a central issue in Australian politics.

 The debates and incidents in this Parliament and  the media over the last couple 6f days should give  us all cause to pause and contemplate.

 Immigration has been the foundation on which this  country was built. W e in Australia have more  overseas born people than any other nation in the  world, except Israel. .

 One would have thought that historical legacy  would have given us a special sensitivity to 

 migrants. The attitude of the Opposition's

 spokesperson on this question is to be deeply 

 regretted.

 Yesterday, .Mr Hodgman1s speech made l i t t l e reference to facts or details about the make-up of  Australia's immigration policy,, but was charged  with rhetoric about radicalism, republicanism, the  Queen, the flag and other matters.

 As ''The Australian" editorial noted this morning:

 It is not only acceptable, it is desirable 

 that, there should be a rational discussion  of such a basic element of our national 

 life as our immigration policy."

 "It is quite proper to point to the 

 problems which could arise in a time of  unemployment from bringing in large  numbers of settlers with easily 

 identifiable distinguishing

 characteristics.

 "But accusations as to who "brought the  Asians in" and similar attempts at 

 point-scoring can only heighten latent  racial tensions and make rational argument  impossible.

 "W e need a debate on immigration. It 

 should not be stifled by misguided efforts  - to avoid accusations of "racism". But, 

 unless it is carried on with moderation 

 and respect for other points of view, we  shall come to no sensible conclusion and  Australia will become an ugly place to  live in."

 I commend those sentiments wholeheartedly.

 This Bill deals with a number of specifics about  citizenship, the end result of the immigration  process. The majority of those specifics have the  Democrats' support, but I will come back to them.

 I want to assist in setting the foundation for a 

 rational debate on immigration that is to take 

 place in this country from now to the election 

 later this year as, clearly, the Opposition now  resiled from bi-partisanship in this area and 

 identified it as an issue on which it  can win 

 votes.

 The debate has been couched in terms of whether or  not current policy is pro- or anti-Asian or 

 British. â 

 This characterization is grossly misleading. You  cannot compare Asia with Britain and Ireland.

 There is no such country as Asia. It is not one 

 entity, but a misused term for a number of 

 seperate nations. It is malicious for the 

 Opposition's spokespeople to contrast one nation  with one region and claim bias. If there is bias 

 it is- that i l l - f i t t i n g  comparison. Unfortunately  it  is a comparison encouraged by the way the 

 Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  present its data.

 In 1982/83 the major sources of settler arrivals  to Australia, including refugees were:

 - Britain and Ireland (27,249), 29.2%

 - Asia (24,486), 26.3%

 The bulk of the Asian component (52.1%) were  refugees. If some people are considering cutting  Asian immigration, which the Democrats are not,  then they will have to reduce the refugee intake.  That is an inhumane and callous view that cannot  be substantiated for a country like Australia.

 But if we look at source countries rather than 

 these fictitous regions, an altogether different  picture altogether emerges.

 For 1982-83 the major source countries for settler  arrivals were:

 - Britain (26,337), 34.6% of

 non-refugee intake. - New Zealand (7757) - 10.2% - Germany (4861) - 6.4%

 ,  2 .

 I would l ike to incorporate in Hansard a de'i%fWe< <   lablU Llia'L—contains thoss figures. The t a W i  sil^ATE  from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs' 1982-83 Review. [1]

 That table shows that no country even comes close  to Britain' s predominant situation as a source of  s e tt le r s for Australia.

 The family reunion programme makes up two-thirds  of the current government's intake.

 I seek leave to incorporate a table that sets out 

 what has happened in relation to applications and  arrivals. [2] It clearly shows that while arrivals  from UK/Ireland/Europe have decreased by A% , an  increase of arrivals from Asia have increased by  only 2% last year over the previous year.

 However, applications from Europe dropped off  substantially in that year while those from Asia  have increased.

 That is not a change in policy. That is a result 

 of the humane and enlightened refugee intake  embarked upon by the Fraser Government. That was a  courageous policy that had the support of all 

 political parties.

 It is unrealistic to expect, even inconceivable to  believe, that we could accept refugees in the late  1970's and refuse their families in the 1980’s .

 Of course Asian applications for family reunion  have increased. There are some 90,000 Asians  resident. They want to be with their families. W e  let the British and the Europeans be with theirs. 

 Asian people are not second class. They must not  be discriminated against.

 For the Opposition to raise this fact as a concern  seems to indicate they . want some form of 

 discrimination. How else are they going to reduce  intake of Asian families. They should realise the  consequences of what /they are doing. In their  desperate scramble for lost support they are 

 engineering community in tolerance by advocating  discrimination.

 The rhetoric does not match the facts. There is no  discrimination. There are changes. There is an  increase in the proportion of Asian arrivals and a  decrease in the proportion of European arrivals. The absolute numbers s t i l l  show that the 

 traditional sources of settlers are s t i l l  the 

 largest sources. These changes are the results of  enlightened and humanitarian policies put together  by previous conservative governments with the 

 support of all political parties. [3]

 As "The Australian" editorial was headed: 

 AUSTRALIA M UST NOT BECOM E A N  UGLY PLACE TO LIVE.

 But we will if the facts and their causes are 

 ignored and replaced by wild politically-motivatec  irrationality.

 I don't believe those who have made accusations of  bias are in themselves racist.

 The danger is that the consequences of their 

 rhetoric will be to fan those underground elements  of racism and prejudice. The result will be the 

 emergence of every bigot from the woodwork. Every  fruitcake in the country will ooze from their 

 slimy corners to gain a piece of the revolting, 

 action which is racial intolerance. That process  inspires some ugly memories of past prejudice and  discrimination.

 This nation was enlightened enough to put an  overdue end to discrimination in the 1970's . W e  recognised that a person is a person regardless of  their colour, creed or nationality.

 All that will be undone unless those who believe  their political hides are worth saving come to 

 their senses and see the consequences of their  actions.

 I commend the words of an anonymous philosopher to  those who are tempted to go - even a l i t t l e  way -  down this stinking track. He said as he 

 contemplated eternity while very i l l ,  "I know not  what record of sin awaits me in the other world  but this I do know . . .  that during my lifetime I 

 was never evil enough to despise a person because  they were poor, because they were ignorant or  because the colour of their skin was different to  mine".
