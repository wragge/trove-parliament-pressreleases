     Whither (Wither!) the

  Administrative

  Appeals Tribunal

  

  The AIAL Twilight Seminar Address by the Hon. 
Justice Jane Mathews, President, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Wednesday, 
5 August 1998.

  

  In July 1994 I became the President of the Commonwealth Admin istrative 
Appeals Tribunal. Before then, as you know, I was a Judge in the New 
South Wales state system, and in common with many other people in the 
state system I knew shamefully little about the functions and operations 
of the AAT. What I found, to my excitement was a dynamic forward-looking 
institution comprising highly skilled people with diverse backgrounds, 
all of them deeply committed to the goals of the organisation. The goals 
themselves were, and remain, formidable: the accountability of Government; 
the transparency of Government decision-making processes; improving 
the quality of Government decision-making; not to mention protecting 
the citizen from arbitrary, capricious and unfair Government actions 
and decisions. 

  

 The organisation which I joined in 1994 was well in 
advance of the courts in a number of crucial areas, one of them being 
accessibility for under privileged groups. It had then and still has 
an unrivalled outreach system to provide assistance and support for 
unrepresented parties. It had a highly developed and sophisticated system 
of professional development for Tribunal members. It had led the field 
in utilising alternative dispute resolution techniques, and also in 
exploring non-adversarial means of conducting hearings. 

  

 For much of this the AAT has its previous presidents 
to thank. It has been suggested by some critics that the fact that the 
President is a Federal Court judge has meant that the Tribunal has adopted 
an excessively court-like stance. I shall be saying more about this 
type of criticism later. Even if there were any foundation for it, it 
would, in my view, be more than out shadowed both by the status which 
the AAT has enjoyed by reason of its presidents being judges, and more 
particularly by the very significant contribution which each individual 
president has made to the organisation. In particular, the AAT was extraordinarily 
fortunate in having, as its first President, Sir Gerard Brennan who, 
with characteristic wisdom, set about establishing a jurisprudence for 
the Tribunal which endures to this day. And it must be said that the 
AAT has made a significant impact upon Government decision-making over 
a very wide area. It has developed broad principles of administration 
which have provided guidance to Government departments and has assisted 
in maintaining an open and fair administration. 

  

 One of the unique features of the AAT, which has contributed 
greatly to its forward-looking culture, is its system of specialist 
members. There is an extraordinary diversity in skills and experience 
amongst this membership. They provide expertise in areas such as medicine, 
accountancy, engineering, aviation, pharmacy; business and Government 
administration, social work, the armed services and many more. Some 
are retired, but many remain in active practice. The one feature which 
they all share is a deep commitment to the organisation and to all that 
it stands for. They enhance the AAT not only through sitting on individual 
cases, but by unstintingly devoting their skills and experience towards 
the corporate growth of the organisation. 

  

 In short, the organisation which I joined in 1994 
was the centrepiece of a cohesive, comprehensive system of administrative 
review which had been in existence for 18 years, and which had gained 
an enviable and justifiable reputation as a world leader. Why is it, 
then, four years later, that the AAT as we know it is facing demise, 
to be replaced by an institution which many fear will lack the essential 
features of a high quality, independent merits review body. 

  

 One thing that has happened in the meantime is that 
the Administrative Review Council brought out its   Better Decisions Report _ following its review of Commonwealth 
merits review tribunals. As President of the AAT, I was (and still am) 
an ex officio member of the ARC, and was closely involved in the formulation 
and preparation of the   Better Decisions Report . Obviously there were some aspects 
of it which involved compromise, both for myself and for other members 
of the Council. But we were all in general agreement as to the overall 
thrust of the report. This included Chapter 8, the chapter which recommended 
that there be fundamental structural changes to the merits review system 
and that the various merits review tribunals be combined into a new 
organisation to be called the Administrative Review Tribunal or the 
ART. The ART was to have seven first tier divisions: the welfare rights 
division, the veterans' payments division, the migration division, the 
commercial and major taxation division, the small taxation claims division, 
the security division and the general division, comprising the residual 
jurisdictions of the AAT. The Report recommended that the ART should 
also be able to convene review panels in order to deal, at first instance, 
with particularly complex cases or cases raising issues of general principle, 
and also to review decisions made by divisional panels where the case 
raises a principle of general significance, where the decision involved 
a manifest error of fact or law that is likely to have materially affected 
the decision, and where new information has become available which could 
not reasonably have been discovered prior to the finalisation of the 
case before the ART division.

  

  The   Better 
Decisions Report _ was released in September 1995. This was followed 
by the holding of a number of public meetings and consultations at which 
interested people expressed their views. I think it is fair to say that 
the report received general commendation, although some aspects of it 
were singled out for particular criticism, such as the suggestion that 
legal qualifications should not be a prerequisite for membership of 
the ART.

  

 The AAT did what it could to implement the recommendations 
in the   Better 
Decisions Report _ which were within its power. The implementation 
of Chapter 8 was plainly a matter for Government. And nothing appeared 
to be happening until, in March 1997, the Attorney-General issued a 
press release saying that Cabinet had made an in-principle decision 
to implement Chapter 8 of   Better Decisions , and to amalgamate all existing merits review 
tribunals into a new tribunal to be called the ART. The implementation 
of this decision, the Attorney announced, was to be undertaken by an 
interdepartmental committee consisting of representatives of Prime Minister 
and Cabinet, and the departments of the Attorney-General, Finance, Social 
Security, Immigration and Veterans' Affairs. An unlikely lot of bedfellows 
if ever there was one. At that stage it was anticipated that the IDC 
would report back to Cabinet in June 1997. As we all know, June came 
and went without a word emanating from the IDC. Indeed the IDC was particularly 
secretive about the whole process. No external consultation whatsoever 
took place, neither with the tribunals involved nor, more importantly, 
with the ARC, notwithstanding that the ARC's statutory functions include 
advising the Minister on matters relating to administrative review.

  

 The shroud of secrecy surrounding the IDC's deliberations 
was not sufficient to prevent the leaking of some disturbing information. 
We were told by the media that the process had been commandeered by 
the head of Prime Minister and Cabinet, a gentleman who was not particularly 
sympathetic to the causes of administrative review. The new tribunal, 
it was proposed, would be under the control of a management committee 
which would include the heads of the main Government departments whose 
decisions were subject to review. What sort of independence was this 
to be? There followed an outpouring of concern, as you will remember, 
from a wide group of people and organisations. Indeed I was very impressed 
and not a little surprised at the extent and the breadth of the criticism, 
and the very responsible way that some sections of the media took up 
the issue. The Government was evidently less impressed. The Attorney-General 
issued a press release saying that there would be no compromise on the 
independence of the new tribunal. Thereafter the Attorney-General's 
Department took over the running of the IDC. This did not however lead 
to any further consultation. The tribunals such as the AAT were asked 
to provide statistical and other information to the IDC but were at 
no time consulted about the viability or workability of the proposals 
it was working on. It was not until March of this year, 12 months after 
the Attorney's initial press release, that the matter went back to Cabinet 
and we were then favoured with our first insight into what the Government 
had in mind. This was in the form of a consultation paper put out by 
the Attorney-General's Department, in the middle of March, seeking submissions 
by the end of April Ã a six week period after 12 months deliberation 
within the IDC. Moreover we were frankly told, by officers in the Attorney-General's 
Department, that the major features of the proposal, having already 
been decided by Cabinet, were not negotiable.

  

 At present we are, it seems, in the implementation 
phase, with the Attorney-General's Department having the running of 
the transition. Significant legislative change will be involved if it 
is to proceed. Not only will it necessitate the repeal of the AAT Act, 
but also the amendment of some 300 Commonwealth statutes which provide 
for AAT review. All of this still seems a long way off. Nothing appears 
to be happening very fast. Indeed the implementation date keeps shifting 
backwards. At present it is sometime in early 2000.

  

  I return to the substance of the proposal. And I must preface what 
I am about to say by emphasising that neither the AAT nor I are against 
change in itself. I was, after all, a signatory to the   Better Decisions Report _ and as most people within the AAT 
agree, if the current proposals were indeed in implementation of the   Better Decisions 
Report , we would have no cause for complaint. Anxiety amongst 
our membership, whose future careers are in doubt, we would certainly 
have. But we would not be able to suggest that the proposed amalgamation 
constituted such a downgrading of the merits review system as to fundamentally 
threaten the quality and independence of external merits review.

  

 Unfortunately there are many respects in which the 
current proposals differ significantly from the   Better Decisions  _ recommendations. An obvious and glaring 
one is the absence from the proposed ART of the Veterans' Review Board. 
This Tribunal will continue in its current form, with the ART providing 
second tier review of its decisions in much the same way as the AAT 
does now. There is no good reason, in principle or practice, as to why 
the VRB should be excluded from the amalgamation of tribunals. The explanation 
for it is obvious: the veterans' organisations constitute such a powerful 
lobby group that they succeeded in persuading the Government to maintain 
the status quo for their own. But in the process the primary rationale 
for undertaking this whole exercise has been effectively undermined.

  

 The divisions of the ART as currently proposed are:   
â¢ The Immigration and Refugee Division;   
â¢ The Income Support Division;   
â¢ The Taxation Division (including the STCT);   
â¢ The Compensation Division;   
â¢ The Veterans' Appeals Division; and   
â¢ The Commercial and General Division.

  

 Other than the fact that Veterans' Appeals Division 
will now do only second tier review of VRB decisions, there is no very 
significant difference between these divisions and those proposed in   Better Decisions . 
The differences of substance - and thus the problems - lie elsewhere. 

  

 They lie particularly in the proposals which relate 
to the funding of the organisation, in its proposed membership structure, 
and in how it will deal with new evidence. I must say a little about 
each of these, for they are all of vital importance. 

  

 First the funding. Since the early 1990s the AAT has 
obtained its funding by a single allocation from the Department of Finance 
with a built-in workload formula in order to accommodate to fluctuating 
workloads. This system has worked very well. It has provided the AAT 
with clear independence and autonomy from Government. It gives the organisation 
complete control over the allocation of its funds, with resultant flexibility 
and efficiency. The ARC, in   Better Decisions , recommended that review tribunal funding 
should generally proceed according to this model. The Council recommended 
that funding should not be provided from line agencies, being agencies 
whose decisions are to be reviewed by the tribunal. It saw this primarily 
as an independence issue. However, in direct opposition to this approach, 
the Government is now proposing that the ART should be funded from the 
running costs of the very departments whose decisions are to be reviewed 
by the specialist divisions. In other words the Department of Social 
Security will fund the Income Support Division, the Australian Taxation 
Office will fund the Taxation Division, Department of Veterans' Affairs 
will fund the Veterans' Appeals Division, Department of Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs will fund the Immigration and Refugee Division 
and most of the balance will be funded through the Attorney-General's 
Department. Not only does this involve a very significant independence 
issue, at least in perception and possibly also in practice, but it 
threatens to create a bureaucratic nightmare. The current funding model 
will require the President of the ART to negotiate and enter into at 
least seven separate funding agreements with seven different agencies, 
each of them based on workload formulas, but with no certainty of consistency 
as to how they are based. The ART will then be required to account to 
at least seven different agencies as to the expenditure of these funds. 
Seven different sets of accounts will have to be kept based on the workload 
statistics of the different divisions. The Government proposes that 
there should be cross-appointment of members between the divisions -- 
a sensible proposal, particularly in the smaller registries such as 
Darwin and Perth. But how do you then allocate member costs between 
the different funding agencies? And how do you allocate the funding 
for shared registry staff and services? The president and the executive 
members of this organisation will, I fear, be spending the bulk of their 
time dealing with unwieldy and difficult financial matters, all of which 
could have been avoided had the simple funding scheme proposed by the 
ARC been adopted. Not to mention, as I have said, the very significant 
independence issues which are likely to be involved.

  

  The AAT pointed out these difficulties in its submissions on the current 
proposals. However as I understand it, the Government is standing firm 
on this issue. I regard this as a matter of great concern.

  

  So I turn to the matter of membership. Appointment  is a significant 
issue. The ARC had recommended that the minister with portfolio responsibility 
for the ART generally, namely the Attorney-General or the Prime Minister, 
should have primary responsibility for the appointment of members, albeit 
that this would be exercised jointly with line ministers. However again 
the current proposal does not reflect the ARC recommendation. It proposes 
that appointments to divisions other than the commercial and general 
division be made on the recommendation of the minister in charge of 
the line department. This was taken up by the AAT in its submission 
to Government. Notwithstanding an apparently transparent merit based 
selection process, we are concerned that giving line portfolio ministers 
the power to appoint ART members might well have an adverse affect upon 
the actual and perceived independence of the appointment process and 
therefore of the tribunal itself.

  

 However by far the greatest cause for concern in relation 
to members is the proposed membership structure. The AAT is a very hierarchical 
organisation, but when one appreciates the diversity of its workload 
one realises that there are very good reasons for this. The ARC also 
recognised this, and recommended in Chapter 8 of   Better Decisions _ that membership of the ART should comprise 
a president, deputy presidents, senior members and members Ã the same 
membership structure as prevails in the AAT at present. The current 
Government proposal envisages, first, a president, who will be selected 
on the basis of "professional and management expertise" and 
who will be the chief executive officer of the ART. There will be no 
requirement that this CEO be a judge or former judge, and I think I 
can safely say that there would be very few judges or former judges 
who would be tempted by the position. Each division is to be headed 
by an executive member who will have day-to-day responsibility for the 
management of the division. Otherwise, the current proposal is for there 
to be a flat membership structure at a level which will almost certainly 
be very significantly lower than existing senior members of the AAT, 
let alone deputy presidents. Indeed the Government proposal suggests 
that "the qualifications for ART membership should usually be the 
same as those for primary decision-makers in the relevant jurisdictions. 
This reflects", the proposal goes on, "the fact that members 
are administrative decision-makers not pseudo judges". Where, one 
may ask, will be the improvement in Government decision-making? In particular, 
who in the ART will be able to deal with the complex commercial, taxation 
and other high level cases which regularly come before the AAT? Certainly 
neither the president nor the executive members will have time for sitting 
on these cases. Their administrative responsibilities will be so onerous 
that it is difficult to see them having much time for any hearings at 
all.

  

 I have been vociferous about this matter since the 
proposal emerged, and I think that some people in the Attorney-General's 
Department now understand the problem. However I have little confidence 
that adequate steps will be taken to address this issue, which I see 
as having the capacity to significantly undermine the ability of the 
new tribunal to deal effectively with its caseload.

  

  A further matter of real co ncern relates to the current proposals 
as to how the ART is to deal with new evidence. As you all know, it 
is a fundamental precept of merits review that hearings are   de novo _ and that the tribunal reaches the correct or preferable 
decision based on the evidence as presented before it. The evidence 
which was before the primary decision-maker is irrelevant. The current 
proposal makes the point that it is preferable for decisions to be made 
at the earliest, lowest and cheapest level, and no one can cavil with 
that. However it proceeds to recommend that where new evidence is produced 
before the ART, the presumption will be that the matter is to be referred 
back to the primary decision-maker as the subject of a fresh application. 
The tribunal member will have a discretion to take account of the new 
evidence only where this will bring about a more efficient and speedy 
resolution of the matter and both parties agree to that course. The 
ping-ponging bureaucratic nightmare that this recommendation, if implemented, 
would produce can barely be imagined. Indeed this treatment of new evidence 
is directly contrary to other aspects of the proposal which suggest 
that the ART should be inquisitorial in its proceedings. The fundamental 
purpose of inquisitorial proceedings is to bring out all material evidence, 
whether it be new or otherwise. The two proposals simply cannot stand 
together.

  

  It has to be said that the officers of the Attorney-General's Department 
now realise that this recommendation would cause very significant practical 
problems, and it is likely that this proposal will not proceed in its 
present form. But what will replace  it we still do not know. 
And the attitude which finds expression in this proposal is very worrying 
indeed. It represents a clear attempt by Government to retreat from 
the broad basis of merits review as we know it.

  

 There are other aspects of the current proposal which 
cause real concern. The whole tenor of the proposal has been described, 
with some justification, as being anti-lawyer, not only in terms of 
membership qualifications but also in terms of representation of parties. 
The proposal expresses concern that the participation of legal representatives 
can result in tribunal proceedings becoming unnecessarily legalistic 
and drawn out. It proposes that, except where portfolio legislation 
specifies otherwise, the expectation is that representation before the 
ART will only be allowed in exceptional or prescribed circumstances.

  

 Overall, the proposal displays a worrying lack of 
understanding as to the practical operation of the tribunal system. 
This is hardly a surprise, given the history of the matter and the fact 
that the proposal was developed, behind closed doors, by people with 
no personal involvement at all in the operation or administration of 
tribunals.

  

 In short, the current proposal is not what the ARC 
had in mind when it recommended an amalgamation of tribunals in the   Better Decisions 
Report , notwithstanding the Attorney-General's justification 
of the proposals by reference to that report.

  

 Why is this happening? The clear philosophy behind 
all this is that the AAT is too adversarial, formal and legalistic and 
that this adds significantly to the cost of merits review. The proposals, 
it is said, are designed to streamline administrative structures and 
to produce a more user-friendly tribunal at a lower cost to the taxpayer.

  

 If this could be achieved without fundamentally undermining 
the independence and quality of the new organisation, we would have 
no cause for complaint. But this does not at present appear to be the 
case. And I must say something about this type of criticism of the AAT. 
This criticism has been around for a long time now. I was conscious 
of it when I first came to the AAT four years ago, and one of my primary 
aims ever since has been to reduce levels of formality and to promote 
flexibility of procedures. Flexibility has to be the answer in an organisation 
with the diversity of workload of the AAT. Adversarial procedures work 
well for complex difficult cases involving significant issues or large 
sums of money where both parties are represented by experienced lawyers. 
They are inappropriate in cases at the other end of the spectrum, such 
as those involving unrepresented applicants where the issues are simple 
and not of any general significance.

  

 I may be biased, but I think that, to a large extent 
the AAT has achieved the sort of flexibility which enables it to deal 
appropriately with its workload. Limitations of course remain. The supervisory 
position taken by the Federal Court, and the architectural structure 
of our hearing rooms are two of these. And there will always be room 
for improvement. However in general the criticism of the AAT which underlies 
the current proposals is in my view based on an outmoded and no longer 
accurate view of the tribunal and its operations.

  

 What then is to be gained through this amalgamation? 
Clearly there are real efficiencies to be derived from sharing registry 
functions, IT systems and other supporting services. However the amalgamation 
process, in the short-term, will cost the taxpayer additional money 
and it is difficult to see it producing significant savings in the long-term. 
My real concern is that, if implemented, there will be very limited 
benefit to the community and very great cost, in terms of both the quality 
and the independence of external merits review.
