 DIAC outreach officers to visit Central Coast 

 Wednesday, 29 August 2007 

 Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  (DIAC) will be on the Central Coast soon for a regional outreach  visit. 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the  outreach trips were a great way for people in regional areas to sit  down and talk about immigration-related issues face-to-face with  DIAC officers. 

 'The Australian Government places great importance on  providing services to regional areas and these visits are a large  part of that,' Mr Andrews said. 

 'These appointments attract a range of people, from small  business owners to farmers, community groups to individuals,  who might want information or just someone to talk them through  a complex matter. 

 'While the department has a great deal of information available  over the phone or on the Internet, some people prefer to speak to  officers face-to-face, and these visits are about meeting that  need.  

 'In the past, the most popular topics related to citizenship, work  visas, visas for family members and how to propose and sponsor  refugees,' the Minister added. 

 The DIAC team will be at the Wyong TAFE (building C, room  1.13), Porter Street, Wyong on Wednesday, September 19.  An  information session will begin at 9.30am with consultations taking  place from 10.30am to 5pm. Bookings should be made through  the Central Coast Multicultural Project on 4323 7483.
