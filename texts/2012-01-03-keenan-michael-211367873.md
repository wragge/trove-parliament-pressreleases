 Doorstop Interview

 Posted on Tuesday, 3 January, 2012

 E&OE…………………………

 Topics: Government/Coalition talks, Proven Coalition Policy, Labor Incompetence, Boat Arrivals,  People Smuggling & UNHCR Intake. 

 Question 

 Michael, two boats overnight - does this reinforce the need for both sides to come together for offshore  processing? 

 Michael Keenan 

 What it reinforces the need for is for the Labor Party to find a solution to the problem that they created.  We are very happy to continue to talk to the government in good faith but we continue to stick to the  policies that we know actually work. We know those policies work because we’ve actually used them in  the past to stop people smuggling - those policies were a return to offshore processing on the Island of  Nauru, and also on Manus Island if required. A return to temporary protection visas because that takes  away one of the most serious planks that the people smugglers have to sell which is permanent  residence to Australia and also turning the boats back around when it is safe and appropriate to do so.  What Australia needs is a solution to the border protection crisis that the government has created. That  solution is available to them but they need to have the resolve to embrace the policies they are proven  to work and have been proven to work in the past when Australia faced exactly the same situation  about ten years ago. 

 Question 

 Michael the situation has been exhausted now - isn’t it time for both sides just to reach a compromise? 

 Michael Keenan 

 Well we are very happy to talk to the government in good faith but what we need from any talks is not a  compromise for the sake of it but what we need is a solution - that is actually what’s required. The  solution is the same as it was 4 years ago when Labor came to office, it’s the same as it was 3 years  ago when Labor abolished offshore processing and temporary protection visas and provided the kiss of  life to people smugglers. The solution is to go back to the policies that we have used that have been  proven to stop people smuggling. 

 Question 

 What is happening with the talks? Is Scott Morrison meeting with Chris Bowen this week? 

 Michael Keenan 

 I’m not in a position to provide a running commentary on any talks or negotiations and those questions  are best put to the Government. 

 Question 

 But surely - obviously you guys are supposed to be coming up with some sort of negotiated agreement  according to the government - what are you guys trying to do to try and help get there? Or has it all  collapsed? 

 Michael Keenan 

 I can’t provide any commentary on those negotiations and I suggest that those questions are best put  to the Labor Party. Our position is exactly the same as it was a year ago; it’s exactly the same as it  was 5 years ago; it’s exactly the same as it was a decade ago - we know what works, we know what  works because we’ve actually used it in the past to get results and return some integrity to Australia’s  immigration system. We need to go back to those policies - offshore processing on Nauru, a return to  temporary protection visas and turning the boats back around when it is safe and appropriate to do so. 

 Question 

 In the meantime and as these negotiations continue - and these people continue to come to our  shores - at what point - after how long this goes on for - at what point are you willing to give a little? 

 Michael Keenan 

 We are always happy to talk in good faith but as I said what we need is actually a solution - the  solution is obvious because it has existed in the past - the solution that we propose is one that we  have used to get the results that Australia actually requires. The reason we are in this present situation  is because Labor abolished that solution when they came to office. We need to return to those  policies - that will 

 stop the boats from coming - that will tackle people smuggling and that’s been proven to work in the  past. 

 Question 

 What about increasing our intake from Indonesia - those who have been directly processed from the  UNHCR, should we be doing that? 

 Michael Keenan 

 I’m not aware that that would be part of any conversation. We have a refugee intake that is very  generous by any international standard - we take 13,750 people on any given year. On a per capita  basis the most generous refugee program in the world. We certainly support that program and it has  had bipartisan support for a long time. Any discussions about increasing it - we’d obviously be happy  to have those discussions but ultimately we already have a very generous program existing. 

 Question 

 How concerning is it that the boats keep coming when it’s monsoon season and when we’ve already  seen bad weather on Christmas Island? How concerning is that in terms of safety? 

 Michael Keenan 

 It is an enormous concern - Australian’s have been reminded just recently with that terrible tragedy off  Java about how dangerous a voyage this is, it was just over a year ago that we had those terrible  pictures from Christmas Island with the boat floundering on the rocks. Whilst people smugglers bring  people to Australia, there is absolutely no question that people will continue to die taking that journey.  By some estimates 4 per cent of the people who attempt this crossing are lost and of course that also  would involve boats that we hear anecdotal reports of leaving Indonesia and never being heard from or  seen of again. This is an incredibly dangerous journey at any time of the year - it is particularly bad at  this time of the year with those severe weather patterns that we can get in the north of Australia and  that it why it is vitally important from any sort of humanitarian perspective to actually stop people

 Have there been any more written offers between Labor and the Coalition over the Christmas New  Year’s period? 

 Michael Keenan 

 I’m not in a position to make any comment on those negotiations but I do suggest that you put those  questions to the Labor Party. 

 Question 

 What about if we want to get it from your side? Are you suggesting we go to Tony Abbott or to Scott? 

 Michael Keenan 

 What I’m suggesting is that the Coalition is not in a position to comment any further about it or provide  any sort of commentary about those negotiations. It’s really up to the government to inform the public  about its proposals - they are the ones that created this problem in the first place. Our position is  exactly the same as it has been for a decade - we haven’t changed and it’s our position because we  know it works. 

 Question 

 You say that the trip is dangerous - are both side not just wasting time? Is it more important to you that  negotiations continue rather than just putting something in place now just to stop it? 

 Michael Keenan 

 It’s not at all - there is no point in negotiating unless we get an outcome and of course the outcome is  that we go back to policies that work. Our position is exactly the same as it always has been - it hasn’t  changed and the position is based on sound evidence of what has actually worked in the past. We are  very happy to talk to the government but the point is to get a solution that actually works and the  solution that works is to send the message to people smugglers that Australia is closed for business. 

 Question 

 How much of a deterrent would Nauru be though - when you’ve seen people prepared to put their lives  at risk - you’ve seen that some of the people from the Java crash are reportedly going to try again - how would Nauru work when they’ve got nothing to lose - they’ve lost family, they say they can’t return  to their country - why would Nauru be a deterrent? 

 Michael Keenan 

 Well it’s not just Nauru - Nauru would be one plank of a successful program. Nauru plus temporary  protection visas plus turning the boats back around when it is safe and appropriate to do so - that’s a  solution. So Nauru by itself is certainly not the answer but Nauru in conjunction with the other suite of  policies is certainly the way forward. 

 Question 

 Is there any real prospect of both sides coming to an actual agreement on this? 

 Michael Keenan 

 Our position is exactly the same as it always has been; if the government is prepared to adopt  successful policies then we could get an agreement tomorrow. We would be very happy with that - that would be a good outcome for the country and it would send the message to the people smugglers 

 that Australia is just not a soft touch for them anymore. 

 Question 

 But why would Nauru in itself be a positive outcome? 

 Michael Keenan 

 Nauru in itself is not a positive outcome we actually need to return to that suite of policies. The  Government has indicated that they are prepared to look at Nauru and that’s certainly something that  we welcome but they need to do it in conjunction with temporary protection visas. The product that  people smugglers sell is a very lucrative product and that is permanent residence to Australia. So that  is why TPVs remain so vitally important. We also need to turn boats back around - that was the Labor  Party’s policy prior to the last election but they didn’t have the resolve and the courage to actually  implement it in government. It is those three policies that are going to form a suite of policies that stop  people smuggling. 

 Question 

 Don’t TPVs just mean they you get more women and children because you can’t have the family rights  when you get permanency - so you’ve got women and kids increasingly getting on boats? 

 Michael Keenan 

 No - TPVs mean that people can’t get on a boat and come to Australia and stay here on a permanent  basis. They mean that we will extend protection to people who require it as is our international  obligation but if the conditions change in their homeland as we’ve seen in countries such as Sri Lanka,  then we expect it as reasonable that you could return home. The product that people smugglers  market in the Middle East - people actually have a whole suite of options about where they might go - it’s permanent residence to Australia and TPVs deny them that.
