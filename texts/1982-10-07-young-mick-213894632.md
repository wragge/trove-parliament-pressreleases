 From the Press ...

 A snippet from a letter in this week's Australian by  one of the Minister's fellow-Queenslanders seems to  compliment Mr Hodges' statement at the National  Language Policy Conference:

 "The fact is that,  perhaps sooner than we think,  the whole world will become more or less mono­ lingual, if not monocultural.

 There is only one growth language in the world  and that is English. When the British  coloured half the world red, then retreated  they left English behind them.

 English is everybody's second language ... I  get on just fine with my fellow Europeans and  with Asians, but I think that artificial force­ feeding of migrant children with their left - 

 behind cultures and traditions is a retrograde  and divisive step." The Minister would do well to note where such views  stem from and where they lead, as this letter amply 

 illustrates.

 Journalists, broadcasters or other individuals  should feel free to reproduce any article. An  acknowledgement is not necessary,  but would be  appreciated.

 ”IN OTHER W O R D S ” From MICK VOL NG M r Shadow Minister for Immigration   and Ethnic Affairs

 No. 7, October 1982

 Editorial -Minister for Immigration 8 Ethnic Affairs

 Alienates Ethnic Communities

 The Minister for Immigration 8 Ethnic Affairs, after  six months in that portfolio, has finally shown his  true colours.  That is, at heart Mr Hodges is an  assimilation!st.  By holding on to this anachron­

 istic view, the Minister not only shows himself to  be out of step with the ethnic communities of  Australia and with officers of his own Department,   but even with the Prime Minister. Mr Fraser,  who 

 for the past 7 years has carefully courted the  ethnic vote by his diligent promotion of multi-  culturalism, must have received a serious setback  when his own Minister for Ethnic Affairs addressed 

 the first National Language Policy of Australia in  Canberra on 22 October.

 Addressing several hundred representatives of  Australia's immigrant,  refugee and Aboriginal  communities and language professionals,  Mr Hodges  suggested that a National Language Policy would

 2.

 be as irrelevant as a National Music Policy.

 Mr Hodges was representing the Prime Minister and  first read the Prime Minister's message to the  Conference. Evidently, Mr Hodges either did not  notice or did not care that his own speech contrad­

 icted the Prime Minister's message.

 Although Mr Hodges claimed to be "as visionary as  possible" when considering the subject of languages  for Australians,  he made it abundantly clear that  his concern in this area still rests on the old 

 assimilationist principles.  Teaching English to  migrants is the narrow,  rather than the visionary  goal. Denying that language policy would benefit  all Australians,  he exposed his angle-ethnocentrism 

 by claiming that languages other than English were  "unnecessary".

 He further argued that Australia had achieved the  major goals of multiculturalism without a national  policy and foreshadowed that his Government would  simply not free resources for such a project. Many 

 ethnic groups, especially Aboriginals whose  languages face extinction in the world unless some  efforts are made to maintain them, would take issue  with the Minister on this.

 I think that it is a great pity indeed that  Mr Hodges, as Minister for Immigration Î¾ Ethnic  Affairs,  is so out of touch with the views of the  communities for which his portfolio makes him 

 responsible. Therefore,  I have urged the Minister  to reconsider his views on this subject and to  consult more fully with ethnic communities and 

 other people who are concerned about this matter.

 How are they to save the bond money they will need,  when they have to move out of the hostels?

 It is doubtful that if Mr Newman, the Minister for  Administrative Services, considered migrants' needs  when he approved the hostels taking not only the  whole of the $6.40 increase,  but an additional 

 $3.10. One would think that it is the responsib­ ility of Senator Chaney, as Minister for Social  Security,  to ensure that migrants and refugees,  whose sole income are social security benefits,

 are not fleeced by his Ministerial colleagues.  * * * * *

 The Commonwealth Games

 On 30 September,  the Brisbane Games got off to an  emotional start with all the pomp and pageantry  befitting such a royal occasion, to the tunes of  patriotic "schmaltz", and the inevitable Australiana  kitsch. To give the Queensland Government its due,  an attempt was made to portray Australia as a 

 "multicultural society": for a few minutes, dance  groups from 17 ethnic backgrounds (about half of  them non-Commonwealth) held hands inside a giant  map of Australia,  created by those marvellous  Brisbane school children, and swayed to the strains  of Peter Allen's syrupy "I Still Call Australia  Home".

 That collection of national dancers also included  black Australians: one dance group from Arnhem  Land and one from the Torres Strait Islands. To be  included in that colourful display of ethnic groups 

 seems to be their only rightful cultural claim as  far as the Queensland Government is concerned.  How­ ever, black Australians and their white supporters 

 staged several non-violent demonstrations outside  the great sport arenas,  capturing the interest of  many overseas media representatives,  especially  those from Africa.

 I take this opportunity to express my congratulations  to the many fine Australian athletes, who did such a  wonderful job at the Commonwealth Games. Quite a  few of them, of course, are ethnic Australians.

 Mr Hodges also said that these operations had the  support of the Opposition. He failed to mention, how­ ever, my often-stated misgivings over his method of  detection and the way in which the Government is man­

 ipulating the issue of "illegals" to explain  unemployment.  * * * * *

 Government takes migrant payment rises - and more

 While the Government professes to have a concern for  new settlers,  its policies towards refugees and  migrants in hostels show how little concern there 

 really is.

 From next month, migrants and refugees in Common­ wealth hostels will lose the rise in their social  security payments introduced by the 1982 Budget.

 Most new arrivals are on unemployment,  sickness or  special benefit. At present, if they are single they  keep $25.55 out of their $58.10 a week benefit,  while  the hostel takes $32.55. If they are married, they  keep $50.50 of their $123.60 benefit, while the 

 hostel takes $73.10.

 New instructions have been received in the Department  of Social Security that from the beginning of Novem­ ber, when pensions and benefits are increased, hos­ tels will be snatching back a great deal more of  their social security cheques:  if they are single,  the new benefit rate is $64.40, of which the hostel  will take $42.95 a week,  while the migrant keeps only 

 $21.45. If married,  the new rate is $128.80, of  which the hostel will take $85.85, while the couple  will have only $42.95 a week between them.

 The proportion the migrant is allowed to keep of his  or her social security payment has dropped from 44%  to 33%, with the hostel’s cut going up to 671.

 Questions raised in relation to this by Senator Don  Grimes,  Shadow Minister for Social Security,  included  the following:

 How are new arrivals expected to cover clothing,  transport,  telephone and other costs, including  those associated with job seeking, on $21.45 a  week?

 Overseas Recruitment of Tradesmen - Recruitment  for the Dole Queue?

 The "Big Australian" is in serious trouble, esp­ ecially as far as the steel industry is concerned. The company is now planning to retrench thousands  of workers in its Newcastle, Wollongong and Whyalla  plants. BHP blames the problems of the steel 

 industry on the international economy, but the root  cause of them is the Fraser Government’s disastrous  monetarist policy. This contradictory policy has  produced the crippling interest rates that have 

 crushed the construction industry in Australia and  led to a substantial decline in the demand for  products of BHP's steel plants. The situation has  been further aggravated by BHP's failure to 

 adequately update and improve efficiency.

 It is the workers in this industry that are now  being forced to bear the brunt of this mismanagement.  Families in Wollongong and Newcastle have been told  that nobody's job can be regarded as safe,  but it is 

 the "last on - first off" policy of retrenchment  that has thrown the ball into the court of the  immigration area.  At least as late as 18 months  ago, BHP placed advertisements in British newspapers  asking for experienced boilermakers, welders,   sheet metal workers,  etc.  And as late as 2 months  ago, tradesmen from Britain arrived in Australia  to work in BHP steel plants. They had left their  jobs in Britain,  sold houses or gave up flats, up­  rooted their families ... all in the search for  the "good life" in the "lucky country". Now they  are facing the dole queue.  Their dreams of the 

 good life are turning into nightmares,  especially  for those people with young families and house  mortgages.

 Naturally, the tradesmen affected by the BHP decision  to lay off workers feel extremely let down by the  company. The ones I spoke to like Australia, they  want to stay here and build a future for themselves 

 and their children, and they want to work. Surely,  they said, since BHP lured us to Australia with

 4.

 promises of five years' continuous employment,  BHP has  a responsibility toward us. They don't want special  treatment, but justice and fair compensation for the  sacrifices they made in coming here.

 Apparently, when trade union officials discussed this  issue with BHP, they were assured that overseas re­ cruitment had stopped, and that the company would do  the right thing by those tradesmen already here. Now  it would seem that BHP has reneged on this, as a  recent "60 Minutes" program clearly pointed out.  Management does not feel any responsibility towards 

 those workers at all. Most of the tradesmen have  already been told to start looking for another job.

 Finding another job is, of course, almost impossible.  According to the "Occupation Demand Schedule" used by  the Department for Immigration Î¾ Ethnic Affairs to  determine labour shortages, metal trades workers are 

 in short supply in all Australian States. However,  this does not correspond to reality. Commonwealth  Employment Offices, particularly in the Wollongong  and Newcastle areas, do not record vacancies in the  metal trades at the moment. The Department's 

 schedule, by admission of DIEA officers, is at least  12 months out of date. This means that intending  immigrants with qualifications in the metal trades 

 applying for visas now will still receive a high  point score in the migrant selection scheme and are  encouraged to come here.

 One boilermaker who recently came here to settle with  relatives near Newcastle only to find that he could  not get a job decided to complain to immigration  authorities in Britain about the false information he  was given on job prospects. The reply he received 

 contained the following:

 Australia has always offered opportunities for  skilled tradesmen in the metal trades. I do  hope you persevere and make every effort to  resettle yourself and your family.

 5.

 Such complacency, patronisation and manipulation of  facts is an outrage. It is about time the Govern­ ment looked at the whole labour shortage migration  and job nomination scheme in the light of economic  realities in Australia today. We are dealing with  people here, not statistics on a computer print-out.  Migrants who come to this country should be made 

 aware of the employment difficulties that may await  them. If the Government wishes to persist with re­ cruitment according to the "Occupation Demand  Schedule" greater efforts must be made so that 12  months do not elapse between issuing the schedule 

 and the arrival of the migrant assessed by that  schedule.

 The Fraser Government has failed to shoulder its re­  sponsibilities toward the workers of this country. It has no program for creating jobs. Under the  Fraser Government the level of unemployment has con­ sistently risen and the 1982 Budget forecasts a  further growth in unemployment. Among the number  of the unemployed, a couple of hundred migrant 

 tradesmen brought here by BHP may seem "a drop in  the ocean", but it is a very cynical exercise indeed  to bring people to this country as recruits for the  ever-growing dole queues.

 In Parliament ...

 In answer to a question from a Liberal Party  colleague as to how successful the DIEA's crackdown  on illegal migrants has been so far, the Minister  for Immigration § Ethnic Affairs expressed his 

 satisfaction with the progress. The Department is  doing an excellent job with limited staff, he said.  He went on to explain:

 During the month of September 207 employers  were visited ... (they) have been extremely  helpful. Some 216 prohibited immigrants were  apprehended during the month of September;

 85 departed under supervision; 66 prohibited  immigrants were deported; and 90 overstayers  departed voluntarily ... This is an increase  in excess of 100 per cent on the number usu­ ally detected ÎÎ® a normal month's activities.
