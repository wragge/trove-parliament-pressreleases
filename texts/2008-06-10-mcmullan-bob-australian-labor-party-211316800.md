 MEDIA RELEASE  BOB MCMULLAN MP  PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE  MEMBER FOR FRASER 

 AA0842 10 June 2008 

 Relief in Sight - Australia's International Disaster Response  in Pictures 

 Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, Bob McMullan, has opened  Relief in Sight - a compelling display of 68 photographs reflecting Australia's commitment to  helping people affected by natural disasters and conflict.

 The powerful and poignant images offer a rare insight into the role of volunteers and relief  workers in rebuilding communities after disaster strikes,' Mr McMullan said. 

 Australia is the regional leader in providing critical humanitarian and emergency relief and is  often the first to respond when a natural disaster or crisis strikes the Asia-Pacific region. 

 We recently provided $25 million to Burma after Cyclone Nargis. Around 2.4 million people were  severely affected, and the United Nations estimates that the death toll is over 100,000.

 Our assistance was in the form of food, water, water purification, sanitation, health kits, and  tarpaulins. We are also one of the largest donors to the United Nations Flash Appeal. 

 Australia was instrumental in delivering aid following the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004. We  contributed $71 million to Aceh for initial humanitarian and emergency relief. In addition, Australia  supplied $181 million to restore services and infrastructure, including the main provincial port and  hospital in Banda Aceh.

 In the 2008/09 financial year, the Australian Government will provide $319.6 million to support  humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs,' Mr McMullan said.

 The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) developed Relief in Sight with its  relief partners including Red R Australia, Caritas Australia and Oxfam Australia, and professional  photographers. The exhibition features a series of images of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami by  award-winning Australian photographers Stephen Dupont and Rob MacColl.

 I encourage all Australians to visit the exhibition here in Melbourne and as it tours more than 65  cities and towns to see first hand the importance of Australia's emergency response for people in  our region,' Mr McMullan said.
