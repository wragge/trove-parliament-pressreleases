  LA’W COUNCIL CRITICISM OF THE ADMIXISTRATIVE REVIEW m- --   TRIBUNAL 

  The Law Council of Australia appears to want to retain a slow, legalistic and   unnecessarily adversarial and expensive system of m.erits review that serves to benefit   lawyers more than the people who   see:k an independent review of Government   decisions. 

  The Law Council’s criticisms of the proposed new Administrative Review Tribunal   are self-serving.   The AR1’ will replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security   Appeals Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Migration Review Tribunal.   The legislation to create the ART passed the House of Representatives last week.   The AR1Y will. improve the merits review process by providing a single, independent   tribunal 110 review administrative decisions on their merits. The ART will ensure that   the Imerits review process is more informal, cheaper and faster for applicants than the 

  current system. The Commonwealth’s proposals are: based on the key   recommendations of the Administrative Review Council’s 1995 Better Decisions   report.   The Law Council’s submissions to the: Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee 

  indicate that it wants to retain many of the features that make the present system   unfriendly to users and less accountable than it ought to be. These include an   automatic right to legal representation and no performance appraisal for members.   The Council also wants lawyers to have an unrestricted right to appear before the   ART, while at the same time arguing that restrictions should be placed on the capacity 

  of non-lawye:rs to appear and assist applicants. A tribunal operating under these   arrangements would certainly benefit the legal profession, but this is not the object of   the Government’s reforms. What the Commonwealth wants is what applicants want:   a system that provides fair, impartia:l, accessible and timely decision-:making, with 

  legal representation available where it is needed.   The Commonwealth will consider the Law Council’s submission and the Senate   Committee’s report when it is hande:d down in the new year. However, we do not   intend to overhaul our proposal in a. way that will make: the new system more 

  cumbersome for applicants.
