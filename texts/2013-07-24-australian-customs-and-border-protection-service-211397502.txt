 MEDIA RELEASE  Wednesday, 24 July 2013 

 

 The message is clear: if you come by boat, you won’t be settled in Australia   

 The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) is undertaking a range of offshore  communication activities to inform people considering making the journey to Australia by boat that  the Australian Government’s policy has changed.   

 The ACBPS is working closely with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) to ensure  the message is spread as widely as possible.   

 DIAC’s communication activities are aimed at Australian-based diaspora communities which are  known to be the primary and most trusted source of information and influence among asylum  seeker groups.   

 ACBPS complementary activities are targeting those asylum seeker groups in source and transit  countries with the same message - If you go to Australia by boat without a visa, you won’t be settled  there.   

 ACBPS is using existing commercial arrangements with offshore communication providers for  services in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Middle East to ensure information about the new policy is  communicated quickly and clearly.   

 The multi-million dollar campaign includes a mix of traditional media (television, radio and press  where relevant), social media and other internet-based communication tools such as blogs.   

 Contracted service providers are also engaging directly with groups considering or seeking to travel  to Australia by boat. This includes those groups already in transit to Australia.   

 ACBPS officers in overseas missions in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Papua New  Guinea and India have distributed material from the www.australia.gov.au/novisa website (including  material in local languages) to key stakeholders and media outlets in source and transit countries.   

 ACBPS is also assisting Australia’s overseas missions who are posting Australian Government  announcements on their local internet home pages in both English and local languages, and  engaging with host governments and local media.   

 In Sri Lanka, radio and press advertisements will begin within days. Leaflets and fact sheets  translated into Tamil and Sinhalese will be distributed next week.   

 On behalf of ACBPS, the International Organization for Migration’s community liaison officer  program is delivering information and messages about the Government’s new policy to people in  Indonesia who may be considering a voyage to Australia.   

 Australian officials are also working with their counterparts in Pakistan and Afghanistan to provide  information to the community about the Australian Government’s policy. 

 

 

 

 Material used in ACBPS offshore communication activities is the same, or closely based upon, the  material developed by DIAC for use within Australia and among diaspora communities.
