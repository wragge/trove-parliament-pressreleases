 $75.4 million package provides major boost for Australia’s maritime security    

 Several major maritime security initiatives will ensure Australians continue to be well protected from  external threats, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said today.   

 Announcing a $75.4 million Customs maritime security funding package with the Prime Minister and  Deputy Prime Minister in Brisbane, Senator Ellison said the measures would put Australia ahead of the  rest of the world in two key areas - container inspection and port area surveillance.   

 The new funding will allow Customs to:   

 â¢ Increase by 25 per cent the number of imported containers subjected to x-ray examination ($48  million over four years);  â¢ Double the number of Australian ports covered by its national waterfront closed circuit TV  (CCTV) network ($17 million over four years); 

 â¢ Maintain first port boardings at up to 80 per cent ($9.3 million over three years), and  â¢ Identify information which could streamline the maritime security task for industry and deliver  enhanced security for the Australian community.   

 “Customs is Australia’s key frontline border protection agency, and this new funding will enable them  to provide an even higher level of protection for Australia against illicit drugs, illegal arrivals, disease  and other threats to the nation’s welfare,” Senator Ellison said.   

 “This package represents a significant boost to Customs border protection resources,” he said.   

 “The increase in operating hours at container examination facilities alone will allow Customs to boost  the number of containers x-rayed from 80,000 to 100,000 per year.   

 “Australia’s inspection rate of seven per cent of sea cargo imports means we are a world leader, putting  us right up with the US and ahead of other countries.   

 “The new funding will also enable Customs to board 80 per cent of shipping at first ports of arrival.   

 “Apart from the major metropolitan ports, the extra funds will allow for long-term posting of ten  additional Customs officers to Western Australia (five in Dampier, two in Geraldton and one each in  Fremantle, Port Hedland and Bunbury); eight extra officers in Queensland (two in Brisbane, two in  Gladstone, two in Mackay and one each in Weipa and Townsville) and one in the Northern Territory  (Nhulunbuy).”   

 Funding in the 2004/05 Budget allowed for 19 additional Customs staff to be employed Australia-wide.  The new funding will extend this commitment for a further three years.   

 The Customs national waterfront CCTV network, a key security and intelligence-gathering tool, will  also be expanded with the number of Australian ports covered by the system nearly doubled from 32 to  63. 

 

 “Customs CCTV system is acknowledged as a world leader in its field, and no other country has  achieved the coverage Australia has through the linking of all of its major international sea ports,”  Senator Ellison said.   

 Customs will also work to identify a common set of data that should be collected by border protection  agencies about people, goods and ships arriving into Australia, with the aim of a one-off submission of  trade information by industry to comply with all import, export and security requirements.    

 Such a process would enable Australian businesses to save time and money, and the whole of  government approach to risk management for the movement of cargo and people entering the country  would be improved.   

 “This solid commitment to border protection shows that the Howard Government will not rest in  ensuring that Australia’s borders are secure and protected against illegal activity and the threat of  terrorism,” Senator Ellison said.
