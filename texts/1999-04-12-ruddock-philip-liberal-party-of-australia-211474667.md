  OPEN LETTER TO ALL MEDIA OUTLETS

  REGARDING REFUGEES

  

  12 April 1999

  

  To Whom It May Concern

  

  The tragic events in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and recent 
arrivals of ve ssels harboring unlawful arrivals have generated 
considerable media attention and reporting.

  

 Throughout this reporting the descriptive ‘refugee’ 
has been widely applied -sometimes appropriately, and unfortunately, 
frequently not.

  

 The United Nations Convention relating to the status 
of refugees defines a refugee as someone who is:

  

  ·  outside their country of nationality 
or usual country of residence and

  

  ·  is unable or unwilling to return or to seek the protection 
of that country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons 
of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, 
or political opinion.

  

  To compare the plight of often traumatised and desperate people with 
those who may arrive on our shores clandestinely seeking m igration 
outcomes or work opportunities is entirely inappropriate.

  

 As an example, the occupants of the vessel that beached 
at Holloway’s Beach North of Cairns in March were not, despite the 
loose application of the term by many media outlets, refugees.

  

 Such people are more accurately described as unlawful 
arrivals, or as they are frequently euphemistically referred to, ‘boat-people’.

  

 Furthermore, people who apply to the Government of 
a country for recognition as a refugee are asylum seekers, pending determination 
of their claims.

  

 While this clarification may seem trivial, it is crucial 
that this term, with the very special and it conveys, is correctly applied. 
I would appreciate your assistance in this endeavour.

  

 Kind regards

  

 Philip Ruddock
