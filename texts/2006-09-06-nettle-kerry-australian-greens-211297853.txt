 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Refugee camp TAFEs wrong headed: asylum seekers living in  Australia should be given work rights. 

 

 Senator Nettle, 6 September 2006  

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today criticised the idea of establishing TAFE  like training for refugees waiting in overseas camps and instead moved an amendment  to the Migration Act to allow long-term bridging visa E (BVE) holders to work after  28 days, only to see it voted down by the government and opposition.  

 Currently many asylum seekers living in the community spend many months or years  unable to work and reliant on charity to survive.  

 "It's ludicrous for the Federal Government to suggest building TAFEs in African  refugee camps when there are asylum seekers already in Australia with skills who are  prevented from working," said Senator Nettle. 

 "Thousands of Bridging Visa E holders are currently living hand-to-mouth unable to  work or even get health care and are reliant on charity to survive, but the government  is unwilling to let them work. 

 "There were 7,927 BVE holders in 2005 and some asylum seekers have been on a  bridging visa E for many years. 

 "It makes sense that if a person is on a bridging visa E for longer than a month, then  they should be able to work and pay their way in Australian society. The Parliament  should have supported this amendment. 

 "The recent Senate Inquiry into the Migration Act recommended that Bridging Visa E  holders be given work rights.  

 "A report commissioned by the Uniting Church found that many bridging visa E  holders possess skills that are in demand in the Australian economy and that granting  them work rights would contribute approximately $188 million to the Australian 

 economy over three years. 

 "Bridging Visa E holders are forgotten people in the government's harsh attitude  toward asylum seekers."
