 Children Overboard Report to be released today

 The long awaited Report of the Senate Committee inquiry into the Children Overboard incident, which also investigated the Pacific Solution and the sinking of the SEIV X will be released this afternoon.

 Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Andrew Bartlett, who was on the Committee, said the report would contain a great deal of information about Government actions and implications of Government policy, that would not otherwise have become public.

 “The report will have important implications for Immigration, Border Protection, and Defence policy in Australia,” he said.

 “It is undeniable that, had different policies towards asylum seekers been adopted by the Government before the 2001 Federal election, an enormous amount of suffering and trauma would have been avoided,” Senator Bartlett concluded.

 To arrange interview with Senator Bartlett contact Daele Healy on (02) 6277 5724 or 0409 3000 47
