 BOATS REACH DOUBLE FIGURES SINCE TONY ABBOTT  SAID ‘NO’   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, today said boat arrivals had now hit double figures since Tony  Abbott rejected the Governmentâs offer to work together to implement offshore processing.    

 A boat carrying 26 asylum seekers was intercepted tonight - the 10th boat arrival since Tony  Abbott said ânoâ to a real solution to dealing with dangerous boat journeys.    

 “Mr Abbott needs to reflect on the fact that due to his relentless intransigence, boats have  now reached double figures since he said ânoâ,” Mr Bowen said.    

 “Itâs time for Mr Abbott to stop siding with the Greens and opposing offshore processing.  Australians are sick and tired of the politics and expect both sides of Parliament to work  together in the national interest to stop people risking their lives at sea.”   

 The Government has consistently warned that without a real deterrent for these dangerous  journeys to Australia, the boats would keep coming.   

 Since Tony Abbott said ânoâ to the Governmentâs legislation in September last year, the  number of boats has doubled.    

 Mr Clare said the boats would keep coming as long as Tony Abbott said no.    

 “If the Labor Party had opposed John Howard's terrorism laws after 9/11 we would have  been condemned, and rightly so,” Mr Clare said.   

 “The same applies here - this is in the national interest and lives are at risk.   

 “Tony Abbott should give the Government the power to stop these boat arrivals the way the  Labor Party gave John Howard the power to pass terrorism laws after 9/11.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
