 Children behind barbed wire: Almost 1000 minors in immigration detention in last year Almost one thousand minors were held in detention centres like Woomera over the last year, while 231 are still living behind barbed wire, it was revealed today in the Senate.

 While the majority of children were with their families, there are presently eight unaccompanied minors under mandatory detention. Six hundred and fifty one minors were released from the detention centres in the last year.

 The figures were provided by Senator Amanda Vanstone representing the Immigration Minister, in answer to a question from Senator Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

 “The Minister was unable to tell us the average length of time minors remained in detention but we know some children are born in detention and are walking by the time they are allowed out,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Too many of the 651 minors who were released from detention centres in the last year had been there for over a year,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Children and families who have not been convicted of any crime should not be subject to automatic, indefinite detention,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The allegations of child abuse at Woomera detention centre are just the latest in a line of complaints and concerns expressed about the impact of Australia's detention regime.”

 A coalition of 11 church and welfare organisations has called for an end to the detention of children in Australia.

 An inquiry into allegations of a rape of a 12 year old boy at Woomera detention centre began today.

 “There should be greater flexibility for families with children to be allowed into the community while they wait for their claims for refugee status to be examined,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
