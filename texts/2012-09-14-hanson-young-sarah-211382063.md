 Media Release 

 First plane lands in Nauru, but there is still no  ‘solution’   

 The first planeload of refugees touched down on Nauru this morning but there is still uncertainty  regarding how long they will be detained on the island and who will process their claims for asylum.   

 “We’ve seen a plane go to Nauru today and the question to the government is ‘when is the first  plane of refugees from Indonesia and Malaysia going to arrive on Australian soil?’” said Greens  immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young today.   

 “As the experts and the Greens know, the only way to save lives is by bringing refugees to Australia  safely from where they are in our region. Until there is a safer pathway and people in the camps in  Malaysia and Indonesia know they don’t have to board a boat, people will keep coming in  desperation.   

 “We need clarity from the Australian Government regarding just how long refugees will be made to  suffer in detention in Nauru.   

 “The government has refused to put a humane time limit on how long refugees will be held on  Nauru even though the ‘No Advantage’ rule has been discredited by the UNHCR.   

 “The Houston Report detailed a number of things that needed to be in place before anyone was sent  to Nauru and they’re simply not there. These include appropriate accommodation, clarity over who  will assess refugee claims, legal advice for asylum seekers and fair review of decisions for refugees.”
