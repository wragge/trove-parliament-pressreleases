 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs.

 THE HON S.J. WEST MP 

 43/83 4 June 1983

 DIEA TO IMPROVE STATUS OF MIGRANT WOMEN '

 A "Women's Desk" is being created in the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA),  the Minister, Mr Stewart West,  said in Brisbane today.

 Mr West, during visit to Brisbane,  took part in a panel  discussion at a "Migrant Women Speak-Out",  held at the  West End State School.

 Mr West reaffirmed the Government's commitment to improve  the status of women in Australian society.  Migrant women  face special difficulties in areas such as -  health care,   occupational safety,  psychiatric care,  discrimination 

 in employment, sexual harrassment,  and learning English  as a second language.

 To make his own Department more responsive to women's  issues, a "Women's Desk" is being established in the  DIEA. A first step will be the appointment of a Migrant  Women's Co-ordinator. -

 "The Co-ordinator, in close consultation with migrant and  refugee women's groups,  will investigate all matters of  concern to migrant and refugee women and provide advice  to myself and to senior management in my Department", Mr West said. .  .
