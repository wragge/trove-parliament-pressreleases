 POLISH BOAT PEOPLE - A SIGN OF THE TIMES?

 The implications of the arrival of a group of Polish boat-people on  Australia's Northern Queensland coast are significant. We are now witness  to a new and remarkable passage of asylum seekers from Europe.

 Twelve Polish nationals had flown from Poland to Indonesia and then on to  Papua New Guinea where they then set sail for Australia in a small boat.

 With millions of people on the move in Europe, seeking asylum from  economic difficulties and political upheaval, the significance of this latest  arrival should not be lost on the Government.

 The Coalition has expressed its fear that the Government's inability to  control our borders would send a signal to our region that Australia is an  easy target for illegal entry. Of the 400 or so "boat people" who have arrived  in Australia since 1989 claiming asylum, the Government has not been able  to effect the removal of a single one. Only volunteers or non-asylum seekers  have left.

 It is now obvious, with the arrival of the Polish nationals, that the signal is  being heard internationally. The potential for an enormous number of  asylum seekers from around the world to begin arriving in Australia is now  a reality.

 Without wanting to prejudge the claims of the newest arrivals, in the context  of the political changes that have occurred in Poland, it is hard to imagine  what claims they could make, under the international covenants, for refugee  status and protection.

 - a requirement for leave before further appeal of contested  applications is permitted;

 - exclusion of appeals beyond the administrative procedures,  except on questions of law to the High Court, also by leave;

 - re-deployment of sufficient staff and resources to refugee  determination to bring the process under control.

 It is essential that these proposals are adopted to address the current crisis  and remove the possibility of it occurring in the future.

 The Coalition has always asserted that those who have bona-fide claims,  determined against existing internationally accepted criteria, must be given  protection. Applicants who have been ascertained to have unfounded claims  for protection, must be removed.

 The Government is now under enormous pressure to begin repatriating  those people whose claims for refugee status have been rejected.
