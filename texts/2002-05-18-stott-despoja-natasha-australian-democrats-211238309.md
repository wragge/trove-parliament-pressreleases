 AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRAT SPEECHES

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja Portfolio: Miscellaneous

 Dated: 18 May 2002 Location: Canberra

 Senator Stott Despoja speech: Australian Democrats National Conference

 Thank you Roslyn .

 I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Ngunnawal people.

 I acknowledge my Senate colleagues and State and Territory representatives.

 Welcome everyone to the 2002 Australian Democrats’ National Conference. This is my first conference as Leader and I am very proud to lead the Party in our silver anniversary year celebrating a quarter of a century of the Democrats as the third force in Australian politics.

 I extend a special welcome to our guests, including our guest speakers and the participants in the corporate partnership program.

 This year marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of our Party and the 21st anniversary of first holding the balance of power.

 In 1977, Star Wars premiered; Australia’s population had passed 14 million. Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and had decided to go ahead with uranium mining, and Gough Whitlam was Opposition Leader (for the last time).

 Unemployment was considered unreasonably high at 5.4%; the Australian people voted to replace “God Save the Queen” with “Advance Australia Fair” as the national anthem, and a new political Party was formed and entered the Australian Parliament.

 This political Party was different in its policies and the way it practiced politics. Participatory democracy had appeared on the political landscape.

 The first party ballot was for the name and the already 7,000 strong membership wisely chose "Australian Democrats" over 56 possible alternatives such as ‘Beacon on the Hill party’, ‘Civic Sanity Party’, and the ‘Life Be In It Movement’.

 The first Democrat policy passed opposed uranium mining - an issue that is as relevant today.

 In 1981, the Democrats first held the Balance of Power.

 Since 1984, there has never been fewer than seven Democrats members in the Senate, ensuring Party status.

 We have been the most successful third Party ever, (in this two Party system).

 It has been more than a year since the Democrats last conference , and what an extraordinary time it has been.

 The tragic events of September 11, Australian military personnel involved in a new international conflict, being used to board boats to turn asylum seekers away and the Government building processing camps in Pacific nations.

 A year ago, the re-election of the Howard Government seemed unlikely. Now post-election we have seen a stream of Coalition scandals shunted across the public stage.

 And now another Budget that attacks poorer Australians.

 For the Democrats, the last year has been hard work.

 With election campaigns in Western Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory, the ACT, South Australia and a number of by-elections and of course the Federal poll.

 There have been wins and losses. Unfortunately, Vicki Bourne narrowly missed out on holding her seat in NSW despite outpolling the Greens and One Nation in both Houses of Federal Parliament.

 The rise in the House of Representatives vote was a good result for the candidates and campaigners who worked so hard across the country.

 I want to thank all our candidates, campaigners, and many active members for their work.

 The good news is that the Party has increased its membership base and we continue to hold the effective balance of power in the Senate. And it has never been more important for the Democrats to be in the Parliament. In the last 25 years I do not believe there has ever been a less honest, less tolerant and less compassionate Government.

 In the next year our focus will not be on election campaigns, with the important exception of the NSW poll in March - but on how we build and share our vision for Australia.

 The Party has some breathing space to focus on branch building, local campaigns, policy development and continuing to increase membership numbers.

 Strategic review Since becoming Leader, I have been eager to instigate a National Strategic Review to reflect on the strengths and limitations of our political heritage and processes, and to plan for the future.

 We must approach the review with the values, which have always characterised our Party — tolerance, respect for different opinions and robust debate of issues. And we must also act as a united and positive team.

 I stress that this review is not of our policies - (unlike the ALP review). Our policies are decided democratically by the members and that is not going to change.

 The political principles on which the Party was founded, are still relevant today but we face new as well as old challenges, as to how we share that vision with more Australians.

 We are seeing the widespread disengagement of the Australian People from politics. Cynicism is so high, each new scandal and revelation of deceit, makes less impact. With the lowering of the public’s expectations, comes the lowering of political standards.

 In this environment, promoting a progressive agenda is harder than ever before, but more important.

 We will need courage to face our opponents, some of whom willingly lie, deceive and vilify - they lie about refugees, about welfare recipients, about homosexuality, about nuclear dangers, even about the role of the senate. They lie about their policies and they lie about us.

 We will continue to tell the truth.

 We need members to be informed, participating in the public debate and holding the Democrat banner high. Talking to your friends and colleagues, writing letters to the papers and ringing talkback.

 Last week - after the Budget, a Democrat in Rockhampton got onto the local radio station and gave them 15 minutes on our support for disability pensioners. Wonderful - but it gets better…. The station was so impressed by his knowledge of the issues, they gave him a weekly spot for Democrat comment. - Next week it is on our Maternity Leave proposal.

 We may not always have the numbers, but Democrats are always the most informed.

 In this our 25th year we pay tribute to our founding fathers and our founding mothers - and to the many people who have given their time and efforts over the years for this Party. Today, I want to acknowledge

 Sam Hudson who was National Secretary of the Party for 18 years, as well as holding staff positions including Chief of Staff. She has resigned from both, to work for the Brewers, and to be an ordinary member - an extra-ordinary member.

 Sam will be speaking tonight at the dinner where the Democrats will pay tribute to her. Her work will also be acknowledged I’m sure at the “25 years of the politics of women” speech tomorrow.

 The 25th anniversary is an opportunity to highlight the leading role the Democrats have played on many issues including protection of the environment, human rights, education and accountability in Government.

 One of the ways we are doing that, is through a speakers series around Australia.

 The first speech was in Melbourne on “25 years of nuclear-free politics” given by Peter Garrett, President of the ACF.

 The second address was on refugees in Perth in recognition of our “off Broadway opening” on the actual anniversary of the first public meeting 25 years ago.

 Tomorrow, Dr Marian Sawer will speak on “25 years of the Politics of women” - and bring your friends - that event is open to the public.

 In 1977, thousands of people turned up to town halls around Australia wanting to be part of a new political party and searching for what Don Chipp called “the politics of hope”.

 I believe that Democrat voters are inspirational voters. People inspired to create a better society. Inspired to protect their children and grandchildren’s future. Inspired by much more than their own back pocket and the politics of division and hate.

 It has never been more important for the Democrats to be in the Parliament. I want to outline some of our Parliamentary Achievements from the last year:

 The Democrats have consistently called this arrogant (and sometimes secretive and deceitful) Government to account - from former Minister Reith’s imaginary children overboard, to Senator Heffernan’s fantasies, to abuse of Parlaimentary entitlements. We will continue to seek much stronger accountability measures for parliament, and the government. We have a Bill for a two-year ‘cooling off’ period for retiring Ministers. We have extricated important information from them, such as plans for the Lucas Heights nuclear facility or drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. We have led the anti-nuclear agenda whether it is opposing a nuclear waste dump in SA and a nuclear facility at Lucas heights, focusing attention on accidents at uranium mines and the legacy of nuclear tests. We were able to get significant changes made to the Personal Services Income Alienation Form - the “Son of BAS”.

 In a time of corporate collapses, the Democrats have argued the need for safeguards, regulation and sometimes intervention, rather than just privatisation, competition policy and “Market rules”. We introduced the Corporate Code of Conduct and achieved substantial improvements to R&D law in 2001. We strengthened the capacity of ANZFA - the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Board to protect public health and safety. The Democrats played a vital role on the Senate inquiry into a certain maritime incident. Indeed we were the first to challenge the Government’s assertion, without evidence, that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard. We were responsible for the inquiry into child migration to Australia, and the $115 million Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. We initiated a Senate Inquiry into Higher Education which led to the report, Universities In Crisis. Parents of cystic fibrosis children are now eligible for the carers’ payments, thanks to Democrat lobbying. We prevented changes to diminish the rights of appeal against social security decisions and to make sole parents financially worse off

 And, this week, I introduced into the Parliament historic legislation for a national system of paid maternity leave- a government funded Payment for 14 weeks at the basic wage, with the potential for negotiated

 contributions by employers and employees to top it up.

 We can fund this proposal, at a cost of about $352 million, well within the cost of the third year of the Baby Bonus. There are many more initiatives that we have proposed but are so far being held back by the old parties - but we will keep working on them: We took to the last election a pledge - it was a core pledge - it didn’t disappear after the election and I restate here our commitment to oppose: - any increase in the rate of the GST - tax cuts for the rich until the Government addresses the needs of the one million Australians living in poverty - any undermining of industrial relations protection - and any further privatisation of Telstra or Australia Post The Democrats support: § greater environmental protection § a Charter of Rights and Australia meeting our international human rights obligations § an independent and properly funded national broadcaster - - And reconciliation, an apology to the stolen generation, and a treaty between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians

 Just a snapshot of some other ongoing issues includes: â Our proposal for national approach to child abuse prevention. â changing the schools funding formula to direct more resources to our under funded public schools; â stopping wholesale land-clearing in Queensland;

 â defending the right of women to access IVF regardless of marital status. â We are have been working toward a solution on public liability insurance and reform of food pricing to deliver a fair go for farm gate prices â We have been pushing to get young people with a disability, out of aged care nursing homes.

 â salinity and water usage - we have long worked on the Murray Darling Basin issue. â reducing greenhouse emissions and battling climate change â we have re- introduced our Anti Genocide Bill and recently the Sexuality Anti-Discrimination Bill And the Democrats will continue to fight for the humane treatment of asylum seekers.

 That’s some of our agenda, so what is the Government’s agenda?

 Some important upcoming Federal bills include - the anti-terrorism legislation, - industrial relations - again, - and probably later in the year - if the Government can get it through their own back benchers- changes to the media ownership laws.

 The Democrats closely scrutinised the anti-terrorism laws proposed by the Government. We recognise that security is an essential requirement for defending democracy, however, in the process of defending democracy, we must not compromise those very freedoms we are seeking to defend.

 This week in the Senate the Coalition & the ALP were debating whether the film “Baise Moi”, should be shown, and further, whether the English translation of "baise" could be used during the parliamentary debate. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns.

 The real f-word right now is freedom. And that’s the word at risk right now.

 If these extraordinary powers are implemented, there are no assurances as to how future governments will exercise them, or against whom. You do not have the right to remain silent.

 The Democrats have said we will not support this legislation. The Government has presented an ambit claim for arbitrary executive power to the Parliament. The Parliament should not entertain such a claim.

 The Government's determination to pass such draconian legislation illustrates more clearly than ever the need for protection in law of fundamental rights and freedoms.

 I am announcing today that the Democrats will move an amendment to the bills to include our statutory Bill of Rights within the anti-terrorism legislation. Entrenchment in law of a comprehensive set of rights is

 long overdue.

 Senate reform No doubt the Coalition Government would prefer that the Parliament rubber-stamped every one of their proposals without scrutiny or consideration. The last 25 years would have been very different, if they had been able to.

 This debate about Senate reform is not just about unfair dismissals, selling Telstra, deals for media mates, anti-freedom legislation and whatever else the Coalition have up their sleeves.

 It is also about the appalling Budget just announced - about cuts to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Disability Support Pensions.

 Now that their Budget is in doubt, the attacks on the Senate will escalate. Let us be clear - this is not about blocking Supply. Generations of Democrat senators have undertaken not to do so.

 This is not about blocking the Budget, but making it better.

 They say they don’t have the money because of the War on Terrorism - it is just not true.

 What the Treasurer is covering up is that this Government is again taking from the poor, to fund welfare for the well off.

 PBS By increasing the price of co-payments, they are aiming to discourage people from filling their prescriptions: this is how the Government expects to make its savings to the PBS:

 But who is going to stop getting their prescriptions filled because of a $1 increase in the concessional rate? Poorer Australians. Who is going to stop filling prescriptions because of a $6.20 rise in the non-concessional rate? Poorer families.

 The Treasurer is saying take your medicine now or it will be worse later. But some people won't be able to afford their medicine now.

 In regard, to the proposed changes to the Disability Support Pension, the Democrats successfully campaigned against mutual obligation being imposed on these pensioners as part of welfare reform in 2001. This Budget they have tried the same trick in a different guise and they are going to have to pull back again. They have already done a half back flip with one group on the disability support pension. Minister Vanstone said the gate is still open. The Prime Minister implied the gate is closed. Whether the gate is open or closed there is a lot of bull getting out. It’s the uncertainty and the vilifying that this announcement brings, which has hurt people even before any changes are made. This has been made clear by the hundreds of phone calls from distressed and desperate disability pensioners who have contacted my office.

 The Treasurer has tried to paint some them as people who have back problems and can do other kinds of work and therefore will be taken off the pension

 The fact is the pension is only paid if they have a severe spinal impairment.

 Why pick on people with a disability when there are already more people wanting jobs than there are jobs available? There are 8 people for every job vacancy yet there is nothing in this budget to create jobs or to give the unemployed hope. Long term unemployment has hardly budged since this Government came to power. After 10 years of economic growth, we still cannot find jobs.

 The Democrats will oppose the Government’s proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Disability Support Pension and we welcome the fact that the Labor Party has - after some prevarication - followed our lead.

 The Democrats have offered the Government a way of resolving the Senate stand off that is better, fairer policy.

 I have written to the Prime Minister urging him to find savings by means testing the 30% Private Health Insurance rebate. The additional monies raised will more than pay for the increase of the PBS co-payment and the cuts to the disabilities pension scheme.

 Maybe the Prime Minister Howard does not like this proposal because Peter Costello previously suggested it!

 In Treasurer Costello’s speech for the 1996 Budget, he said, “From 1 July 1997 we will be providing income-tested rebates for the cost of private health insurance”.(p.3)

 Now we still have a rebate, but not the “income-tested”.

 In the 1996 Budget, Peter Costello made it clear he was "sharing the pain" and: - Introduced the Super High Income Earners Surcharge; - Launched an attack on high value trusts of high income earners; and - Introduced a capped and income-tested private health insurance rebate

 This Budget: - he has cut the surcharge; - failed to follow through on taxing trusts; and - failed to cap or income test the rebate.

 The Prime Minister has said that income-testing the Rebate is not acceptable because the top tax bracket is not a high income. And, certainly $60000 for a family it is not, but we make allowances for dependents through, we can explore different levels for the cut off.

 My message to the PM is “we are ready to talk about these issues”.

 This is the highest-taxing, highest-spending government in our history but they have to cut back on pharmaceutical benefits and income support for the disabled.

 Economic boom times and they say they cannot afford to take care of the sick and poor.

 If this Budget cannot bring a more secure future for the most vulnerable Australians, then this Budget in its current form does not have a secure future.

 The Treasurer’s priorities are in stark contrast to the Australian Democrat’s view of what we should be doing with this once-in-a-generation boom.

 We have a responsibility to tackle the big issues confronting Australia over the next 25 years: healing our social fabric, battling the environmental crisis and investing in education.

 I predict that many of the Democrats’ achievements over the next quarter of a century will be similar to those of the last 25 years. We will demand honest and accountable Government; practical protection of our environment, and respect for human rights.

 Our policies will continue to be discussed, debated and democratically decided by our members.

 We should be proud and loud about the Democrats history and work together to keep making history.
