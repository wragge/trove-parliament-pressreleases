 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. The Hon.  Ian Macphee, MP

 POLISH REFUGEES

 "The developing situation in Poland and the possibility of a future  exodus of refugees from Poland is being carefully monitored by  the Australian Government", the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee said today.

 The Minister was speaking after a meeting he had organised with  representatives of the Polish community in Melbourne.  A similar  meeting is being organised in Sydney for tomorrow.

 "The Government is in contact with other Western Governments '   and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with a view  to ensuring that any future response to the Polish refugee  situation by the international community is a carefully co­ ordinated one. In this regard, Australia stands ready to play 

 its part," Mr Macphee said.

 "When the situation first became difficult 18 months, ago the-'  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs developed contingency  plans to select and proces.sv.much larger numbers of Poles who  might not wish to return to their country," the Minister said.

 "These plans wo.uld allow for the selection of a significant  increase in the number of Poles from different parts of  Europe at very short notice. The plans include the staffing  and financial implications of setting up selection arrangements, 

 transportation to Australia and provision of post-arrival  services on arrival here",  Mr Macphee said.

 The Minister said that while developing these plans the Government  had been, concerned to avoid any action that might further  exacerbate the situation of the Polish people in their  present crisis. That remains our objective.

 "Reports available to the Government indicate that Poland is still  isolated and that it is virtually impossible for anybody to leave  Poland at the moment," Mr Macphee said.

 Referring to arrangements to assist Poles already outside  Poland the Minister said the Government was increasing the  number of Polish refugees admitted to Australia by 1,000 under the  current Eastern European Refugee Program.

 "This decision, which was taken just before the present crisis  arose, as a result of discussions which I had With the  Austrian Minister for Interior, will assist in reducing the  number of Polish asylum seekers in Austrian camps and is in 

 line with recently announced decisions by the United States  and Canada to increase their programs," Mr Macphee added.

 The decision will mean that the total intake of people under  the Government's refugee and special humanitarian programs  this financial year will rise from 22,500 to 23,500.

 The Minister also said that Polish nationals currently in Australia on visitor or tourist visas who do not wish to return to Poland will be granted a visa extension or, if appropriate,  change of status. These arrangements are  meant to enable those who wish to remain in Australia to do

 so or those who wish to remain temporarily in Australia to have time to assess their situation.  .

 "Australian residents of Polish origin with relatives in Poland  or in other countries may be confident that migration sponsor­ ships lodged in respect of these people will be considered .  ^..... quickly. -  They should be aware, however, that it is not certain  when, or in what circumstances, contact with the Polish Govern­ ment on migration matters will be resumed", he said. .

 "The Polish community should be reassured that the Government  is ready to act quickly should the need for a special response  emerge and that events in Poland and Australia's reaction to  those events, are being carefully assessed on a day-to-day  basis." .
