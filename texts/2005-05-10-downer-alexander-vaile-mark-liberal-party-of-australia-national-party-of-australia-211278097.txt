 Joint Media Release

 The Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander  Downer and the Minister for Trade Mark Vaile

 10 May 2005

 Budget 2005-06 

 In the 2005-06 Budget, the Australian Government has  announced a number of measures to advance the  interests of Australia and Australians internationally. 

 New security measures for Australian missions 

 The Government will provide a further $149.5 million  over four years to enhance security at Australia's  overseas missions. This will bring the total amount  allocated for overseas security to almost $1 billion  since 2002 and demonstrates the high priority we place  on ensuring the safety of our overseas staff and of the  thousands of Australian and foreign visitors to our  missions. 

 The funding will ensure that our embassies and  consulates can operate effectively in this changing  international security environment and that new  minimum security standards are met. Work at a large 

 number of our overseas missions will include the  redesign of some and the relocation of others where  security cannot be improved in their present locations.  Emergency communications will also be upgraded.

 Development of biometric technology for border  control 

 The Government will commit $185.7 million over four  years for the development of biometric technology for  border control. This initiative will contribute to  national security, reduce the cost to the Australian  community of identity fraud and ensure that passenger  numbers can be managed effectively.

 As part of the initiative, the Government will provide  funding of $67.5 million over four years to the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the  introduction of the new biometric passport - or  ePassport - in the last quarter of this year. All eligible  Australians seeking new or replacement passports from  that time will receive the new ePassport containing a  microchip which stores an electronic image of the  passport holder. This image will be matched against a  photograph of the passport holder taken at customs  checkpoints. The cost of this will be offset by a $19  increase in the fee for an adult passport and an  increase of $9.50 in the child/senior passport. 

 The ePassport will provide Australians with a highly  secure and reliable identity document and ensure that  we remain at the leading edge of international passport 

 technology and fraud detection techniques. The  ePassport complies with International Civil Aviation  Organization standards for electronic travel documents  and will ensure Australia's continued participation in  the US Visa Waiver Programme.

 Australia to host APEC 2007 

 The Government will provide $216.3 million over three  years to enable Australia to host the Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 2007. Fifteen  Australian Government agencies will collaborate on  policy, organisational logistics and security planning for  this major international event, culminating in the  meeting of APEC Leaders in Sydney scheduled for  September 2007. 

 As part of the initiative, the Government will provide  $14 million over three years to the Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade to develop and manage  Australia's APEC 2007 policy agenda and provide host-year support for a number of APEC organisations and  meetings. 

 In the 16 years since its inaugural meeting in Canberra  in 1989, APEC has become a key regional forum for the  facilitation of economic growth, trade and investment  in our region and an important contributor to regional  security. The APEC Leaders' meeting and associated  events in Sydney will be the most significant  international meeting ever hosted by Australia,  involving the leaders of APEC's 21 member economies 

 and thousands of government and business  representatives.

 Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands 

 The Government will provide funding of $840.6 million  over four years to enable the the Australian-led  Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)  to continue its work. This demonstrates the  Government's long-term commitment to consolidation  of the significant progress made to date. The funding  will ensure our continuing assistance to the Solomon  Islands Government in the restoration of law and order  and the consolidation of broad-ranging reforms. This  benefits Australia's own security and the security of  other Pacific countries. 

 The package strengthens RAMSI's transition from  stabilisation and law enforcement work to wider state  building and development activities. It will support the  transition to self-reliance by the Royal Solomon Islands  Police, enhance the justice and prison system and  involve economic governance and machinery of  government reforms. 

 Funding of $15.1 million over four years will be  provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Trade to continue its coordination role in Honiara as  lead agency for this whole-of-government effort.  Agencies involved include AusAID, the Australian  Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and  other public service personnel from the Departments of 

 Treasury and Finance.

 Regional counter-terrorism package 

 The Australian Government will outlay an additional  $40.3 million over the next four years to boost regional  cooperation in the fight against terrorism.

 New measures will build on successful regional  cooperation in law enforcement, border and transport  security, intelligence and legal affairs. 

 Key elements of this package will aim to counter  terrorist links and movements between the countries of  maritime South East Asia. This reflects the high priority  placed by the Government on engagement with  neighbouring countries to make our region more secure.

 National security - countering the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction 

 The Australian Government will spend $43.3 million  over four years to boost the collection, coordination  and analysis of intelligence on the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.

 The Government recognises the threat posed by the  proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological  weapons and we are committed to strengthening our  protective measures including through the enhanced  gathering of information on proliferation activities. 

 This initiative will strengthen specialist and technical 

 advice capabilities concerning weapons of mass  destruction and will improve coordination. This will  assist Australia's whole-of-government efforts to  counter proliferation, including by enhancing controls  on the export of dual-use goods, technology and  knowledge.

 Export facilitators for Australia-US Free Trade  Agreement 

 The Government will provide $6 million over two years  for 30 new Austrade export facilitators to help  Australian businesses take advantage of export  opportunities arising from the Australia-United States  Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA). 

 This measure significantly boosts the number of  Austrade export facilitators available to perform  valuable business development work in the United  States, including in specific industries. A total of 23  export advisers will be appointed to work in the United  States. Ten of these will work on general market  opportunities, five on government procurement  opportunities, three on agricultural export  opportunities and five on niche market opportunities.  An additional seven mobile export advisers will be  based in locations around Australia.

 Iraq reconstruction assistance 

 The Government will provide an additional $45 million  over two years for further reconstruction assistance in 

 Iraq. This will bring Australia's total reconstruction  commitment to Iraq to more than $170 million since  2003. We will continue to focus on those niche areas  where Iraq has particular expertise including  governance, agriculture and related economic and  trade reforms.

 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative 

 The Government will provide $34.8 million over three  years for Australia's continuing share of multilateral  debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries  (HIPC) Debt Initiative. 

 The HIPC Initiative provides debt relief to the world's  poorest and most heavily indebted countries, which are  pursuing sound adjustment and reform programmes  supported by the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank. The HIPC debt relief package is in addition  to other bilateral aid.

 Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development 

 The Government will spend $24.5 million over four  years to expand the Australian Youth Ambassadors for  Development (AYAD) programme. This will increase the  total funding for the programme to $52.5 million over  four years. The number of young Australian  ambassadors working in developing countries in the Asia  Pacific region will increase from 230 to about 400. 

 Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction 

 and Development - Secretariat 

 The Government will provide $8.6 million over two  years to support the day-to-day operations of the  Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and  Development. The funding will cover AusAID's  programme management costs, the operations of a  small inter-departmental Secretariat, located in the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the  placement of staff in Indonesia to work with relevant  Indonesian government agencies. 

 Aid Highlights 

 The Government will provide $2.491 billion Official  Development Assistance (ODA) - an increase of $358  million over the 2004-05 Budget figure of $2.133 billion  and a real increase of 11.7 per cent. This represents  the fifth consecutive real increase in Australia's ODA.  Australia is one of only five donor countries to record  consecutive real increases in ODA from 2001 to 2004.  The ratio of Australia's ODA to Gross National Income  (GNI) for 2005-06 is estimated at 0.28 per cent - above  the international donor average of 0.25 per cent in  2004. 

 The Australian aid programme advances our national  interest by helping developing countries reduce poverty  and achieve sustainable development. Our partnership  with Indonesia will be significantly strengthened.  Funding for ongoing programmes will be expanded to an  estimated $302 million and a further $1 billion will be 

 allocated to the Australia-Indonesia Partnership  Programme. Funding for Papua New Guinea and the  Pacific will grow to $955 million - including increases  for PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji. A new  contribution of $3 million over three years will fund  regional anti-corruption initiatives. Funding for the  battle against HIV/AIDS and other transboundary  threats will also be increased with the Australian  Government allocating a further $50 million over three  years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  Malaria and $5 million to a new regional programme to  combat Avian Influenza.

 Funding for humanitarian, emergency and refugee  programmes will rise to $170 million. To help with post-tsunami reconstruction, the ODA for Sri Lanka will rise  to $29 million. The Government will also work with  regional countries such as the Philippines, Iraq and  Afghanistan to address security issues, mitigate the  impacts of conflict and assist in post-conflict recovery.
