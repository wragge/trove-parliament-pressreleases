  BOAT PEOPLE PROCESSING CENTRE TO BE ACTIVATED AT CURTIN 

  A new reception and processing centre for unauthorised boat arrivals will be activated at RAAF  Base Curtin near Derby in Western Australia, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Senator Nick Bolkus said today. 

  Senator Bolkus said that in January agreement was reached between the Department ofImmigration  and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Defence to use the facilities at RAAF Base Curtin if  required, until the end of March 1996. 

  The decision to activate the base follows the two boat arrivals recently in Darwin and the arrival  of a boat on Christmas Island in January. The arrival of the boats carrying 171 people, has made  the new processing centre a cost-effective response to boat people accommodation. 

  The boat people from Darwin and Christmas Island will move into the centre as soon as the  facilities are ready. 

  The centre which can accommodate 300 people, will be activated over the next few weeks. In  comparison with other sites examined, RAAF Base Curtin requires minimal changes including the  establishment of an administration centre, lighting and the replacement of the existing fencing. 

  The Minister said a large number of factors has been considered in the selection process, including  the availability of suitable facilities, time to activate, cost-effectiveness and consultation with the  community. 

  Senator Bolkus said the cost of commissioning the centre will be approximately half a million  dollars and monthly running costs will also be around half a million dollars. 

  The Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre which houses 756 people, is at its  effective capacity and there are no immediate plans to house new boat arrivals at that Centre. 

  The Department has investigated a wide range of potential short-term and long-term facilities for  boat people. It is continuing to examine a number of possible sites for longer term accommodation,  should it be required.
