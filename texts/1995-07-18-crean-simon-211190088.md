  MEDIA RELEASE 

  Simon Crean, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs 

  18Julvl995 

  AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY AID FOR FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 

  Australia will give an emergency $500.000 cash grant to assist international relief efforts  for refugees and displaced persons in the former Yugoslavia, including those from  Srebrenica and other designated safe areas, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Simon Crean, announced today.'' â‘ â‘ 

  The money will be dispatched immediately to the International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC) Emergency Appeal from AusAID, the Australian Agency for International  Development. 

  "The Government is deeply concerned at the plight of tens of thousands of civilians  displaced by the collapse of the safe havens in the face of the Bosnian Serb Army's  offensive ," Mr Crean said. 

  "The ICRC's first concern is to meet the immediate needs of these people by providing  safe drinking water, food and shelter. 

  "The neutrality and independence of the ICRC enables it to operate in areas often  inaccessible to other relief agencies. It is taking every possible step to convince the  Bosnian Serb authorities to allow unimpeded passage for humanitarian convoys. 

  "In the current crisis, Australia can make an effective contribution to assisting those in  need by providing the funds to the ICRC ." 

  Mr Crean reiterated Australia 's view that it was time for the parties to the conflict to  return to the negotiating table, committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the tragic  conflict in which innocent civilians continue to suffer most. 

  Today's $500,000 grant is drawn from AusAID's refugee and relief program. It brings the  total of Australian Government humanitarian aid to the former Yugoslavia since the start  of the crisis in September 1991 to $4.85 million.
