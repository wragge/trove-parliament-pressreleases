 Another Labor leader, another policy  failure   25/06/10  

 Prime Minister Julia Gillard has failed to commit to any changes in Labor's failed  border protection policies that have attracted 140 illegal boat arrivals carrying more  than 6,500 people, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison  said today. 

 “Yesterday and today the Prime Minister has refused to admit that Labor's failed  border protection policies was one of the areas where the Government had lost its  way. Tomorrow will be the same, no change to policy,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Prime Minister Gillard will find out, just like the Prime Minister she brutally  terminated, that you can't spin the boats away. It requires real policies that deliver real  action,” he said. 

 “To stop the unprecedented arrival of illegal boats to Australia requires a change of  policy by Labor, not a change of Leader. Julia Gillard represents the same failed  border protection policies as Kevin Rudd that have seen illegal boat arrivals go from  three per year to three per week. 

 “The only way to change Labor's failed border protection policies to the Coalition's  proven policies that stopped the boats is to change the Government. 

 “Julia Gillard's first challenge will be to address the discriminatory and ineffective  asylum assessment freeze that expires for Sri Lankans on July 9. 

 “Since this policy was introduced eleven weeks ago there have been 34 illegal boat  arrivals carrying more than 1,500 people. 

 “The Prime Minister must indicate whether she will acknowledge that Labor has lost  its way on border protection and adopt the Coalition's full suite of proven border  protection policies. 

 “People smugglers respond to what you do, not what you say. Labor's problem on  border protection is their policy, not their message, nor their messenger,” he said.
