 Kosovars to Return Home This Week  

 MPS 033/2000 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced that 259 Kosovars in Australia on temporary Safe Haven visas, will be expected to return to their homeland on a charter flight on 8 April.

 Mr Ruddock said the announcement follows advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that it is safe and appropriate for the evacuees to return.

 "When the Kosovar evacuees came here last May they agreed to a temporary stay in Australia until conditions had improved in Kosovo," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Despite some media reports to the contrary, the UNHCR considers it is time for those remaining Kosovo Albanians who no longer require international protection to return home. Hundreds of thousands have already done that.

 "I have considered each case individually, taking into account the claims made by each family and, where appropriate, advice from the Department of Health and Aged Care and health professionals working with the individual Kosovars.

 "I would expect all Kosovars who have no legal right to remain in Australia to leave on the return flight on 8 April. I would counsel those considering other options to be aware that from midnight of 8 April they will be in Australia unlawfully and officers from my department will have no option but to take them into Immigration detention for removal from Australia as soon as practicable."

 Mr Ruddock said 130 will have their temporary safe haven visas extended, mainly for medical reasons.

 "I have decided that another 110 will be allowed to apply for protection visas and 2 Kosovars who will be permitted to apply for partner visas on the basis of a relationship with an Australian.

 "Those remaining in Australia will move into the community to areas where they will be able to access appropriate health, medical and welfare services until it is time for them to return home."

 The Minister said the departure was a continuation of the repatriation process which began last year and saw 3,462 evacuees return to Kosovo.

 The remaining two safe havens established to accommodate the 3,924 Kosovars who came to Australia - Bandiana in Victoria and East Hills in NSW - will be closed to Kosovars following the departures.
