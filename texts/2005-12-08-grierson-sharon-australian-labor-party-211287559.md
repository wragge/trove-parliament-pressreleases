 Media Release  8 December 2005   

 MIGRANTS TO NEWCASTLE LET DOWN BY GOVERNMENT    

 The Federal Minister for Multicultural Affairs and the Department of Immigration & Multicultural  Affairs (DIMIA) must guarantee that they will fix the appalling administration of the Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) in Newcastle and the Hunter, following the awarding  of the new contract to a Sydney-based consortium on 1 October. That this is a “transition”  period is no excuse for letting down the most vulnerable of new arrivals to our community. 

 

 Following my representations to the Minister since September, a Departmental officer visited  Newcastle late in November to investigate the many reports of problems and neglect. As a  result, some changes have been made by the IHSS provider, Australian Centre for Languages  (ACL). But even these changes give a lesser service than previously existed and in my view still  fall short of what is needed to bring about successful settlement outcomes and support  meaningful integration into our community and our ways.   

 In November I outlined to Parliament some dreadful examples of inadequate support from ACL  to African families arriving in Newcastle.   

 You cannot expect people arriving in our community to sleep on the floor or a family of eight to  survive on a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs, a tub of butter and a $50 food voucher for ten days.  This is not a Newcastle welcome to our new humanitarian refugees fleeing trauma and  suffering.   

 The migrant services provided in Newcastle have always been of an extremely high standard,  and it is disappointing that this reputation and harmony is being undermined by the new  Sydney-based arrangements for the delivery of IHSS services that has diminished local  participation.   

 After meeting with several of these families, social and health workers, service providers, and  leaders of the African Australian communities, I am concerned that the new contract  arrangements aren’t working in the best interests of these migrants - who have already faced  great trauma before coming to our country.   

 DIMIA’s initial intervention that found breaches in service delivery and gained an increase in  staff must continue, with a guarantee that the IHSS contract will be delivered properly in our  community or be revoked.
