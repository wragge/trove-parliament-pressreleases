 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Polls, Refugees, John Howard's Failure At APEC, Coast Guard

 Transcript - Brisbane, Queensland - 23 October 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the polls this morning, is it a boost for your campaign so far?

 BEAZLEY: As I said, in this campaign I'm a fighter, not an analyst - but we've been talking about jobs, health, education, family living standards. That's on the hearts of the average Australian. We've also been committing - I'm here committing myself to serve a full term as Prime Minister and to subject myself to a test at the election after that. Tomorrow we'll be halfway through the election campaign - and John Howard still has not said that he will serve.

 JOURNALIST: Domestic issues are still proving…you think domestic issues are still there with the voter?

 BEAZLEY: The voter is always concerned to have a government that knows how to defend the nation on the one hand, and defend themselves on the other. They want to know that the Government understands that they do feel pressure on their families. They are worried about whether we can be a clever and creative country when we're letting down our education system so badly and they wonder about their hospitals and aged care. These are things you've got to be able to answer if you're going to run a complete election campaign for the Australian people.

 JOURNALIST: But they've got to give you some confidence that you're punching away at the right message.

 BEAZLEY: I think the message of jobs, health and education is the right message. I think that family living standards is the right message. Leadership commitment, that's the right message. These are the things that the Australian people want to hear in an election campaign. You're not hearing it from the Liberals. They are hearing it from us.

 JOURNALIST: You mentioned the halfway point. How do you rate your chances 2½ weeks out?

 BEAZLEY: Who can tell what the ultimate outcome is going to be. I'm in the business of winning this campaign - that's what I'm trying to do. I want to win this election. I want to win it because I think we have the right ideas, the ideas for Government. Now that they are stating to release domestic policy, it's the sort of pale imitation of what we've been putting forward. Anderson yesterday talking about aged care and regional infrastructure - all within the framework of a package well behind ours, and less well targeted. They are making it up as they are going along. The issue here is jobs, health, education, family living standards and commitment to the long-term from the Prime Minister of this country. Only the Labor Party is really presenting that position now.

 JOURNALIST: What's your response to the 400 asylum seekers who supposedly drowned in Indonesian waters….

 BEAZLEY: I don't have the detail, but it's a major human tragedy if that has occurred. And that is a very sad thing indeed. What it points to is the failure of policy. We have not got the agreement we need with Indonesia in order to be able to ensure that those who put themselves in such danger are not encouraged to do so, that they're not encouraged to come to this country because we've got a right relationship with Indonesia and a right process there.

 That was John Howard's challenge at APEC. John Howard went to APEC and he failed. He went to APEC and he failed on the crucial issue. He needed a conversation - a serious conversation - with President Megawati. He needed a serious conversation about this issue. I have never seen an Australian Prime Minister go to APEC and be unable to have a conversation with the US President and the President of Indonesia. We used to run that show. Its agenda was our agenda. Its needs and concerns were reflections of our needs and concerns. John Howard failed - and failed comprehensively at APEC and he failed in an area in which Australians feel a great sense of insecurity - and that is the protection of our borders.

 JOURNALIST: …policy - $100 million to beef up border protection. No details yet, but what do you think he should….

 BEAZLEY: If it is as advertised in the newspapers this morning, it is a pale imitation of our Coast Guard. What we have from John Howard - a pale imitation of Labor's Coast Guard, pale imitation of Labor's beefing up vital facility protection and the Federal Police and a non-existent effort on his part to get the right agreement with Indonesia to stop the people coming illegally to Australia.
