 Strengthening Australia’s relationship with the Holy See   

 ï· Deputy Prime Minister visited the Holy See, first Ministerial visit to the Holy See since 2014 

 ï· Met with His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State and His Eminence  Cardinal Peter Turkson, Prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human  Development 

 ï· Held discussions focusing on Australia’s global moral responsibility to increase food  production, as well as meeting our international obligations to resettle refugees from the  Middle East    

 Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Barnaby Joyce, has  visited the Holy See, meeting with His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Parolin and His Eminence Cardinal  Peter Turkson, to support the ongoing positive relationship between Australia and the Holy See.    

 Minister Joyce said his discussions focussed on Australia’s global moral responsibility to increase  food production to alleviate world poverty.    

 “Australia is a net exporter of food, and our agricultural resources can play a major role in  increasing global standards of living,” Minister Joyce said.     

 “This is why the Coalition Government is committed to agricultural research and development,  including bringing more land into production by investing in water infrastructure across regional  Australia.”    

 Minister Joyce said the Holy See had a unique role and standing in international affairs, and it was  important this relationship continues.    

 “Australia has a long history with the Holy See, having held diplomatic relations since 1973 and a  resident ambassador appointed to the Holy See since 2008,” Minister Joyce said.     

 “This relationship has allowed Australia to expand dialogue with the Holy See on important global  issues, including human rights, political and religious freedom, global governance and  development, inter-faith dialogue, global and regional security, peacekeeping and conflict  prevention.     

 “During these meetings, I was able to discuss Australia’s commitment to meeting our international  obligations to resettle refugees from the Middle East, including from Syria.

 “And like the Holy See, the Australian Government is committed to the realisation of the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development.    

 “As Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, I have a particular focus upon Sustainable  Development Goal number two, which seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved  nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.     

 “A focus for the government has been ensuring Australian agriculture is well positioned to take  advantage of trade opportunities and support global food security.”     

 Fast facts  ï· First Ministerial visit to the Holy See since 2014  ï· Australia has held diplomatic relations with the Holy See since 1973, when it established  an Apostolic Nunciature (Embassy) in Canberra.   ï· Australia has had a resident ambassador to the Holy See since 2008, when the Hon. Tim 

 Fischer AC was appointed to the role.   ï· The Vatican City State was established by treaty in 1929, providing the Holy See with a  small territorial base and recognition as an independent sovereign entity in international 

 law.

For example, the Holy See has  a Permanent Observer to the UN FAO, Monsignor Fernando Chica Arellano.
