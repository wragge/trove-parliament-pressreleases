 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling BOAT SURGE EXCEEDS 2,000 WITH FIFTH  ARRIVAL IN 48 HOURS March 15, 2013

 The fifth boat in 48 hours, with 102 people on board, means more than 2,000 people have now illegally arrived on 37  boats in 2013, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs  and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “2013 continues to be the fastest start to the year on record for illegal boat arrivals, as the surge that began a week ago  continues,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Despite her constant attempts to distract attention, Julia Gillard cannot hide the fact that the boats keep on turning up  under her chronic border failures.

 “It was Kevin Rudd who started the boats, and Julia Gillard who has failed to stop them. Only an Abbott led Coalition  Government will restore the proven measures and resolve that stopped the boats,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “In the last 48 hours we have seen five illegal boats carrying 306 people arrive to take advantage of the  lax border regime under this Gillard Labor Government.

 “What has become clear is that Labor’s dysfunctional style of governing is a central component of the smugglers business  model, it has been the key to their success in sending over 33,900 people to our shores.

 “The Federal Labor party have attempted to distract the public from their failures however nothing can disguise the fact  that 27,410 people on 443 boats have arrived under Prime Minister Gillard’s watch.

 “The Australian people expect their government to have control over Australia’s borders and while Labor continues to  stumble from one policy disaster to another the boats will continue to arrive in record numbers, making 2013 the people  smugglers’ most successful year yet,” Mr Keenan said.
