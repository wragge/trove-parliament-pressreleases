 Govt funding drought hits arts  

 

 Critical arts programs for disadvantaged Australians are in danger in the wake of  today's dramatic restructure of the Australia Council.    

 The Government's key arts grants organisation has been left with little option but  to take drastic action in the face of a funding drought from the Federal  Government.    

 The Australia Council's triennial funding has stalled, starving the arts of much  needed funds.    

 Small- and medium-sized theatre and dance companies, as well as regional arts  organisations, are also now under a cloud.     

 The restructure comes on top of program and staffing cuts for almost third of the  nation's major performing arts group, including orchestras, dance and ballet  companies, theatre and opera organisations.  

 

 The Australia Council is in danger of being left to carry the can for the  government. The Council is in a double bind: its own funding is effectively frozen  while the financial fortunes of many of its key constituents are deteriorating.   

 The first casualty looks set to be the Australia Council's support for new media  and community arts programs. One such organisation is Kickstart Arts in Hobart,  which works with disadvantaged and refugee groups, as well as others outside  the reach of mainstream arts. The program is highly respected and plays a key  social and cultural role in Tasmania.  

 

 Despite the rhetoric, the restructure is a band-aid solution. It will do little to relieve  pressure on many cultural companies, large and small.   

 Piecemeal changes cannot mask the deeper malaise: the lack of any coherent  vision and commitment to the arts and cultural practice by the Howard  government.
