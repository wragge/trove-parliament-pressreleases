 IMMIGRATION SERVING IMMIGRANTS

 IMMIGRATION SERVING IMMIGRANTS AND AUSTRALIA

 IMMIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA. ARTHUR CALWELL's AND LABOR'S 

 GREAT VISION WAS TO SERVE AUSTRALIA BY BUILDING OUR NATION.

 Two OF EVERY FIVE PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA WERE EITHER BORN 

 OVERSEAS, OR HAVE A PARENT WHO WAS BORN OVERSEAS.

 Wh a t a r e m a r k a b l e  c h a n g e  h a s t a k e n  p l a c e .  T he e x t e n t  t o

 WHICH THE IMMIGRATION PROGRAM HAS SERVED THE ECONOMIC, 

 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL NEEDS OF AUSTRALIA IS NOW PART OF OUR 

 PROUD HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION AND PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN 

 HERITAGE ITSELF.

 OF NEW IDEAS AND SKILLS. THESE HELP THE COUNTRY TO AVOID 

 STAGNATING. IMMIGRATION ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE REPLACEMENT 

 OF SKILLS LOST WHEN AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS GO OVERSEAS.

 INTEREST OVERSEAS ABOUT MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA. AT 

 PRESENT, ABOUT 80,000 CAN BE ACCEPTED, ALTHOUGH I HAVE 

 PLACED ON PUBLIC RECORD MY PERSONAL HOPE THAT WE MAY BE 

 ABLE TO INCREASE THIS TO AROUND 100,000 A YEAR WITHIN A

 FEW YEARS.

 I SAY THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE

 MIGRANT INTAKE IN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR. W e HAVE LAID THE  

 FOUNDATION ALSO FOR A LARGER MIGRATION PROGRAM IN THE  

 FUTURE, INCLUDING INCREASES IN FAMILY MIGRATION, AS THE  

 ECONOMY STRENGTHENS FURTHER, AS NEW JOBS ARE CREATED AND  

 AS UNEMPLOYMENT IS FURTHER REDUCED,

 COUNTRY WITH A PROGRAM SECTION FOR EXTENDED FAMILIES, BY 

 THAT I MEAN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND NON-DEPENDENT 

 CHILDREN. OUR GOVERNMENT WANTS TO BE AS GENEROUS AS 

 POSSIBLE IN PROVIDING THAT MUTUAL SUPPORT WHICH RESULTS 

 FROM HAVING MORE RELATIVES IN AUSTRALIA, BUT THE NUMBERS

 4

 THAT WE CAN ALLOW IN ARE LIMITED, W e ARE OBLIGED TO BE  

 WARY OF PERMITTING PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN  

 THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE JOBS FOR THEM AND THEIR FATE WOULD  

 BE TO JOIN DOLE QUEUES, THAT IS WHY WE NEED A SELECTIVE  

 PROCESS, A RATIONING SYSTEM, WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE  

 NUMBERS QUALIFYING UNDER IT EQUATING, MORE OR LESS, WITH  

 THE NUMBERS AGREED UNDER THAT IMMIGRATION.PROGRAM SECTION.

 PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE LEGALLY WILL BE FACILITATED BY A  

 COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION PACKAGE WHICH

 APPLICANTS TO UNDERSTAND FULLY WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE  

 ELIGIBLE TO APPLY AND HOW TO PRESENT THEIR CASE. I n TURN

 .  74% SAID GREATER EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO CATCH

 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS;

 .  60% BELIEVE THAT VISITORS WHO OVERSTAY SHOULD NOT BE

 ABLE TO CHALLENGE DECISIONS THAT THEY MUST LEAVE;

 .  70% BELIEVE OVERSTAYED VISITORS SHOULD NOT BE

 ALLOWED LEGAL AID AT AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYERS EXPENSE;

 AND

 10

 ,  73% SAID EMPLOYERS WHO KNOWINGLY EMPLOY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD BE FINED OR PUNISHED IN SOME WAY.

 In ADDITION TO THOSE VISITORS WHO DO NOT GO HOME WHEN ‘  

 THEIR ENTRY PERMIT EXPIRES, MY DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT  

 EACH YEAR SOME 30,000 VISITORS, LEGALLY HERE, WORK IN 

 BREACH OF THEIR ENTRY PERMITS. MORE THAN 60% OF ILLEGAL 

 IMMIGRANTS LOCATED HAVE WORKED WITHOUT PERMISSION.

 A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THAT MORE THAN 40% OF ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS AND VISITORS WHO HAD COME TO NOTICE HAD DRAWN 

 ON HEALTH, SOCIAL SECURITY, EDUCATION OR OTHER GOVERNMENT 

 SERVICES. I HAVE EVEN SEEN CASES IN WHICH ILLEGAL 

 IMMIGRANTS HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE HOPING TO GET HOME 

 OWNERSHIP ASSISTANCE. WHEN APPREHENDED, MANY USE LEGAL 

 AID TO CHALLENGE EFFORTS TO ENFORCE OUR MIGRATION LAW.

 I n 1985/86 it w i l l  c o s t  t h e Au s t r a l i a n  t a x p a y e r  m o r e  t h a n $2.5 MILLION FOR THE EXPENSES OF MY DEPARTMENT ASSOCIATED

 POLICY ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

 STATEMENT TABLED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  .IN OCTOBER 1985 BY CHRIS HURFORD, MINISTER FOR  IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 POLICY ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

 INTRODUCTION

 Australia has a planned migration program with selection  processes carefully designed to balance the numbers that  can be settled in various categories. Management of the  program relies heavily on issuing visas and entry permits 

 in good faith to bona fide applicants. Conditions of  entry are specified at the time of visa issue and  reaffirmed at the point of entry. No one can fairly claim  to misunderstand their obligations.

 Illegal immigrants (i.e. those people described in the  Migration Act as "prohibited non-citizens")  threaten the  orderly management of the program. They also jeopardise  Australia's attitude to the acceptance of a very large  number of visitors.

 There will always be limits on the numbers of people  Australia can absorb at a particular time. There will be  a continuing need to balance the numbers that can be  settled in various categories,  such as skilled workers,  

 business migrants, refugees and family reunion.

 For many years the competition for migration to Australia  has been very strong. Most people are prepared to wait  overseas and go through the normal selection processes  including health and character checks. Unfortunately some  people are not prepared to do this. They are not entitled 

 to abuse Australia's immigration policy and laws at the  expense of those waiting overseas or at the expense of  unemployed Australian residents. ,

 It is not open to people from anywhere in the world to  decide, of their own volition, that they will live  permanently in Australia. If, in attempting to do so,  they break Australia's laws, they must expect to face the 

 consequences, including prosecution and removal from  Australia, by deportation if necessary.

 A small proportion of the many people who come to  Australia as visitors fail or refuse to leave. .  There can  be no doubt that many of them intended to do this before  they even applied for a visa; in other words, they 

 obtained their visas by deception. Others claim that  having entered Australia legitimately as visitors, they  decided for one reason or another to remain here after  their entry permit expired.

 2

 "Overstayed visitors",  whatever their reasons, are  unlawfully in Australia. Their status of illegal  immigrants or "prohibited non-citizens" is of their own  making and it must be recognised as such.

 It is an accepted principle of justice and fairness that  people should not derive benefit from an illegal act they  have committed. Illegal immigration is no exception.  Illegal immigrants simply by having succeeded in entering  or remaining in Australia do not earn a right to special  privilege under migration policy, nor does their act of  being in Australia illegally earn them special rights of  review which are not available to those who abide by the  rules and wait overseas.

 The ability of illegal immigrants to remain concealed in  the community, and to support themselves by working -  although without permission-or drawing upon cash benefits  and various public services is sometimes portrayed as a  virtue. Some illegal immigrants claim this as evidence of  their ability to settle in Australia, which deserves a 

 sympathetic response in the form of permission to live  here permanently. The policy can give no such reward for  offences under Australian law.

 WHO ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS?

 Illegal immigrants (those people described as "prohibited  non-citizens" in the Migration Act 1958) are people who  are in Australia without lawful authority. They include.:

 . people who entered Australia as tourists or to visit  family or for other short-term purposes and who have  stayed beyond their visitor-entry permit (they sign  undertakings in visa applications overseas that they  will not seek to stay or take unauthorised employment 

 in Australia; when their undertakings are accepted in  good faith as the basis of their entry as visitors,  the Government expects them to honour those  undertakings);

 . people who are permitted a temporary stay for a specific purpose (for example, for study or training,  for business discussions, for medical treatment or  for working holidays) and then remain (the Government  expects that foreign nationals accorded concessions  such as these on a specific understanding will abide  by that understanding);

 . stowaways, ships' deserters and other clandestine  entrants who by-pass immigration checks

 3

 .  persons who obtain visas and/or entry permits by  false representations, fraudulent or forged  documentation and by other means of deception;

 . previous deportees and people with serious criminal  records overseas who have concealed or failed to  disclose these facts (although such people are not  automatically banned from Australia, a special type  of entry permit may be necessary)

 . persons whose temporary entry permits were cancelled  because they breached entry conditions (e.g. visitors  found to be working illegally) and who have refused  or failed to leave.

 VOLUNTARY DEPARTURE

 It is to be preferred that people who have illegally  entered or illegally stayed in Australia should simply  leave.

 Illegal immigrants who do not leave of their own accord  but who conceal themselves from the Department cannot  expect that when they are apprehended they have some right  to depart voluntarily in order to avoid prosecution and  deportation or the usual embargo that a deportee should  not be allowed back into Australia within five years.

 Visitors to Australia declare that they have a return  ticket and may be asked to show evidence of it before  entering Australia. Any offer to provide an airline  ticket for departure is not a bargaining point to avoid  deportation.

 The opportunity for voluntary departure may be made  available by an officer at the time of an apprehension,  provided there are no indications of the illegal  immigrant's having; .

 .  deceived the Department; or . .  used a false identity; or .  worked without authority; or .  claimed benefits to which he/she is not entitled; or  . committed criminal offences; or .  resisted arrest; or attempted to or actually escaped 

 from custody; or  .  any other adverse record.

 Even if an opportunity for voluntary departure is made  available by an officer at the time of apprehension, due  process will proceed unless, within 48 hours of  apprehension, the illegal immigrant satisfies the  Department that he/she has firm arrangements to leave  Australia by the first available transport.

 4

 As a matter of policy it is for the Minister'or a delegate  to consider in other cases whether the illegal immigrant  should be permitted to stay in Australia and, if not,  whether departure should be by deportation or any other  means. Other than the specific circumstances listed 

 above, the policy does not leave it open to arresting  officers to accept proposals for voluntary departure.

 As a general policy, where a deportation order is already  in existence, it would be unlikely that the order would be  revoked merely to allow a last minute bid for "voluntary  departure", especially if the proposal is on the basis of  personal benefit to the deportee rather than tangible  benefit to Australia.

 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF CRIME

 Foreign visitors who are convicted and sentenced for crime  in Australia, particularly those who have used a visit to  Australia as an opportunity for crime, must expect to face  cancellation of their Temporary Entry Permits. Foreign  nationals who use the opportunity of a visit to carry 

 illicit drugs into Australia should note that the  Australian Government regards this as a serious crime. The Australian community would expect cancellation of  their entry permits and enforced removal from Australia at  the expiration of any prison sentence.

 The interests and rights of the Australian community will  be paramount in such cases. Any deportation ordered in  these circumstances is not a further punishment, but an  action to remove a foreign offender from Australia.

 CUSTODY ,

 Illegal immigrants may be arrested and detained in  custody. The Migration Act provides authority and  procedures for these actions. Arrest and custody,   however, are not inevitable consequences of illegal 

 immigration. Decisions depend upon the circumstances of  each individual case.

 People who have a record of evading the Department,  failing to report or escaping from custody, as well as  those who have not been given permission to enter  Australia (i.e. those who bypassed immigration screening) 

 could expect to be held in custody while their immigration  status and possible removal from Australia are  considered. Persons who have been ordered deported could  expect to be taken into custody to ensure they are  available for deportation.

 5

 As a general policy, children would not be taken into  custody. Immigration Detention Centres are not designed  or equipped with facilities for the long-term stay of  ' children. Nevertheless, where it would be in the 

 interests of a child, especially an infant, discretion  could be exercised to admit a child to an authorised  detention facility.

 Immigration Detention Centres do not have specialised  facilities for women in advanced stages of pregnancy. If  their detention is unavoidable, it would be arranged at an  institution with suitable facilities.

 Illegal immigrants are not detained in prisons unless they  are known to have a significant criminal background or are  violent and disruptive to other detainees or to the  orderly management of a Detention Centre or other special 

 circumstances exist. Where there is no Immigration  Detention Centre, or where there is no further capacity '  available at an Immigration Detention Centre, however,  illegal immigrants may be held in any institution approved 

 for the purpose, including prisons.

 CONSULAR AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE

 Any person in immigration custody may consult with a legal  adviser or a consular representative. The Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will take all reasonable  steps to make the necessary arrangments when a detainee so  requests. Otherwise, as far as possible, the privacy of  detainees is preserved. For example, consular  representatives of foreign Governments and relatives or  friends of detainees are not ordinarily notified that one  of their nationals has been detained unless the detainee 

 specifically requests such notification.

 In some cases, where the detainees do not so wish,  consultation with officials of the foreign government  about travel documents or other administrative matters may  be unavoidable. ‘

 PERMISSION TO WORK

 Australia has a responsibility to its citizens and  permanent residents to provide the maximum opportunity for  employment. Approvals for temporary residents to work are  based on the benefits to the employer, other employees and 

 the economy, while minimising any disadvantages to  citizens and permanent residents. No such selectivity can  be applied to illegal immigrants, and accordingly, the  work they do often leads to the job prospects of  Australian citizens and residents not being as good as 

 they could have been. Illegal immigrants are more likely  to compete for unskilled jobs or work in the underground  or cash economy (avoiding taxation). They are likely to  send savings overseas rather than to spend locally.

 6

 It is not unusual for illegal immigrants who have been  working in Australia to portray as a virtue the fact that  they have supported themselves in this way and to request  that this be taken as an indication that they should be 

 allowed to remain because they would make good settlers.  Besides ignoring the fact that many people who cannot be  accepted for migration in the normal way would make  equally good, if not better settlers, there is no way that  the Government can condone offences against Australian law  by turning them into commendable achievements. It is an  offence under the Migration Act for an illegal immigrant 

 to work without written permission and people who break  the law in this way are liable to prosecution.

 IMPLEMENTATION OF DEPORTATION ORDERS

 Deportation orders are to be put into effect as soon as  practicable. Some delay may be unavoidable if the  deportee is not available for travel e.g. is serving a  gaol sentence, or if the receiving country has not yet  provided travel documents. Apart from practical reasons 

 such as these, however, deportation should take place on  the first available transport unless otherwise ordered by  a Court or agreed by a senior officer in response to  action in a Court challenging the validity of the  deportation order.

 PROSECUTION

 People who commit offences against the Migration Act are  liable to prosecution. The principal consideration in  determining whether a prosecution should be started  (assuming the evidence is sufficient), will be the  Australian public interest.

 For example, prosecutions may require the presence in  Australia of an illegal immigrant (either as respondent or  as a witness) for a specified or indeterminate period.  Whether Australian taxpayers should bear the cost of 

 sustaining such people can only be determined by examining  the circumstances of each case.

 Greater weight would be given to prosecuting an organiser,  ring-leader or profiteer in a racket than to prosecuting a  person whose only substantive offence is that of becoming  an illegal immigrant.

 An offence committed while a person was an illegal  immigrant (e.g. working without authority) is not expunged  upon the grant of some other immigration status.   Prosecution may still proceed.

 7

 THE DEPORTATION DECISION PROCESS

 In deciding whether to order the deportation of an illegal  immigrant, the Minister or his delegate may take into  account a number of factors including:

 . the personal details of the illegal immigrant;

 .  the current and past immigration status of the illegal immigrant;

 .  the history of the person's dealings with the Department and the events leading to the status of  the illegal immigrant including the means by which  the person entered or remained in Australia  unlawfully;

 .  the disposition of family in Australia and overseas;

 .  the personal circumstances of the illegal immigrant as advanced to, or otherwise known to, the  Department;

 .  any new material or compelling circumstances revealed by representations on behalf of the illegal  immigrant;

 .  the avenues of redress available at law to the illegal immigrant;

 .  the Government's policy on immigration and illegal immigration.

 This list of factors is not exhaustive, nor are all of  these factors relevant to every case. The range of  relevant matters can only be determined case by case.

 Moves to consider removing an illegal immigrant from  Australia should start as soon as his or her presence is  known to the Department. It is not necessary for these  processes to be activated only upon the arrest or  physically locating the illegal immigrant.  The  â¢Department's recording systems may reveal sufficient 

 information to activate these procedures when the current  whereabouts of the illegal immigrant is not known to the  Department.

 Simply because illegal immigrants are able to conceal  themselves from the Department does not constitute reason  for the processes to be permitted to discriminate in their  favour, nor to prevent the consideration of their 

 immigration status in Australia or the making of a  deportation order if necessary.

 8

 Illegal immigrants located by the Department should have  an opportunity to present matters to be taken into account  on their behalf. The time for them to take advantage of  this opportunity is not unlimited. As a general policy,

 48 hours is a reasonable period to allow. Refusal by, or  disinclination of, illegal immigrants to take up these  opportunities, or any other lack of co-operation, does not  constitute reason to delay or defer the decision-making  process.

 It is up to illegal immigrants to make the facts known,   especially where those facts are within the personal  knowledge of an illegal immigrant. Although reasonable  access to solicitors and others is facilitated, there is  no obligation on the Department or the Minister to seek  out representation by solicitors, or favourable  representations from others, on behalf of illegal  immigrants.

 REPRESENTATIONS

 Representations on behalf of illegal immigrants and  deportees are considered by the Minister or a delegate.  There can be no presumption, however, that deportation  will be delayed while representations are formulated and 

 considered, especially if those representations contain no  additional relevant information.

 APPLICATIONS TO REMAIN IN AUSTRALIA

 People who wish to remain in Australia should do so  through the normal migration procedures and selection  process overseas.

 The Migration Act severely limits the circumstances under  which people illegally in Australia can change their  immigration status to permanent resident. These limited 

 provisions are not an invitation for people to enter  Australia as visitors, then seek permanent residence when  they should have applied and qualified overseas for entry 

 as migrants in the usual way.

 If a person illegally in Australia makes an application to  remain in Australia, it will be accepted and processed  specifically on the understanding that the policies  outlined in this paper will be applied. A mere statement  that a person wishes to remain, or representations to that  effect, will not be regarded as an application for  permanent residence. Applications should be on the 

 comprehensive application form available from the  Department. An application will not be accepted or  processed unless the prescribed fee is paid.

 9

 If detention is justified, the applicant will not be  released simply because an application has been made to  remain in Australia. The normal considerations relating  to custody are to apply.

 People who are in Australia illegally, whether they  entered without authority or they overstayed their entry  permits, will not readily be given permanent residence  while they remain in Australia. .

 Their breaches of immigration law and requirements will  weigh heavily against them. In particular, in reaching a  decision on an application to remain in Australia, the  following circumstances (if they exist) will weigh heavily 

 against the applicant:

 - the applicant entered Australia unlawfully;

 - the applicant, although entering Australia lawfully,  violated conditions of entry, such as working  without permission;

 - the applicant misled the Minister or an officer in  obtaining a visa or entry permit e.g. fraudulent  documents or false information of a material kind;

 - the applicant avoided contact with, or ceased  contact with, the Department of Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs, or in the case of overseas students,  with the Overseas Students Office, and came to 

 notice because of the applicant's illegal status;

 - the period of illegal residence by the applicant;

 - the applicant has improperly drawn upon Goverment  cash benefits or other services e.g. social welfare .  payments, Medicare, free or subsidised adult migrant  education programs;

 - the applicant has committed offences against  Australian laws (apart from becoming a prohibited  non-citizen or illegal immigrant).

 Changed circumstances advanced in support of an  application to remain (e.g. development of ties in  Australia), but which arose or developed after the expiry  of an entry permit, normally will be given little weight.

 10

 A temporary separation and the costs arising from return  home to apply for migration in the normal manner will not  normally be regarded as mitigating circumstances accorded  significant weight. .

 In the case of applications to remain made after  apprehension,  it will be rare indeed that illegal  immigrants will be granted permission to remain in  Australia.

 Any eligibility for review by the Immigration Review Panel  lapses immediately a person becomes an illegal immigrant,  or is ordered deported under the Migration Act.

 MARRIAGE

 The Migration Act and migration policy provide eligibility  concessions for foreign nationals who have married an  Australian citizen or permanent resident or who have an  Australian citizen child. But eligibility to apply for 

 residence does not carry an automatic entitlement to  residence. In such circumstances, the interests of the  resident family or child are taken into account and are  weighed, along with other factors, in the eventual  decision.

 Marriage to an Australian or the existence of an  Australian citizen child do not confer upon illegal  immigrants the right to choose their country of  residence. Each case will be treated on its own merits.

 Similar considerations apply in respect of defacto  relationships.

 LIMITATION ON RETURN TO AUSTRALIA

 Persons who have disregarded Australia's immigration laws,  those who have been deceptive and those who have broken  their own signed undertakings, must expect some suspicion  if they later apply for another visit to Australia. A  previous record of illegally entering Australia or 

 overstaying an entry permit (whether or not it resulted in  deportation or enforced departure)  is a factor which' can  and should be taken into account in future.  In the  absence of convincing reasons that the person would not  again breach undertakings or become an illegal immigrant 

 such a history can militate against favourable  consideration of re-entry requests.

 The policy of placing general time restrictions on the  return to Australia of former illegal immigrants and  deportees is intended to discourage illegal immigration.  Although the policy is intended to be firm, it recognises

 11

 that some people may well make a case for legitimately  travelling again to Australia. Approval for readmission  to Australia inside the general time limits may be given  in exceptional circumstances.  Each such case would be  considered on its merits overseas at the time, applying  the normal entry policies, rules and procedures.

 In general, people who have been in Australia illegally  would not readily be readmitted to Australia within the  next several years. The general time limitations applied  under this policy are: .

 . people who have been deported from Australia for any reason - five years from the date of their departure;

 . persons who were illegal immigrants detected in the community as a result of departmental enforcement  action but who were not deported, or visitors found  to have worked without authority - three years from  the date of their departure (irrespective of whether  they departed "voluntarily" or under the supervision  of departmental officers); and

 .  people known to have been illegally in Australia and who have departed of their own volition without  departmental enforcement action - 1 year from the  date of their departure.

 People who have overstayed their entry permits for less  than 28 days and left Australia of their own volition  would not normally be subject to any specific re-entry  limitation under this element of the policy although the 

 full extent of their previous immigration history  legitimately may be taken into account in deciding any  future application to enter Australia.

 RECOVERY OF DEPORTATION COSTS

 The Migration Act provides for recovering costs associated  with detaining and removing an illegal immigrant who has  been ordered deported. In the interests of protecting  Australian taxpayers' funds, all reasonable steps will be 

 taken to recover any debt so incurred. Recovery action  should be continued, to the extent practicable, even after  the departure of the deportee from Australia.

 Should a person who has not discharged a debt of this kind  wish to return to Australia, it is expected the debt be  discharged before a visa is granted. But if entry to  Australia is granted without the debt being discharged, 

 then recovery action should be resumed in Australia.

 12

 A person who has been liable to reimburse any costs under  these provisions, but who is not subsequently deported, is  not relieved of the debt. Even if permanent residence is  subsequently approved, the expectation is that the debt 

 should be settled first. If it is not, recovery action  should be instituted.
