 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/253 WEDNESDAY 31 MARCH 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS BARTLETT REJECTS "CASH FOR VISA" ALLEGATIONS, BUT SAYS IMMIGRATION MINISTER HAS FAR TOO MUCH POWER Democrats Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, says the Committee Inquiry into the so-called 'cash for visas' scandal received no evidence to back claims that former Minister Philip Ruddock approved visas in return for political donations, however there are systemic problems.  "The real problem is that, regardless of who is Immigration Minister, the law gives them too much power.  The exercise of the discretion power is far too wide, with no scope for appeal or even proper oversight." Senator Bartlett held the balance of power on the inquiry which has run for 9 months. "No Senator has been more critical of Mr Ruddock's immigration policies and statements than I, but there was no clear evidence to back up allegations of direct corruption," Senator Bartlett said. "The fact that I had a higher success rate than any other MP, when I am the most critical of the Minister's policies, shows that you don't have to give money or be a member of the Liberal Party to get the Minister to intervene on humanitarian cases." "While it is proper for the Senate to investigate allegations of serious Ministerial impropriety, the Inquiry demonstrated that the real problems are with the way the overall power of ministerial discretion has evolved and expanded into a huge number of migration situations.   "I urge the Government to adopt the recommendations of the Committee report. They deal with the real issue, which is that there is a lack of transparency, independence, consistency and fairness in the migration area, particularly in regard to asylum claims.  "The refusal of the current Minister, Senator Vanstone, to allow the inquiry proper access to records was frustrating and unacceptable, and is another sign of a growing trend of secrecy and contempt for the Senate.  However, I did not see this as likely to be covering up for the corruption allegations.  Continued.

 "I support retaining ministerial discretion, but it needs to be in a far more limited capacity.  The  original intention was for Ministerial discretion to be for unusual and extraordinary circumstances.   We need to reduce some of the areas where discretion is now available and introduce codified  criteria for visas in areas where discretion has now become commonplace. 

 "The Committee has made an important recommendation to this effect, particularly to consider  adopting a system of complementary protection for people who do not fit neatly into the definition of  refugee, but still have clear humanitarian reasons why they should not be returned home.  This is the  situation facing many people who have been detained on Nauru for over two years." 

 "Australia is one of the few countries in the developed world that does not have a system of  complementary protection.  The current Australian practice of relying solely on ministerial discretion  does not provide adequate guarantee that genuine humanitarian situations will always be properly  addressed." 

 Senator Bartlett recommends in the report a specific system for complementary protection.
