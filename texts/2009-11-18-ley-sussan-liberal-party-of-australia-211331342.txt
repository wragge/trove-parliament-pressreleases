 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release   

 Christmas Island: Bring your own tent   

 Four unauthorised boat arrivals in the past four days raises the question of where  the Rudd  Government plans to accommodate the overflow of asylum seekers, Shadow Minister for Justice  and Customs Sussan Ley said today.   

 The Immigration Detention Centre on Christmas Island, designed to accommodate 800 is  overflowing with more than 1000 detainees most of them shipped to the island for processing  since the Federal Government changed its detention policy leading to more than 50 unauthorised  boat arrivals since August 2008.   

 The Minister for Home Affairs should state where the next emergency detention accommodation  will be located given that not a sod has been turned on the proposed extension to the Christmas  Island facility which on recent inspection is still a greenfields site, Ms Ley said.   

 The latest arrivals are reported to be being sent to an already overburdened Christmas Island  facility described by elements of the Labor Party in 2008 as a “white elephant”.   

 Any mainland site as a back up to Christmas Island could encourage further asylum seeker  departures, she said.   

 But the rate of recent apprehensions encouraged by the Rudd Government’s watered down  policy could leave it with little choice but to take the mainland option.   

 “The Government also should give a firm assurance that processing will not be fast tracked  simply to accommodate the recent extraordinary flow”, Ms Ley said.   

 “Labor’s failure to protect Australia’s borders and maintain an orderly immigration process is fast  becoming a crisis, particularly on the accommodation front.    

 “Having visited the Christmas Island recently it was clear then that there is simply no place to put  these new arrivals unless the facility resorts to emergency measures including the use of tents”,  Ms Ley said.   

 “And the identification of a mainland option must be just a short step away as the next  emergency step facing the Rudd Government”, she said.
