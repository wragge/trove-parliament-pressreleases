 Minister Launches Report on Safe Haven Experience MPS 117/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today launched a report documenting a key part of the Government's response to the international crises involving Kosovar and East Timorese evacuees in 1999-2000.

 "Learning to Live Again" focuses on the considerable efforts of the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), which was charged with providing information and education services to some 4,000 Kosovar and 1,400 East Timorese in the eight safe havens across Australia.

 "The report is a profound testament to the hundreds of AMEP teaching and support staff across Australia who met the exceptional circumstances prevailing in the safe havens, and embraced so wholeheartedly an unprecedented and enormous task," Minister Ruddock said.

 "The scale of the undertaking meant a massive co-ordination effort between different Commonwealth agencies, state and local government bodies, and community organisations," the Minister said.

 AMEP's services at the safe havens included:

 establishment of schools for children for continuation of studies in their own language while learning basic English; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 vocational training to assist in rebuilding lives on return, offering a range of tuition including fork lift operating, sewing, translating and interpreting, first aid and land mine awareness;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the establishment of resource and information centres where residents âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 could access the Internet; and provision of survival English classes for adults. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "Services provided by AMEP had an extraordinary effect on haven life in building morale, fostering friendships, and providing a vital lifeline for people desperate for news of family, friends or homeland," Mr Ruddock said.

 "As this report makes plain, the Government's safe haven initiatives were an unqualified success."

 AMEP is an acknowledged world leader in the provision of English as a second language (ESL) tuition to migrants and refugees. Established in 1948, its wealth of experience in this respect ideally positioned it to meet the information and education needs of the Kosovar and East Timorese evacuees.
