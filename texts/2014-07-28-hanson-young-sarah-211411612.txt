 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 28 July 2014   

 Australia must assess Sri Lankan  asylum claims before any other country   

 All 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers currently being held in the Curtin detention centre must  understand that they have rights in Australia and the Abbott Government must respect those  rights, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “It’s so important that these people understand that they have rights and that there are  Australians who care about them. That’s why I’ll be travelling to Curtin in the coming days,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “I will be seeking to clarify what medical support is being offered to those families, and  especially the children, while at the Curtin centre.   

 “I fear for what will happen to these children, who have been through a month long ordeal on the  high seas and have now been dumped in the desert.   

 “There is no basis in law for India’s involvement in the assessment of these asylum claims in  Australia.   

 “The Indian Government doesn’t process people’s claims in India, it is all left to the UNHCR,  and they shouldn’t be involved in the process here in Australia.   

 “This is nothing more than a smokescreen from the Abbott Government. Sri Lankan refugees  have made it to Australian soil and they are asking for our help.   

 “They must be assessed by Australian authorities and, if they are in need of protection, kept  safe from their persecutors.”
