 ‘Work for worse than the Dole’ for refugees The Australian Democrats have described the budget measure to introduce activity tests for those on temporary protection visas as callous.

 “Referring to refugees as ‘unauthorised arrivals’ does not justify treating them worse than we do criminals,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

 The introduction of activity tests for those on temporary refugee visas will see some cut off from even the minimal Special Benefit of $164 a week. The rules surrounding Special Benefit are much stricter than unemployment benefits and there is no housing, education or job search assistance available.

 “The Government has gone out of their way to cynically portray these people as criminals out to rort the Australian taxpayer,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The fact is that they have been recognised as genuine refugees. They have a well founded fear of persecution and often have endured terrible trauma and hardship to get here. They are often extremely disorientated and under terrible stress.

 “It is a pretty basic government service to provide a minimum income to refugees in order for them to feed and clothe and shelter themselves. To make that dependent on successfully attending interviews, participating in Work for the Dole or other activity tests does not acknowledge the reality of the situation for some of them,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Many of them have absolutely no resources or family or community networks to fall back on. They may have limited English skills or even a stable home address Yet the Government is prepared to let refugees starve

 if, for whatever reasons, they cannot jump through the Social Security hoops.

 “The government’s own figures show the cost of this measure will be more than what is saved by cutting refugees off payments,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The Government refuses to provide resources to assist refugees, yet another $52 million has been found to build more jails for unauthorised arrivals, some of whom will be found to be genuine refugees.”
