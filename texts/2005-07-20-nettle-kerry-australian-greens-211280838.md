 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 Senator Nettle denied a visa to visit  Nauru  20th Jul 2005 

 The Consulate General of Nauru informed Senator Kerry Nettle today,  that she would not be granted a visa to visit asylum seekers on  Nauru.  Senator Nettle had planned to visit the remaining 32 asylum  seekers on Nauru and assess the situation this week.   

 The letter from the Consulate General said:   “…the visit has been suspended for now as the Government is  currently in the process of revising its position on a number of  issues pertaining to the Overseas Processing Centre on Nauru.   Issues include, amongst others, the access to the Overseas  Processing Centre.     

 Until this and other revisions are completed, all visitations to  the Overseas Processing Centre will remain on hold.”   “I am disappointed that I will not be able to visit the remaining 32  asylum seekers on Nauru.  They have been there for almost four years  now and feel totally abandoned by Australia,” said Senator Nettle.   

 “Given the ongoing failures of the Immigration Department, it is  important that Australians know what is going on in our detention  centre in Nauru. The Australian government must take responsibility  for its decision to hide asylum seekers in Nauru.  

 

  “Australia’s detention centre on Nauru is currently beyond scrutiny. I  can visit the centres on Christmas Island or Baxter, but Nauru is  currently off limits. This move strengthens The Greens continued call  for asylum seekers on Nauru to be brought to Australia.   “I hope the indication that the Government of Nauru is revising its  position on the detention centres will mean that the camps will be  closed. 

  “A memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru about  aid and the detention camps is currently being negotiated. Australia  has a responsibility to develop a respectful relationship with Nauru that  recognises the role Australia has played in depleting the environmental  and economic resources of Nauru.    

 “Australian aid to Nauru must not be tied to the detention centres.   Nauru desperately needs power generation capacity, amongst other  needs, and the generators that were part of the original Pacific  Solution aid deal remain idle and are unsuitable to the Nauruan  environment.    

 “I hope to visit asylum seekers in Nauru in the near future.”
