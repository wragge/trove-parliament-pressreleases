  AUSTRALIA PAYS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS IN RWANDA 

  It is now two years since the tragedy in Rwanda . On this occasion, I am pleased to announce  that Australia will provide $200 000 to assist United Nations human rights monitors in  Rwanda . 

  The funds will be provided to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to  place staff in the field, with the aim of reducing the number and severity of human rights  abuses in Rwanda and investigating the genocide. 

  Despite the difficult security situation, human rights monitors are now in place throughout  Rwanda and are beginning to achieve results . These include training 112 magistrates in  November 1995 and ongoing training for 50 assistant prosecutors to assist in genocide  investigations. 

  A recent report on the operation indicates that the work has paid off and that there has been a  reduction in human rights incidents as a direct result of human rights monitoring and the rule  of law against violators. 

  The move is in line with recommendations in an international report released on 12 March by  the Steering Committee for the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda. 

  The report stated that in order to encourage refugees to return to Rwanda and to begin the  reconciliation and healing process, it was necessary to "insist on compliance with the rule of  law and observance of fundamental human rights principles and monitor closely abuses by the  government" . 

  . The United Nations Human Rights Field Operation is crucial to this process. Australia has  . already provided $300 000 to the operation and this extra grant will enable it to continue with  investigation of genocide and violations of human rights, repatriation of refugees and  rehabilitation of the Rwandan justice system. 

  This brings to more than $45 million the total contributed by the Australian Government to  assist Rwandans since the emergency began.
