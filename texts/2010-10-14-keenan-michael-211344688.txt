 AFP and Customs overcome hurdles to  make record drug seizure   14/10/10  

 The Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service  have overcome hurdles put in place by Labor to successfully complete the third  largest seizure of cocaine in Australian history.  

 

 Despite Labor slashing $58.1 million from cargo inspections in last year’s budget, as  well as resource cuts to both departments, these agencies have proven that the men  and women protecting our borders continue to do their duty against all setbacks.    

 Labor has an embarrassing record of failing to acknowledge the important work these  agencies do.    

 In this year’s budget, the Labor Government revealed it would axe up to 250 staff and  $146.3 million from the Customs and Border Protection Service, and cut the funding  of the Australian Federal Police by $23.5 million.    

 The Labor Government has been making the job of both the AFP and Customs harder  ever since they took office by diverting their resources to manage the tsunami of  illegal boat arrivals.    

 This latest seizure is testament to the determination of the men and women protecting  our borders, and their ability to overcome whatever Labor puts in their way.    

 It is proof of how hard our Customs and AFP officer’s work, despite Labor sending  them out to fight the war on drugs with one arm tied behind their backs.    

 Prime Minister Gillard is showing a complete lack of respect for the job these  frontline agencies are doing.    

 They need more support, not more setbacks, to continue to protect our borders.
