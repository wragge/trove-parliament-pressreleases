  General Comments 

  It is an honour to be addressing you today, on behalf of the Leader of the  Opposition, the Hon. John Howard MP. John sends his best wishes and  hopes the Outlook Conference is a great success. He would have liked to  have been here, but was unfortunately unable to reschedule other 

  engagements. 

  Before I commence my speech proper, T wouJd like to repaffirm where the  CoaHtion stands on immigration and multicultural issues, and what impact  there will be from John Howard's leadership. 

  In September last year, then Opposition Leader A1cxander Downer,  released the Coalition's directional statement, which presented the  b]ueprint for future Coalition policy. That statement included the  following key commitments and goals: 

  â¢ maintain a positive and ongoing immigration program, which has broad  community support, as an integral part of Australia,s nation building 

  â¢ administer the immigration program in a manner appropriate to  Australia's economic circumstances and our family and humanitarian  obligations 

  o continue our longstanding commitment to non-discrimination on the  grounds of religion, race, gender, ethnicity or nationality 

  o ensure tl1at selection is based on a case-by-case assessment of  applicants 

  â¢ re-establish the credibility and accountability of immigration  administration and procedure to rebuild community confidence in its  implementation 

  â¢ improve screening procedure to detect war criminals and those involved  in atrocities or crimes against humanity 

  o introduce citizenship courses and encourage alI pennancnt. residents to  take out Australian citizenship

  â¢ give greater emphasis to English lan&1uage and literacy services 

  â¢ in co-operation with the State, develop and adapt our multicultural and  settlement programs in light of changing needs to guarantee improved  access to them and equjty in their implementation 

  â¢ give a higher priority to the health needs of migrants women and aged  persons 

  â¢ strengthen community input into government policy decisions on  migration and multicultural policies 

  These were t11e 11 key priorities which we identified after widespread  community consultatfon and internal Coalition consideration. They are  supported by all Coalition members and were fulsomely endorsed by the  Shadow Cabinet and Partyroom. 

  John Howard is as committed to them, as Alexander Downer was, and as l  remain. John Howard shares with all Australians pride in Australia as a  nation of immigrants from all comers of the g1obe. lfo is committed to  Australia's ongoing immigration program and our highly successful 

  cultural diversity. 

  I was very pleased to be re-appojnted as the Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and assisting the Leader on Multicultural  Affairs. In the last two years that I have had this portfolio I believe the  Coalition has established an excellent rapport and deve1oped consultative  and co-operative links with multicultural Australia. I very much look  forward to a··continuing strcngt11ened relationship. 

  As John Howard has said, it is the Liberal Party which represents the  values and aspirations most cherished by most Australians, whatever their  origins. We are the Party of individual endeavour and opportunity. We  are the Party which supports the family. We are the Party that promotes 

  and encourages small business. And we are the Party of genuine  tolerance, freedom, diversity, self dignity, and a fair go for all. 

  John Howard and I will be working overtime to ensure that all Australians,  in particular those of overseas origins, are aware and fuIIy appreciate these  Liberal Party values, and the benefits that will flow from a Coalition  Government.

  Introduction 

  I am pleased to be able to participate in this Outlook Conference, and to  put fotward some thoughts on the important subject of 'Population  Movements, Immigration and Australia's Future'. 

  I propose to look at Australia's migration program in the context of global  population movements. J shall also consider the intake program in tcnns  of the overall people flow that Australia has experienced, is experiencing,  and will experience. 

  Australian Immigrntion Facts 

  From the outset Jet me say that the CoaJition believes that the continuation  of a positive ongoing non-discriminatory immigration program is very  much a part of Australiaâ¢s future development as a nation 1â¢ 

  Jnunigration has made a fundamental contribution to Austra1ia's  development. In various waves, migrants have provided skills and energy  which Australia has required for its national progress. From the gold  mshcs and the expansion of agriculture in the last century, to the mass post.  war migration program which helped Australia develop its manufacturing  and industrial base. 

  Australia is very much a nation of immigrants. With 23o/o of the Australian  population today born overseas, we rate amongst t11e very highest in tem1s  of first generation nationals - second only to Israel. By comparison, other  great immigrant societies like the USA and Canada have respectively 9%  and 16% of their populations born overseas. And on top of our overseas 

  born population, of course, another 20% or more are Australian bon1 but  with one or both parents born overseas. 

  But the number of people seeking to remain pcrrnanently in Australia is  rapidly declining as a percentage of total movements to Australia. 

  At tl1e tun1 of the century, virtually all arrivals remained in Australia as  pcnnanent new settlers, whereas today the overwhelming majority of all  arrivals are temporary and depart shortly after their arrival.

  Total arrivals to Australia in 1993-94 were 5.6 million peop1e2 . Although  roughly half of these arrivals are Australian residents traveJling abroad and  then returning afier short overseas stays, this figure ilJustratcs the large  number of people currently arriving in Australia. 

  Total pennanent arrivals in 1993~94 were 70,000 or only 1.25% of total  arrivals. 

  The longer tenn trend of ever lower percentages of people staying  permanently has accelerated in the last decade. 

  In 1984-85, a total of2.7 rni11ion people arrived in Australia. Of this total,  there were 78,000 permanent arrivals, which represented 2.9% of aIJ  arrivals. 

  So in relative tenns - if not absolute ones, where numbers arc similar - the  si&'llificance of immigration has declined to be less than half what it was a  decade earlier. This trend is not, however, unique to Australia. 

  International Migration Movements 

  At the international level, around l mmion popu]ation movements per year  involve "intentional" pennancnt settlement as part of organised national  immigration programs. These people represent only I% of the l 00 million  estimated annual migratory movements. 

  Worldwide the total number of people estimated to be living outside their  national borders is now 100 million. Up from 50 mirnon in 1989. Yet the  number of pennanent migration opportunities is roughly unchanged. 

  Only three countries - Australia, the USA and Canada - have permanent  settlement intake programs of any significance. Of these movements,  Australia takes around 10%, the USA 70% and Canada 20%3. Most other  nations grant permanent residence as the exception rather than the rule. 

  This is not to say that mass population movements are only of interest to  the few countries who fonnally take migrants. Jn fact the reality is often  quite t11e opposite.

  Parliamentary Research Paper No.13 1994, by Adrienne Millbank

  TI1e United Nations has calculated that there approximately 1.8 million  refugees in the world in 1974; 8.4 milJion in 1980; and 19 million in 1994.  The OECD has estimated that there could be up to 40 mi11ion refugees and  dispJaced persons (including those still residing in their home countries).  Two thirds of these people live in camps in Africa, Asia and the Middle  East. 

  Some notable recent examp1es4 are: 

  - fonner Yugoslavia (mainly Bosnia) 1.1 mi1lion displaced/asylum seeking  persons; 

  â¢ Rwanda 2 million; and 

  - Afghanistan 3 .4 million people. 

  Refugees or asylum seekers are only part of the mass population  movements that are now common across the globe. 

  The second major group of mass people movement in modem times is  those who are seeking work. 

  Illegal work·seeking immigrants constitut.c a major problem in many  countries. The United Nations estimated that in 1991 the number of iJlcgal  workers could be about 30 m1J1ion. With the subsequent collapse of  communism and the rise in intra·national ethnic conflicts, that figure is  now considered to be much hjgher. 5 

  But the level of legal workers is also significant. One recent estimate put  the figure of legal and illegal workers in foreign countries at about 70  million<>, if the UN's 30 million estimate of illegals is subtracted that leaves  40 miUion legal foreign workers. 

  While these figures are difficult to verify, a Newsweek article late last  year7 provided a breakdown of the numbers for Asia. It reported 4 million

  (legal and illegal) East Asians working in other Asian countries. They  consthuted 800,000 Indonesians, 600,000 Philippines, 400,000  Bangladeshis, and 400,000 Thais. Most of them are employed in low to  semi-skilled jobs. But these jobs, nonetheless, more ofien than not provide  better opportunities for the workers, than they had in their home countries. 

  The third major group of mass people movement is related to the  globalisation of the world economy. Not only has trade of goods increased  in the last 50 years, but tJ1e trade of services - which often involves people  movements - has also increased dramatica11y, and in the last 10 in 

  particu1ar. 

  This trade in services has fuelled the flow oflarge numbers of tourists,  students, businessmen and professionaJs. Falling real transport costs and  increased global communications have also encouraged this trend. 

  Implications for Australia 

  Australia is uniquely placed in the world community as a peaceful island  state whose geographical position and landscape makes us a distant  country for most mass population movements. We are able to police our  borders like virtually no other country. This means we have a greater 

  capacity than most nations to decide who can and cannot enter our  territory and remain on it. 

  In this cmcial respect our 'isolation' is a plus, other tlrnn for our ability to  attract tourists. 

  Australia must deal with the three groups- mentioned above in an orderly,  systematic and deliberate manner. We need to address these matters in  our national interests, while talcing into account international obligations  and circumstances. But at no stage should we cede our soverci&rnty over  these issues to overseas interests. 

  DeaHng with 'illegals' 

  This can be the most sensitive and difficult area in which to get an  appropriate 'balance' in policy. Opinions frequently are strongly divided. 

  This has been particular]y so in some overseas countries. For example, the  Proposition 187 resolution, dubbed 'Save Our State', carried by a 2/3rds  majority in the Ca1ifomian elections, last November, brought this debate to 

  7 

  .\l JIM SHORT Mt:L.tJ. lLJ: U-:>41 ~b-:>'.:>U 

  the fore of American pub1ic poJicy debate. TI1is resolution - now subject  to Supreme Court cha11cngc - denies all illegal migrants access to all non­ emergency public services. It was widely acknowledged that this  resolution arose out of a rising anti-immigrant feeling in some US states  with high migrants levels, and in particular high illegal migrant levels. 

  Without going over the respective argwncnts related to the US experience,  the lesson it has for Australia is that iftl1e situation gets out of control then  people wi11 turn to severe measures to address it. h1 the US example, this  reflects a degree of desperation by Americans about their inability to 

  effectively control the influx of illegal migrants, especiaJly from Mexico8â¢ 

  Australia accepts one of the highest levels of refugees per capita in the  world. Our current humanitarian and refugee program is l 3,000. This  compares to about 125,000 taken by the USA, the largest official resettling  nation. 

  Australia has recently witnessed a number of challenges to our orderly  managed humanitarian intake. A recent challenge was of course the  40,000 odd Peoples Republic of China (PRC) students who sought to stay  here in the aftermath of the Tienanmen Square massacre. The Government  has sought to resolve this by allowing all 28,000 pre-Tienanmen9 PRCs to  stay pennancntly, and to establish two new visa classes, 816 & 818, with  8300 places this year. for the post-Tienanmen PRC to apply for. The  latest processing figures 10 show: 25,022 pre-Tienanmen M visa class 815 -people have been approved, 45 have been withdrawn, 26 have been  rejected, and 2219 are stfll to be processed; 1726 applicants have been  approved for 816, 128 withdrawn, 2311 rejected, and 14,791 are still to be  detennined; and 346 applicants have been approved under the 818  category, 11 withdrawn, 804 rejected, and 1951 are to be detennincd. 

  Another challenge to our orderly humanitarian procedures comes from tl1c  influx ofboatpeople. Since 1989 almost 1800 have arrived on our shores  illegally. Last year a1one 953 people arrived on 18 boats. These boat  arrivals pose a serious problem for government. Some of these people are  genuine asylum seekers, but most are simply seeking a better quality of

  life 11 . It is importunt that the government strikes an appropriate balance  between, on the one hand, sending a c1car signal tl1at our sovereign borders  cannot be readily transgressed and our orderly migration program  undennined, and, on the other, that we are fulfilling our international  obligations and humanitarian responsibilities to genuine refugees fleeing  persecution. 

  We need an efficient, effective and fair process for dealing with these  people. To be fair it must take account of all the other applicants for entry  into Australia as refugees, or on humanitarian grounds, who are in third  countries awaiting resettlement. Australia docs well on an international 

  sca]e on these counts, but there is room for improvement. 

  Dealing with foreign workers 

  Australia has I believe been wise in not following many European, Middle  Eastern and Asian countries lead by encouraging 'guest worker'  arrangements. We have aJways had a preference for ponnancnt settlement  of semi or skilled workers to meet Australian Jabour demands, rather than  those so-called temporary arrangements. This has meant we do not have  ]arge numbers of people residing here who do not have access to 

  citizenship or permanent residency. 

  The skilled intake of the 1994-95 immigration program is 25,000 and the  de facto skills assessed concessional family category is l 0,500, totalling  35,500. Under these arrangements Australia gains valuable skilled  workers - albeit some of whom are of a less high calibre since the point  test passmarks were dropped in December l 993 - who are also committed  to pennancnt residence in Australia. They are not transient workers, they 

  arrive through legal avenues, and usually with their immediate family  reinforcing the nature of long tenn commitment. 

  Having said that, however, we do need as well to recognise that the  workforce is becoming increasingly intemationa1ly mobjJc. This is  particularly the case with highly ski11cd professional experts. Such people  may wish to come to Australia for a relatively short period, make a 

  contribution, and then move on to other fields in other countries. 

  11  Department oflmmigral.lon & Ethnic Affairs 'Fact Shed' shows 397 people have been granted  entry - mainly rcfugcc status, as at 5 December J 994

  We need to make sure that our systems do not inhibit these people from  making that contribution. Otherwise, as a nation~ we would be the Joscr.  Our policies and their administration must facilitate such people  movements whilst at the same time protecting the integrity of our orderly  immigration program. 

  Dealing with services trade 

  The rapid expansion in services is the way of the future for developed  nations. If Australia is to retain its high Jiving standards, we must actively  and competitively engage in wor]d services trade. Thal means both  exporting our services and importing overseas ones. Either way there are 

  significant people movements involved. 

  The more tlmn doubling in arrivals (and departures) to Australia in the last  9 years is primariJy due to increased services trade - namely tourism. Tbe  number of visitor arrivals has tripled from 1.1 million to 3.2 mil1ion from  1984-85 to 1993-94. Of these, about 2/3rds are here on 'holiday' .12 

  This is one area where the "control" concerns are often relegated to Jow  priority. Australia, Jike most nations, is keen to encourage businessmen  and tourists to their shores. They bring capital, expertise, and spending  power, all of which enhance the local economy. 

  The number of people movements (arrivals and departures) has ucarly  doubled from 6 million in 1986 to 11 mimon in l 993 13. Various estimates  suggest the figure could reach at least 20 million by the turn of the century. 

  TI1is puts enonnous pressure on Austra1ian authorities to maintain the  integrity of our entry system while ensuring expeditious entrance  arrangements. 

  There are estimated to be around 70,000 visa overstayers here. 43,000 (or  63%) of overstayers are visitors, 14,000 are students (60% of whom are  PRC). and 5000 are temporary residents 14 â¢ 

  In this area more than any other, Australia needs to make sure that its visa  system keeps up with international developments. Tt should be

  inexpensive to applicants, ensure a high level of border integrity, be able to  be processed quickly either on, or prior to, arrival in Australia, and be  designed to be as least intrusive as possible. You may be aware that the  Federal Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration this week  has commenced its public hearings of an inquiry into Austra]ia' s visa 

  system. 

  Conclusion 

  We live in an age of people movement. More people are on the move  today, both in absolute and relative numbers, tlian at any time in the  world's history. 

  The speed of transportation makes crossing the globe Jess than a day's  outing. The cost of transport is also cheaper than ever, being accessible to  most people in the Western world and increasing numbers in the  developing world. 

  This greater speed, and lower cost, of transportation, p1us instant  international communicatfons al low cost have removed at least some of  the old "tyranny of distance,, factor facing potential long tenn new settlers  in Australia. 

  Those developments arc occurring in a world which still has far too many  brutal civi1 wars, despotic rulers, downtrodden people, and huge  differences in Jiving standards and quality of life. All these come together  to make the prospects of future mass movement all the more JikcJy. To  ignore the potential implications for Australia would be to have our heads  very finnly buried in the sand. 

  Australia's migration program provides an opportunity for pennanent  movement of people. Our open economy and international outlook further  encourage transitory movements through our country. 

  Our migration policies, programs, and administration must pay f uIJ regard  to all these issues. What has served us well in the past cannot be  guaranteed to serve us equally in the future. As in many other areas, we  must be prepared to adjust our policies, to take the best from the past and  buiJd on it for the future. 

  The Australian people have high expectations of the ability of our  governments to preserve the sovereignty of our borders whilst pursuing an

  immigration policy that benefits Australia and meets our legitimate  international obligations. The integrity of our programs must be of the  highest order to ensure we can deal with these 20th century people  movement phenomena efficiently, effectively and responsibly.
