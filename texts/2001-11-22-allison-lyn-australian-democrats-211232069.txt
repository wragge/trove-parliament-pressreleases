 AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRAT SPEECHES

 Senator Lyn Allison Portfolio: Energy and Resources Related: Environment

 Dated: 22 Nov 2001 Location: Sydney

 Australian Institute of Energy speech: Dealing with myopia -ensuring a far-sighted vision for Australia's energy future

 Thank you for inviting me to open this important conference. I’m very pleased to be here.

 Your conference theme is “exploring Australia’s energy future.”

 I want to put the proposition that Australia’s energy future must not just simply be more of the same.

 When I look at ABARE’s projections for primary energy consumption by fuel for 2019-20 which has the proportion of black coal consumption at 24.8%, brown coal 9.4%, oil 35.6%, natural gas 23.9% and renewables at only 6.3% up only 0.4% from 1998/99 - I don’t like what I see.

 And, I strongly believe that this doesn’t have to be the case, but that it will take visionary policies and real leadership for us to change direction and move off the status quo express.

 We need to reduce the growth in electricity consumption through demand side management and significantly reduce the emissions intensity of the electricity we produce.

 The efficiency of our electricity generation in terms of greenhouse actually dropped in the ten years to 1999. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 36% on 2000 levels by 2010.

 I make no apologies for the fact that the Democrats would like to see the Australian economy - our society - predominately based on renewable energy by 2030. We also see an important role for natural gas and for the use of cogeneration.

 The Cogeneration association says the growth in electricity demand could be taken up entirely with cogeneration projects - that’s how much potential is out there in heat that is currently being wasted.

 We need real energy market reform that has environmental sustainability as a core objective. We need to remove the barriers to low emission electricity generation and promote market driven investment in clean energy.

 And customers need to be much more aware of the greenhouse impact of their energy purchasing decisions. Power bills need to show where the electricity comes from and what it means in tonnes of greenhouse gases.

 Long term, much more renewable energy has to be the answer.

 The simple fact is that our reliance on fossil fuels is not sustainable. While our use of fossil fuels has made our society rich by world standards, the negative effects, including the threat of climate change, are now just too great.

 This point was reinforced to me only a couple of weeks ago. I was asked to help launch Lonely Planet’s pictorial on the very beautiful Tuvalu. For those of you who don’t know Tuvalu is a tiny group of islands located in the Pacific, to the northeast of Australia.

 The Tuvaluans are extremely concerned about sea level rise, given that the highest point on the island is only five metres above sea level. Each year, the Tuvaluans watch as more and more of their beachfront is washed into the sea.

 The Tuvaluans predict that within 50 years their island will be uninhabitable, and that 10,000 people who live on the island will become “greenhouse” refugees.

 Tuvaluan officials have already been to Australia to ask the Australian Government to ratify Kyoto and to accept their people as refugees when Tuvalu becomes uninhabitable.

 The irony is that, like so many other Pacific neighbours, they have now been asked to accept the asylum seekers who Australia refuses to process on our shores.

 We are strongly opposed to this approach to asylum seekers, just as we are the ‘it’s not our problem’ approaches to climate change policy.

 In fact we think there are a few parallels. Short-term populist political considerations rather than a genuine attempt to find a workable solution and a general lack of sustainability come to mind.

 I think real leadership as a global player would mean a willingness to show the way in relieving the poverty and other root causes of asylum seeking and to grasp reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions with enthusiasm and lots of sticks and carrots.

 Lets have a proper talk too about mandating a domestic emissions trading system or a carbon tax.

 If there is one thing I would wish for at this conference is a serious challenge of the mantra that reducing our greenhouse emissions will cost jobs and hurt Australian industry.

 When interviewed on the 7.30 report after the election, the Prime Minister mentioned that one of the main reasons why his Government would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol is because of the concern that “dirty industries” - and I’m using the Prime Minister’s words here - will leave Australia and set up shop in other, developing countries.

 He said that if the Government ratified Kyoto, it would be agreeing to the export of manufacturing and industrial jobs from this country and that the unions would be rightly angered by this.

 I don’t think so. It’s the economic risks of not taking action that we should be worried about.

 The sceptics are still with us but the considered work of thousands of reputable scientists can’t be ignored.

 CSIRO Atmospheric Research projections released in May this year confirmed the projections made in 1996 which are:

 â Greater warming inland â Decreases in winter rainfall over the continent but increases in Tasmania â Uncertainty on the direction of change for summer rainfall over most of the continent

 The differences they found in 2001 were: â The projected warming rate was higher, particularly at the high end of the uncertainty range â The magnitudes of rainfall change are generally higher

 And anyway, ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is not the huge ask that it’s made out to be. By any measure we got a good deal out of the rest of the world - a testament to the negotiating skills of our environment minister.

 Because Australia is able to include emissions from land clearing in our emissions profile for 1990, and because emissions from land clearing have fallen substantially between 1990 and 1997, even if land clearing rates do not continue to decline, the fossil fuels sector can increase emissions by at least 122 per cent over 1990 levels. This would still keep us within the 108 per cent target.

 The second mantra that needs to be challenged is that developing countries aren’t doing anything to reduce their emissions needs more careful evaluation. The World Resources Institute, reports:

 “Over the past 20 years, China has taken concrete steps to conserve energy and reduce emission growths growth while simultaneously raising standards of living. Without price reforms and energy efficiency gains, China’s emissions would be more than 50% higher than current levels. Per dollar of GDP, China has cut its carbon emission levels in half since 1980. This is an unprecedented “de-coupling” of carbon emissions and economic growth, relative to any other country.”

 Thirdly, the risk to Australian jobs is grossly over exaggerated - we are getting quite good at doing this. And I notice the ‘jobs card’ is always played in defence of logging in native forests but doesn’t rate a mention in bank closures.

 Much has been said over the past few years about ABARE’s MEGABARE model. In The Heat is On, the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, which I chair, the Committee said:

 “economic modelling undertaken to estimate the costs of emissions abatement have been generally characterised by a lack of public scrutiny, flawed assumptions, a failure to incorporate costs from inaction, and a failure to acknowledge the full scope for the uptake of low and negative cost energy efficiency opportunities.

 Criticism has also been levelled against the modelling used in the Allen Consulting Groups report entitled, “Meeting the Kyoto Target: Impact on Regional Australia.” Some of the claims made in this report were that complying with the Kyoto Protocol would reduce Australia’s GDP by approximately 1.9 per cent per year and that employment will fall by almost 40 per cent more in non-metropolitan than in metropolitan areas.

 An independent review of this report found nine errors with the modelling, and disputed the reports findings about job losses, saying instead that the fossil fuel based industries are likely to grow considerably while Australia meets its Kyoto commitments for the reasons already mentioned.

 The report states:

 “The fact that some of these claims have been based on results generated by complex and sophisticated economic models does not diminish the ‘bunkum factor’; indeed it only serves to conceal insupportable claims behind a veneer of analytical respectability, as economic models are especially prone to the GIGO problem, garbage in-garbage out.”

 What seems clear to me in discussing the effects of meeting Kyoto is that we are not focussing on the opportunities anywhere near enough.

 I was pleased last week, however, to hear that Victorian Departments and statutory authorities will be required to reduce energy consumption in government buildings by 15% by 2006 and to use more renewable energy.

 The Victorian Minister said that these initiative would lead to job growth in renewable energy industries in regional areas - those areas where job growth is needed the most. She says 14 new jobs are created from every megawatt of renewable energy installed!

 Clearly, as many analysts argue, the challenge facing our Commonwealth and State Governments is not to determine whether or not Australia needs to reduce emissions by a significant amount.

 They are going to have to do this anyway - the question is whether we start doing this now, and comfortably manage the transition to a sustainable energy future, or wait until much later, when opportunities in clean green new industries will have been lost and when it will be harder for Australian industries and people to make the transition because change will be thrust upon us.

 I don’t mean to be suggesting here that some industries and people will not be affected by reducing our greenhouse emissions. Analysts argue that regions, like the Latrobe and Hunter Valleys are going to need transitional assistance and they should receive this. I might add that they didn’t receive assistance when thousands of jobs were lost in the restructuring of the electricity industry and the Latrobe Valley in particular is still bearing the social cost.

 But this shouldn’t be a reason for not moving forward with other countries to tackle climate change, which leading scientists agree is going to have a disproportionately high impact on Australia.

 We must develop policies, which are in the long-term interest of all Australians, and seek to deal with the impact on those who will be most adversely affected. We can do it. We have had success in reducing air pollution, we have started to reverse ozone depletion.

 I want to finish by talking briefly about what the Democrats will be pressing for over this next parliamentary term.

 â We will argue for an increase in the amount of additional energy which must come from renewable sources to at least 10% by 2010. Our 9,500 Gwh target is far too low to stimulate the kind of investment we need in the renewables sector. And as we learnt a couple of months ago, this target will probably only represent, in reality, an additional 0.5% in renewable energy, because of the large growth in electricity consumption that is expected.

 â We want the Government to focus much more on cogeneration. We believe that industry should double the cogeneration market share from 5 to 10% by 2010 and that we should develop an aggressive national plan in order to achieve this.

 â We will be pressing for more appropriate planning approvals processes for sustainable energy producers.

 We realise that this is going to be quite a challenge because of opposition to the establishment of wind energy farms in particular. Only last week there was an article in The Age newspaper from a about the National Trust’s nervousness about windy sites along our coastlines. It should not be necessary for us to go offshore like the Danes if our incentives are in place to make lower order sites viable for wind farms.

 â We want to talk in greater detail with industry, business and community leaders about the development of a carbon tax - how it might operate, how impacts on the poorest members of our community could be avoided.

 Britain now has a Climate Change Levy at around $A12/MWh. The $3billion that raises is being ploughed back into energy efficiency measures.

 President Bush is offering tax benefits to promote cogeneration and a $US17/MWh tax credit for renewable generation projects.

 We agree with the OECD that a carbon tax or an emissions trading system is the best way to put our economy on a sustainable path. We think that the money raised from a carbon tax, or call it what you like, should be reinvested in energy efficiency and renewable energy development.

 â In my home State of Victoria, I will be watching very closely the impact of full retail contestability on electricity production and consumption.

 I strongly believe that any reform of our electricity market must have ecological sustainability as one of its key goals. It’s important that the expansion of choice also means more choice about where that electricity comes from.

 I think its far to say that green energy schemes have not lived up to their potential, and that much more needs to be done to encourage consumers to choose green energy solutions.

 â We will continue to look at the progress being made in the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology.

 I know that the team at the UNSW Research Centre on Materials Interfaces is doing some very interesting work on developing hydrogen energy from solar power and although we are some years away from commercial application, I believe that these endeavours should be given our support.

 In conclusion, I’d like to finish on the point that the key to a sustainable energy future is not just one that is ecologically sustainable, it must be socially and economically sustainable as well. With this in mind, we must plan for a sustainable energy future that addresses not only our own domestic needs but global ones too.

 It’s becoming much clearer to those involved in environment policy that our energy and material use lies at the heart of the world’s environmental problems.

 And as the quality of our environment is central to the well-being of our society and our economy, I

 strongly believe that energy issues must be given much higher priority than they currently are.

 British Prime Minister, Tony Blair said recently: Green technologies are on the verge of becoming one of the next waves in the knowledge economy revolution. I want Britain to be a leading player in this coming green industrial revolution.

 Well that’s what the Democrats want for Australia too.
