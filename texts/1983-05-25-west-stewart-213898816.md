 BOOKLET TO HELP MIGRANTS SETTLE IN CANBERRA REGION

 A 64-page handbook providing newly-arrived migrants and refugees 

 in the Canberra region with basic local settlement information 

 was launched today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic 

 Affairs,  Mr Stewart West.

 "I am certain that migrants and refugees will benefit greatly 

 from its wealth of helpful, up-to-date, and simply-organised 

 relevant information that has a strong local bias," Mr West 

 said.

 The "Migrants' guide to community services in the Canberra region 

 contains 23 broadly-based topics of specific interest to new 

 arrivals, including education,  employment,  health,  the legal 

 system,  migrant facilities,  money,  motoring,  recreation and 

 entertainment,  safety,  and welfare.

 Bilingual Information Instructors and staff at the Canberra 

 Regional Office of the Department produced the guide in coÂ­

 operation with other community and Government agencies.  The 

 guide is being translated into Vietnamese,  the language which 

 is most in demand in the region, and will be regularly updated.

 Copies of the booklet are being given to all migrants (including 

 refugees) in the Canberra region who have arrived since the 

 start of the year,  to new migrants on arrival,  and also to 

 community and Government service providers who deal with migrants
