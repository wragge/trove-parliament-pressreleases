 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 25 March 2014   

 Greens to order turn-back footage from Government in  attempt to clear Navy’s name   

 The Australian Greens will give notice of a motion in the Senate today, ordering the Government to  produce any footage recorded during a controversial tow-back that took place in early January.   

 “This Government’s obsession with secrecy has turned Operation Sovereign Borders into Operation  Blame the Soldiers,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “There is footage of the incident and, if this Government really cared about clearing the Navy’s  name, they would end the secrecy surrounding this turn-back.   

 “Bullying the media into ignoring the story and shouting down your opponents isn’t an appropriate  response to these serious allegations.   

 “Letting a cloud of suspicion gather over the brave Australian men and women who are  implementing the Government’s dangerous policies is a cowardly move from the Coalition.   

 “When this motion passes the Senate, the Government will have a clear choice to make. On One side  is the power of the Parliament and an opportunity to clear the Navy’s name while on the other is the  Government’s arrogance and more self-interested secrecy.”
