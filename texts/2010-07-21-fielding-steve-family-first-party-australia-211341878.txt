 MEDIA RELEASE   Tuesday July 20 2010 

 

 COCKY GILLARD HASN’T STOPPED THE BOATS   

 Family First Leader Senator Steve Fielding says Julia Gillard shouldn’t be so cocky with her attempt to  stop people smuggling after another 84 asylum seekers were taken to Christmas Island today.   

 Senator Fielding says the PM has given the appearance that’s she’s doing something to stop the boats but  in reality there’re just going to keep on coming under her Government.   

 “This latest boatload could be Tampa 2 and define the election," Senator Fielding said.   

 “I have little doubt people will see through Gillard’s flawed plan, which won’t stop the boats and won't fix  this escalating problem.   

 “The only way to stop the boats is to make sure we don’t give the people smugglers something to market.   

 “I’m sure Tony Abbott is hoping the boats keep on coming for the next five weeks despite his claim that  he wants to stop them.”   

 Senator Fielding said he remains convinced that the best way to stop the tsunami of boats is to send queue  jumpers to the back of the line in refugee camps around the world. 

  “Labor’s approach might look like a quick fix but it reeks of a desperate Government trying to cover up  an escalating problem,” Senator Fielding said. 

 “Every time we accept a refugee into our country by boat, another refugee waiting patiently in a camp  somewhere else is forced to wait even longer.  

 “There are thousands of refugees patiently waiting in line in camps across the world trying to gain asylum. 

 “Boat people have no right to push them further down the queue and this proposal would stop this from  happening. 

 “This scheme would save millions of dollars as well as countless lives and put an end to the people  smuggling trade into Australia. 

 “Australia is a fair and compassionate country and we should do our fair share to help refugees, but we  should not encourage queue jumpers. 

 “If the Gillard Government is serious about stopping the boats then this idea should be adopted  immediately.” 

 Under the proposal, Australia would take two refugees from the front of the queue for every boat person  trying to enter the country.
