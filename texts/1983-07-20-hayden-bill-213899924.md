 2. AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE WELCOMED THE ANZUS DELEGATIONS, THE   COUNCIL MEMBERS REVIEWED THE ANZUS ALLIANCE. IT WAS THE FIRST SUCH   REVIEW SINCE THE ANZUS TREATY WAS SIGNED IN  195 1.  THEY NOTED THAT,   ALTHOUGH INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC' CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH  

 PREVAILED AT THAT TIME HAD CHANGED, IT  I S  A SIGN OF THE RESILIENCE OF   THE TREATY THAT IT REMAINS RELEVANT AND VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE   SHARED SECURITY COUNCERNS AND STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF THE THREE  

 PARTNER GOVERNMENTS.

 3. THE COUNCIL MEMBERS AFFIRMED THAT THE ALLIANCE I S  FIRMLY BASED ON   THE PARTNERS’ COMMON TRADITIONS AND CONCERN TO PROTECT DEMOCRATIC   VALUES.

 WITH THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES.

 5. THE COUNCIL ALSO REAFFIRMED THAT THE ANZUS TREATY I S  AN AGREEMENT   BETWEEN SOVEREIGN AND EQUAL STATES COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC   TRADITION. I N  ACCORDANCE WITH THAT TRADITION, THE RESPECTIVE STATES   WOULD AT TIMES HAVE VARYING VIEWS AND PERSPECTIVES ON VARIOUS  

 INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. SUCH DIVERSITY DOES NOT   AFFECT THEIR SOLIDARITY UNDER THE ANZUS TREATY, THE MAINTENANCE OF   WHICH REFLECTS THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF THE THREE PARTNERS.

 6. IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE ALLIANCE FURTHER AND RECOGNIZING THAT   NATIONAL SECURITY CANNOT BE ASSURED BY MILITARY STRENGTH ALONE, THE   COUNCIL MEMBERS CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL COOPERATIVE   MEASURES:

 —  THEY AGREED THAT ANZUS CONSULTATIVE PROCESSES COULD BE   STRENGTHENED THROUGH FURTHER PERIODIC ANZUS OFFICIALS TALKS.
