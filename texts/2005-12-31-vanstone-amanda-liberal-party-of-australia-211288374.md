 Queensland or Else for Many Settlers

 Where else but Queensland trumpeted more than 22 000 migrant and refugee entrants in 2004-05, which is the largest number to Queensland under  this Coalition Government.

 Glorious beaches, tropical rainforests and warm weather appealed to plenty of people from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, China, South  Africa and Sudan.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, with about  2000 more people settling in Queensland compared to last year’s total of 20 284.

 Senator Vanstone said the arrivals in Queensland had increased by 58 per cent in the past 10 years, with just 13 000 settlers in 1994-95.

 On the national front, more than 123 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2004-05, up 40 per cent annually on the 1994-95 figures.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
