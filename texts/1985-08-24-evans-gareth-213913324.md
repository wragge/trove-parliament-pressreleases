 The achievements of the United Nations were too often  

 underestimated or taken for granted, the Minister for Resources  

 and Energy and Acting Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, said  

 today.

 1  One source of disillusionn).ent with the UN lies in unrealistic

 providence which could be called down to solve the world’s  

 problems. Only when we approach it with realistic expectations

 Senator Evans was speaking to the United Nations Association of  

 Australia in Surfers Paradise. A copy of his address is  

 attached.

 He said there was no justification for the view that Australia  

 did not need its own Bill of Rights because UN instruments  

 provided sufficient protection (see p.Ilff of the speech). The  

 need for such domestic legislation was underscored by

 . the fact that, under Australian law, international  

 conventions did not become part of this country's laws  

 without specific authorising legislation;

 t

 . the requirement of most of the UN's Human Rights treaties 

 for supporting domestic legislation; and

 . the observance of domestic remedies being an integral part 

 of the UN approach to the protection of human rights.

 'The bottom line in the argument is simply this: while the UN

 conventions are admirable expressions of an ideal, and do have 

 a weight, force and momentum of their own, individual nations 

 like Australia have to enact their own laws and enforcement 

 machinery if those ideals are to be fully secured,1  Senator  O Evans said.

 Other major points he made in the address include: ·

 . the UN's most tangible and practical achievements being in

 THE UNITED NATIONS AT 40: AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE

 H.V. EVATT MEMORIAL LECTURE.

 Address by the Minister for Resources and Energy,  and the  Acting Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans QC , to the  United Nations Association, Surfers Paradise, 23 August 1985.

 It is an honour for me to be invited to deliver the H.V. 

 Evatt Memorial Lecture on the subject of the United Nations 

 at age 40. I hope the invitation owes something more to my, 

 and the Labor Government's, commitment to the UN than the 

 coincidence of our birthdays!

 It is a particular privilege to give an address in honour of 

 Dr Evatt, a truly distinguished Australian who contributed 

 so much to our law, diplomacy and public affairs. As a 

 leader of the party to whi,ch I belong, his life and career, 

 exhibited a commitment to principles which I overwhelmingly 

 share.

 Doc Evat,fc > s-  career was an extr aodinar ily colourful and 

 varied one, an almost equal mixture, in retrospect, of 

 heroic achievement, tragedy and farce - but throughout that 

 career he consistently demonstrated the strengh of his 

 commitment to principle in ways that are still exemplary and 

 inspiring.

 As Australia's Foreign Minister, Evatt played a central role 

 in the founding of the United Nations. He was centrally 

 involved in the drafting of the UN Charter at the San 

 Francisco Conference in 1945. His crucial role, and that

 -2-

 for which history will possibly most remember him, was to 

 protect and enhance the position of the smaller nations, 

 including Australia, and to strengthen the UN's role in 

 economic and social development. He saw the United Nations 

 as a great opportunity for the international community to 

 secure peace and establish a framework for international 

 relations which would advance the social and economic 

 well-being and the political and civil rights of mankind. 

 He would have been vitally interested in - and I add, 

 concerned about - its progress and prospects after 40 years.

 During that period Australia has remained committed to the 

 United Nations and has been active in many aspects of the 

 work of the UN. Ours was the first permanent mission

 accredited to the United Nations in New York. Norman Makin, -  . '' ;

 Australia has served on many other bodies such as the  

 Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the  

 International Court of Justice and the board of the UN  

 Development Program. It is a member of all the specialised  

 agencies.  Australia is the eleventh largest contributor to  

 the UN budget and we are also a major contributor to the ^  

 budgets of the specialised agencies and the various funds  

 maintained throughout the UN system.

 40 years after the Charter came into force another Labor  

 government is in power in Australia.  We have reaffirmed

 commitment to the United Nations through our election to,  

 and active participation in, the Security Council and the  

 Commission for Human Rights. That reaffirmation is one of  

 basic principle. My party is committed to the international  

 humanist values that motivated many of those involved in the  

 establishment of the United Nations Organisation.

 Those over 40 often point to that age as marking the onset

 of middle age. For those approaching that age now, who in

 their youth were wont to say "never trust anyone over 30", 

 the very idea of becoming 40 is in itself almost enough to 

 induce a feeling of mid-life crisis. On the other hand, 

 there are many who give conviction to the defiant cry that 

 "life begins at 40".

 A fortieth birthday is a significant one for any ordinary

 mortal, and it is an appropriate point at which to review 

 the state of the United Nations, for which rather out of the 

 ordinary hopes were held.

 By far the most important reason f-or treating this 40th' 

 anniversary as significant is that the United Rations is 

 undergoing a period of-* reassessment and self-criticism " Î¯ "·:Ï ·

 grounds that their political influence has waned although 

 their financial contributions continue to increase and 

 remain the principal source of funding.

 Non-aligned countries point to the inability of the system 

 to resolve issues of key importance to them - in particular 

 the problems of Southern Africa and the Middle East, and the 

 creation of a new international economic order. Smaller 

 states see the UN system as having failed to preserve their 

 security, to prevent aggression and to promote development.

 It is in the areas of maintenance of international peace and 

 security - envisaged as the main function of the UN at its 

 creation - that the United Nations is most often accused of· 

 failure. Wars continue to occur with alarming regularity - 

 although the world has been spared another global conflict h.â V ‘  ' ·

 during the lifetime Of. the; :=UN. ? â  â  â 

 The UN was, after all, set up to rid succeeding generations 

 of the scourge of war. There are, unhappily, reasons why 

 the system .'envisaged by the founders did not work as its 

 founders had hoped. The cooperation among the great powers 

 during the war soon fell apart with the advent of the Cold 

 War and doctrines of security based on nuclear deterrence. 

 The world has turned out to be a more complex and less 

 secure place than could have been foreseen by its founders 

 at San Francisco.

 There has been criticism both when the UN has taken decisive 

 action for example the peacekeeping operation in the Congo 

 - as well as when it has been unable to act. All too often, 

 however, the UN has been regarded as little more than a 

 glorified debating chamber, a venue for countries harmlessly 

 to let off steam.

 Another common perception of the UN is that it is an 

 overblown bureaucracy, with too many overpaid people who do 

 little and achieve little. This perception is most common

 -5-

 in those countries, including our own, which pay the largest 

 part of the UN's bill. In many cases this is a distorted 

 view. Nevertheless the image of the UN has suffered with 

 such incidents as the decision to fund a multi-million 

 dollar conference centre in Addis Ababa at a time when world 

 attention focused squarely on the terrible famine in 

 Ethiopia.

 There is growing pressure to restrict the budgets of UN 

 bodies and to achieve better results. At the same time the 

 emergence of new humanitarian and developmental issues, such 

 as food, famine, debt, refugees and human rights has 

 increased the financial and organisational pressures on the 

 system. The UN agenda needs to be pruned to make way for 

 these issues so that adequate resources can be' devoted to\ 

 them. While there is stalemate over many issues, such 

 pruning will be ditficult,,.. to achieve, because one country's 

 ’side issue1  is all too of t<3m another's vital concern.

 There is substance to many of the criticisms of the United 

 Nations Qr^ganisation:

 . The UN is often stalemated by repetitive polemical 

 exchanges;

 . some of its operations are inefficient and costly;

 . it could play a more effective role in maintaining 

 peace and security;

 . its priorities do need to be reviewed and adjusted.

 When we, ask the question, "what is to be done?", there are 

 no easy solutions, no quick fixes. The UN is composed of a 

 multiplicity of sovereign nation states, often suspicious, 

 often jealous of their interests and prerogatives. Change 

 will only come with the realisation that what states have in 

 common is more important than that which divides them.

 -6-

 We should remember that the UN is to a large extent a mirror 

 of the world, an assembly of 159 nation states with their 

 differences, divisions and disputes.

 When international relations were dominated by the Cold War 

 so was the UN. During the 1960s and '70s, the conflict 

 between rich and poor nations - North vs. South - was 

 strongly reflected in the UN. Once again during the '80s 

 tensions between the superpowers have made East/West

 confrontation a dominant factor.

 The UN is an organisation of sovereign states unwilling to 

 sacrifice their national interests to the authority of an 

 international body. It has been made a scapegoat for the' 

 failings of nation-states. The argument is simple; ,  ,

 Social and Economic Development

 The most tangible and practical of those achievements have 

 been in the field of social and economic development. It 

 was one of Evatt's main concerns, as one who believed that 

 economic and social injustice was one of the root causes of 

 war, that the authority of the UN should be strengthened in 

 this regard. A survey of the UN and its specialised 

 agencies points to a wide range of successes, some dramatic, 

 some mundane but too frequently overlooked.

 For example, the World Health Organisation has been 

 instrumental in the almost complete eradication of 

 smallpox. The United Nations Children’s Fund has played ,  a1 

 vital role in providing clothing, food,  education and 

 medical assistance "to. millions of children and mothers in 

 developing countries.The united Nations Development Program 

 annually provides over half a billion dollars in practical 

 forms of assistance to the developing world. The World Food 

 Program plays a similarly important role.

 The office of the High Commissioner for Refugees has helped 

 to resettle millions of people made homeless by wars and 

 other disasters. In the aftermath of the India-Pakistan war 

 alone the UNHCR assisted in the resettlement of over six 

 million refugees. The Disaster Relief Organisation is 

 another agency which helps governments to prepare for and 

 deal with emergencies.

 The UN undertakes other important work in drug control, the 

 environment and population control.Specialised agencies such 

 as the Universal Postal Union and the International 

 Telecommunications Union, the International Civil Aviation 

 Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation 

 facilitate cooperation and the orderly management of the 

 world's communications and transport.

 -8-

 Since 1919, the International Labour Organisation has 

 negotiated conventions on working conditions and plays a 

 part in efforts to tackle the problems facing working 

 people. As a whole the specialised agencies play a 

 practical role that is overlooked because of the media's 

 preoccupation with the higher political profile of disputes 

 in the General Assembly and the Security Council. They are 

 the “quiet achievers" of the UN system, albeit many existed 

 before the UN itself was established.

 The much-maligned UNESCO has made important contributions 

 over the years. It has helped to overcome illiteracy in 

 many countries. It has helped to protect the world's 

 heritage - for example, to preserve threatened architectural 

 treasures such as the temples at Abu Simbal threatened by 

 the Aswan Dam and the Bofobodur complex in Java. '

 The Commonwealth Government has made it clear that Australia 

 does not intend to withdraw from UNESCO, and we do not share 

 the. senserof grievance which motivated the US to withdraw, 

 nor the general attitude to multi-lateralism exhibited by 

 some elements of the Reagan administration. There are 

 problems in any large organisation, but as Australia's 

 distinguished Ambassador to UNESCO pointed out in January 

 there has been no serious financial impropriety and the 

 accusations of mismanagement and anti-Western bias are 

 "colourful but imprecise".

 Apart from these programs, the UN also acts as an important 

 standard setter and mobiliser of world public opinion. It 

 establishes guidelines to deal with many of the critical 

 problems of our time, and sensitises governments and peoples 

 of their importance through conferences and programs.

 The UN Decade for Women, the International Youth Year and 

 International Year of Peace are examples. At a practical 

 level, we can also ask - would the rights and needs of the

 -9-

 world's disabled people have been recognised and translated 

 into widespread action if the International Year of the

 Disabled had not been promoted by the UN?

 This role of the UN as standard setter and forum for world 

 public opinion was one by which H.V. Evatt set great store. 

 "No country can be indifferent to world opinion", he said. 

 "The UN enshrines a code of behaviour for nations in regard 

 to each other".

 In the past 40 years more has been done by the United

 Nations in codifying international law than in all the 

 previous years of history. The development of a

 comprehensive Convention on the Law of the Sea is one 

 example of the significant achievements of the UN in

 formulating international, law, although it remains a matter / 

 for regret that the"' UN's' single most influential member, the 

 United States, together With ‘  three other major Western 

 countries - France, FRG and the UK - have not yet found it 

 possible to accept and adhere to the principles of that 

 treaty.

 Human Rights

 The UN plays a crucial role in the formulation of 

 international human rights law. The 1948 Universal 

 Declaration of Human Rights and the two 1966 International 

 Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic,- 

 Social and Cultural Rights are of fundamental importance in 

 this regard. Conventions on stateless persons, the rights 

 of women, the prevention of torture and the elimination of 

 racial discrimination constitute further authoritative 

 definitions of human rights. There are more than 20 such 

 documents, for which the Secretary General of the UN 

 performs depositary functions, and many more in operation 

 under the auspices of UNESCO and the International Labor 

 Organisation.

 -10-

 This is an aspect of the work of the United Nations on which 

 I personally have always had a very strong interest. Cynics 

 may question the value of these international human rights 

 conventions. Do they in fact guarantee anything, or are 

 they observed mainly in the breach?

 I believe their value lies in:

 .  their expression of common standards and goals of

 achievement for all nations;

 .  their universal expression of the need to protect

 basic human rights, which serves to emphasise the

 fundamental nature of the rights and freedoms in. 

 question; .

 . their striking of a bond of co-operation between

 nations in seeking to solve international· economic, 

 social, cultural and humanitarian problems· and ;

 . in a specifically Australian context, the foundation  they provide for the legislative application on a 

 national basis of international rights standards.

 . " '* .

 These are contributions of real v a l u e . The instruments do  

 not just offer a 1 lowest common d e n o m i n a t o r 1 a p p r o a c h : they

 set standards which are high but not unrealistic;  

 achievable but not trivial.

 Labor governments have certainly never had any doubt about,  

 their w o r t h . The Whitlam Government legislated to implement  

 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial  

 Discrimination with the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975;  

 and the Hawke Government implemented the Convention on the  

 Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women  

 with last year's Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The W hitlam

 Government signed the Covenants on Civil and Political, and  

 E c o n o m i c , Social and Cultural Rights - which, together with  

 the 1948 C h a r t e r , consitute what might be called the  

 International Bill of Rights - immediately on coming into  

 office in December 1972. The Hawke Government (in what

 -11-

 proved to be almost my last act as Attorney-General) 

 withdrew on Human Rights Day, 1984, 10 December, ten of the 

 thirteen reservations and declarations with which the Fraser 

 government had unacceptably qualified its ratification of 

 the Civil and Political Rights Covenant,in 1980, and we are 

 now preparing to convert that Covenant into a legislative 

 Bill of Rights for Australia.

 The Hawke Government has also announced that we are giving 

 close and sympathetic consideration to acceding to the 

 Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 

 Political Rights, and making declarations under both Article 

 41 of that instrument and Article 14 of the Racial 

 Discrimination Convention, which in each case would open up 

 Australia to international scrutiny, of our human rights , 

 performance in individual cases. .  <

 K 

 For over a decade there has- been a lively ongoing discussion 

 in Australia about whether we need an overriding national 

 legislative Bill of Rights in this country - based on the 

 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - to 

 safeguard basic internationally recognised rights in our 

 legal system. The argument has many dimensions - and I have 

 been personally involved in nearly all of them over the 

 years - but there is one aspect of it that I would like to 

 say something about today. This is the argument - which has 

 been stalwartly pursued over the years by Stanley Johnston 

 among others, most recently in his evidence before the 

 Senate Committee examining the Bill of Rights issue, - that 

 it is . ·  satisfactory to rely upon the UN instruments 

 themselves, and the international machinery established uder 

 them, to safeguard these rights in Australia, and that there 

 is no need for supplementary domestic legislation.

 While I have the greatest respect, as I have indicated, for 

 the international covenants and conventions and the 

 machinery established under them to which I believe 

 Australia ought to be a party, I don't believe there is any

 -12-

 justification for the view that domestic legislation is 

 either unnecessary or undesirable.

 First, under Australian law, international conventions are 

 not self-executing. While Australia accepts obligations 

 when it ratifies an instrument, these are not part of 

 Australian law without specific authorising legislation.

 Secondly, most of the Human rights treaties actually require 

 the enactment of domestic legislation: for example, Article 

 2 of the ICCPR requires each state party to provide 

 effective remedies for violations of rights. Of necessity, 

 international instruments are often drafted in very general 

 terms. Domestic legislation can make clear what' rights and'  

 duties are involved and fit them more perfectly to the 

 domestic environment. ,  :  â 

 -v /' "â 

 Several conventions provide' fo.r a right of individuals to

 take complaints to an international body but this right is  

 provided subject to the exhaustion of local remedies. The  

 o b s e r v a n c e  of domestic remedies is thus an integral part of  

 the UN approach to the protection of human rights. Domestic  

 legislation can provide for remedies not available under the  

 UN conventions. In this respect it is worth noting that  

 although the European Convention on Human Rights provides  

 for ultimate access to a court with powers to direct payment  

 of compensation, the UN conventions on human rights do not.

 The drafters of the Australian Constitution provided  

 protect,ibn for private property, inter-state trade, trial by  

 jury, disestablishment and freedom of religion, and  

 prohibition of discrimination between States or citizens of  

 States. However, they rejected the US example of a Bill of  

 Rights, largely out of respect for the traditional common  

 law and conventional safeguards under the Parliamentary  

 system.

 -13-

 The model to which our Founding Fathers deferred was, of 

 course, the United Kingdom. It is, therefore, noteworthy 

 that the United Kingdom is now a party to the European 

 Convention on Human Rights. Despite the traditional 

 safeguards, the European Convention has been relied upon in 

 at least three major cases, involving treatment of prisoners 

 in Northern Ireland, corporal punishment in British schools, 

 and discrimination against foreign husbands of British 

 women. Furthermore, in 1978 the House of Lords passed by a 

 two-thirds majority a motion calling for a UK Bill of Rights 

 to provide further safeguards.

 The bottom line in the argument is simply this;, while the

 UN conventions are admirable expressions of an ideal,  and do

 have a weight, force and momentum of their own, individual ,

 nations like Australia have to enact their own laws and  '  . · ·  ' *  - · 

 enforcement machinery if 'those ideals are to be fully

 secured.

 The, Commission for Human Rights, as well as the General 

 Assembly, monitors the observance of human rights in many

 countries, and add to the pressures upon governments to 

 abide by the standards which they have endorsed. For 30 

 years the UN has made clear its condemnation of the system 

 of apartheid and maintained constant pressure for peaceful 

 change and advancement of human rights in South Africa.

 Another aspect of UN activity which Australia has 

 consistently sought to advance is the objective of self 

 determination and independence for colonial territories and 

 peoples.

 Decolonisation is one of the successes of the United

 Nations, which has laid the framework for the independence

 for hundreds of millions of people since 1945. In

 cooperation with the UN, Australia has brought its three 

 dependent territories to self-determination - Nauru in 1968,

 -14-

 Papua New Guinea in 1975, and most recently, the Cocos 

 Islands in 1984.

 Peace and Conflict Resolution

 Even in relation to peace and conflict resolution, the most 

 difficult aspect of its work, the UN has had some notable 

 achievements. The Security Council has laid down the

 framework for the settlement of a number of conflicts. 

 Peacekeeping operations have helped to control, if not to

 eliminate, violence in the Middle East, Cyprus, the Congo

 and Kashmir. The Secretary-General has played a mediating 

 role which facilitates essential communication between

 conflicting parties. The present Secretary-General has been  .  '  * ·  1 

 engaged in efforts to find solutions in Cyprus, the 

 Iran/Iraq war, Afghanistan and Cambodia. He has,1  made some i*'- . ‘ ; "Î .

 often challenged and criticised the multilateral system. It 

 has also acted robustly to defend its own interests within 

 that system.

 As the UN Secretary-General said in 1984, there has been 

 growing pressure for a retreat from internationalism and 

 multilateral cooperation at a time when developments in 

 relation to world peace and to the world economy demand 

 their strengthening.

 Recent years have witnessed heightened great-power tension 

 accentuated by a lack of progress in disarmament and arms 

 limitation. Violence has erupted or lingered in many parts 

 of the globe. There are continuing economic difficulties 

 for many countries and strains in the international trading' 

 system. Drought and famine threaten the African continent. /

 There is little evidence 'to -suggest that these pressing 

 problems can be solved on a bilateral or unilateral basis. 

 To tackle these tasks, a multilateral approach is 

 essentials ' ·  For that the world needs a United Nations 

 reformed and renewed - a body that preserves existing 

 strengths and transcends existing weaknesses.

 To achieve this requires not only effort by governments. 

 Public opinion, led by United Nations Associations around 

 the world, needs to maintain pressure for a better UN. I 

 congratulate all those members of the Australian UN 

 Association who have worked so hard for so many years to 

 raise the community's consciousness of, and support for, UN 

 ideals, and translate that understanding and support into 

 support for an even more effective United Nations in the 

 future.

 Australia's Commitment I

 I would like to mention some ways in which the Australian 

 government is supporting efforts to strengthen the role of

 -16-

 the UN. Our efforts are directed at a practical level, 

 looking for more effective approaches to problems within the 

 traditional framework.

 Since Australia took up its seat on the Security Council, we 

 have sought to promote working methods that would help 

 towards the settlement of disputes. In particular, we have 

 given strong support to the Secretary-General and his 

 capacity to mediate disputes and conduct fact-finding 

 missions. We have called for a greater use of private 

 meetings of the Council which reduce the likelihood of 

 unproductive point scoring and polemical exchange.

 Australia has adopted a similar position in relation to the 

 General Assembly. Along with other nations, we are looking' 

 for ways to review the agenda, to get away from; pointless , 

 resolutions, which'* are'^repeated each year, and whose ·

 non-implementation only further; undermines the authority of  the world body.

 We are .^eeJcing to promote administrative reform and to 

 restrain the growth of UN budgets in a way that will make 

 the organisation and the specialised agencies cost-effective 

 and able to deliver their programs more efficiently.

 These are small steps, but they are steps in the right 

 direction and we think that more and more countries will 

 follow suit as the recognition grows that a more effective 

 United Nations is in the interests of all.

 In 1945, H.V. Evatt, responding to early critics of the 

 emerging UN, argued that they should turn their efforts to 

 work as hard as possible to make the existing organisation 

 successful.

 "On the success of the United Nations Organisation", said 

 Evatt, "will depend the political shape of the world for a 

 generation at least and, very possibly, the future of modern

 -17-

 civilisation" .

 That judgment still has a very substantial degree of 

 validity in 1985.
