 Media Release 

 Preston’s Successful Settlement Program

 18 May 2005

 The Australian Government is continuing to help thousands of migrants and refugees successfully settle in Preston every  year. 

 The Federal Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, today met with Victoria’s Northern  Migrant Resource Centre’s Chairman Gaetano Greco, staff and board members.

 ‘More than 14 000 migrants have settled in Preston over the past five years from countries such as the China and India. Of  these, almost 2500 people were granted visas on humanitarian grounds from countries including the former Yugoslavia,  Iraq and Sudan,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘For more than 24 years, the Migrant Resource Centre has been a vital link between the incoming settlers and their new  community by providing assistance in a variety of areas including housing and employment. 

 ‘Last year, through its Job Network services, the Northern Migrant Resource Centre helped more than 600 migrants and  refugees find full time employment.

 ‘From this support, the new arrivals develop a sense of belonging and are able to contribute to their community socially  and economically.

 ‘Today’s meeting shows that the Australia Government is listening to the concerns of the settlement agencies and the  diverse communities they assist,’ Minister McGauran said.

 Last year, the Northern Migrant Resource Centre received more than $4 million in core funding and grants from the  Australian Government to further improve its settlement services and the Job Network program.

 ‘The Australian Government is always looking for better ways to help new arrivals settle into their new community,’  Minister McGauran said.
