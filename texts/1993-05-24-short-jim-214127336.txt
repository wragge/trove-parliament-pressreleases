 "The Politics o f Immigration!1

 Address

 by

 Senator Jim Short  Shadow Minister for  Multicultural Australia,  Immigration and Citizenship

 Brisbane  24 May 1993

 Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today at this important  conference.

 May I at the outset congratulate the Bureau of Immigration Research on its  initiative in organising the conference, and on the galaxy of academic and  other talent you have managed to congregate here. Could I also  congratulate James Jupp and Marie Kabala on their co-editorship of the 

 Politics o f Australian Immigration, and the individual contributors for their  important contributions.

 I had the good fortune to receive an advance copy a few days ago. Whilst  I would not pretend to have read it all, I have read several of the chapters,  and with great interest. There is no doubt it is an important addition to the  literature and debate on Australian immigration. It should be required  reading not just for academics, bureaucrats, politicians and ethnic groups 

 and lobbyists, but for a much wider audience. Because the contributions  cover collectively a subject of great economic, social, humanitarian and  political significance for us all.

 I want today to address briefly some of the elements of the immigration  debate from the perspective of the Liberal Party in the 1990's.

 In doing so I will be more circumspect than perhaps some of you would  wish. But having had this Shadow Portfolio for only six weeks, and  conscious of both its diversity and its sensitivity, I propose to walk before I  run in this, my first formal speech in my new role.

 The running will come after I have concluded the wide range of  consultations with interested persons and organisations that I will be  conducting throughout Australia over the next two months.

 I will then commence the process of review of our existing policies on  immigration, multiculturalism and citizenship, in association with my Party  colleagues within both the Parliamentary and organisational wings. I

 I cannot of course prejudge the outcome of this review in any detail. But  what I am confident of is that our policy will continue to be underpinned by  the following essential principles, conscious in the knowledge that  throughout its whole existence the Liberal Party has been in the vanguard 

 of encouraging, developing and implementing positive and progressive  immigration policies in the light of Australia's economic and social  circumstances, and that Australia is one of the great immigrant nations qf

 BIR Conference 1

 the modem world.

 1. The principle that immigration has been quite fundamental to  Australia's national economic and social development, and to our  international standing, throughout our history, particularly in our post  World War II history - and that it will continue to play a significant  role in the future.

 2. That our approach to immigration policy must have as its essential and  unequivocal priority putting Australia's national interests first, whilst  at the same time paying due regard to our international 

 responsibilities.

 As the Fitzgerald Report put it, our "immigration policies (should) be  developed in the national interest and for all Australians."

 3. In this latter regard - and particularly in today's volatile and often  violent world - a refugee/humanitarian content must be a distinct  component of the overall immigration program, recognising that its  humanitarian motivation contrasts it with the other parts of the  program, which are in the main motivated by economic and social 

 considerations.

 4. Immigration policy must be non-discriminatory as regards to race,  nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin, gender or religion.

 5. All Australians, whatever their origin, should have on overriding  commitment to Australia No. 1, but within that context should also  have the right to express their individual cultural heritage and  backgrounds. In other words, all Australians are part of a truly  multicultural nation, bound together by the uniting and special bond 

 of being Australian, and respecting the institutions and principles  which are basic to Australian society.

 6. And finally, the principle that to be a citizen of Australia is a unique  prize, that all Australian residents should be encouraged to become  citizens, and that the significance of citizenship, with both its great  privileges and responsibilities, should be accorded a higher priority 

 than it is often the case now.

 Against the background of these basic principles, let me now look at some of the more important issues facing us in this area today.

 BIR Conference 2

 In doing so I want to stress how important I believe it is to have broad  community acceptance of where Australia is going on both the immigration  and multiculturalism fronts - 1 say fronts rather than front because the two  are quite different in many ways.

 It is because we have had broad community acceptance of both the  objectives and the implementation of Australia's migration program under  successive governments for almost half a century that the program has been  such a great success, and has been an important factor in making our society  one of the most tolerant, fair, free, peaceful, stable, and cohesive - despite  its diversity - in the world.

 In recent years there have been some signs that community attitudes  towards migration may be shifting somewhat. There is more questioning of  "why immigration" than we have been previously - and more questioning of  its composition.

 Policy makers cannot afford to ignore this in their approach to migration.  To do so would be to risk injecting a totally unwelcome and unacceptable  element of divisiveness into our community, and put the longer term  objective at risk.

 This means that, in having as a fundamental long term objective the  continuation of a significant migration program, we need to have regard to  the current economic environment in determining the specific details of our  policy from one period to another.

 I think we also need to pay more regard than we have in recent decades to  the relationship between our migration policy and our general approach to  population policy. We need to have a broad view - but not rigid in terms  of specific numbers - on the size of Australian population we think desirable.

 That in turn requires us to look particularly at our family policies, and other  factors affecting our rate of population increase. Young families in  Australia have been very hard done by in recent years through economic  circumstances. There can be little doubt this has had some impact on the 

 birth rate.

 We need to do much more to assist families than we do. The best thing we  can do of course is to pursue economic policies that provide jobs and raise  real incomes - quite the opposite of what has occurred through much of the  past decade.

 BIR Conference 3

 I won't pursue this further today other than to say that migration policy  cannot logically be considered in isolation of economic policies, family  policies and a range of social policies.

 Implications o f  Structural Change

 Employment-related migration, immediate family reunion, and  refugee/humanitarian requirements are all essential elements of our overall  immigration program and I would expect will remain so.

 Within this, however, the structural changes within the Australian economy -  and the economies of other countries too - have had a profound influence  on our labour market and the employment opportunities it provides.

 The dramatic shrinking in relative terms of the manufacturing sector - and  the even more dramatic reduction in unskilled and semi skilled factory jobs -  and the accompanying growth of a wide range of so-called service industries,  have changed forever the appropriate employment related selection criteria 

 of the 1940's, 50's and 60's. We will obviously require further changes to the  criteria in the future.

 There are problems with the existing criteria.

 Notably, there is no link between applicants' particular skills and  qualifications and the availability or otherwise of those skills and  qualifications in Australia. As a result, applicants can be accepted for entry  into Australia without any foreseeable prospect of finding employment in  their field of training.

 This is ridiculous. It is cruel for Government to raise the employment hopes  of aspiring migrants only to have them dashed when they arrive to find  unemployment so rife, and the dole after six months the only "opportunity"  Australia can offer.

 Such a situation is not only degrading and debilitating to the newcomer. It  also leads to undesirable tensions within the Australian community as tax  payers come to resent the cost that immigration has in such an identifiable  and direct sense. Migrants who arrived in Australian within the last two 

 years are currently receiving around $400 million per annum in social  security benefits.

 BLR Conference 4

 Consideration should be given to applying a penalty where the applicant's  qualifications are in an area already oversupplied in Australia.

 The Government bit the bullet last year with respect to Medical Practioners  when it gave such applicants a 10 points penalty. It should consider a similar  approach to other skilled categories where there is already an oversupply of  Australians seeking work. Dr Bob Birrell has identified engineers, computer 

 professionals, tradespersons and teachers as categories where such a policy  could be applied.

 The structural changes within the Australian economy are not the only  structural influences on our approach to migration. The opening up of the  Australian economy has had a major impact on the attitudes of business.

 Business people today are looking increasingly at overseas markets for their  longer term growth prospects. This trend, will accelerate. Whilst business  is likely to maintain its traditional positive approach to immigration, the  motivation may be less strong, and have different bases, than in the past.

 I don't think the bottom line approach of the business community will differ  from that of the great majority of the Australian community, namely that the  criteria for selection should be targeted towards those who it is believed will  most benefit Australia. ’

 Let me say that in my view getting the selection criteria right is a much more  important task than attempting to get the actual numbers right. The Liberal  Party has always been opposed to setting too rigid and fixed targets for  intake numbers, although as I said earlier we need to have a broad view  about the appropriate level of intake from one period to another. But it is  the quality of the intake, and its relevance to Australia's needs, that is the 

 essential determinant “of the correctness, or success, of our immigration  program.

 Administration o f  th e M igration Program

 Good planning, efficient administration, and the public perception of strict  non-discrimination are also essential for a successful migration policy and  program.

 Unfortunately there have been recent indications that all is not as it should  be within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

 BIR Conference 5

 There have been claims made of institutional bias within the Department  towards refugees, including the boat people detainees.

 There have been movements of senior personnel that have not been  adequately explained.

 The Australian Federal Police have been called in by the Secretary of the  Department to investigate a particular situation.

 A senior officer has been stood down from his duties, which has prompted  a meeting of officers of the Department convened by the PSU to move a  vote of no-confidence in the Secretary.

 Concern has been expressed from a number of quarters - including me - at  the unacceptable situation where several hundred boat people have been  held in detention camps on Australian soil for periods of more than three  years without resolution - one way or the other - of their situation.

 Figures revealed to a Senate Estimates Committee just last week, put the  cost of maintaining in detention camps boat people seeking refugee status  at more than $21 million. The costs vary enormously from one camp to  another. In Port Hedland the cost is $38 a day. In other centres it is up to  $200. In addition the cost of providing legal assistance to boat people 

 asylum seekers in the last two years alone has been almost $1.5 million, and  that excludes the costs involved in litigation.

 The Refugee Review Tribunal is due to commence operations on 1 July  1993, although so far only the Principal Member, one other Member and the  Registrar have been appointed, and key support staff are yet to be selected.

 So severe have the pressures on the review process been that the Senate  Estimates Committee was advised last week that the RRT will be faced with  an estimated backlog of 6000 cases when it opens its doors in five weeks  time.

 Another area of imminent pressure for the Department and the  Government concerns Chinese students in Australia. 17,000 Chinese  students were already in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square  massacre on 4 June 1990 and were therefore eligible for the 4 year "special 

 category of temporary resident permit" granted by then Prime Minister  Hawke. I understand another 9,000 spouses and dependent children of the  students are also covered by the special permit.

 BIR Conference 6

 The permits expire on 30 June 1994, and at this stage I understand the  Department is doing no pre-processing of these people in advance of June  1994. Nor has the Government announced whether it will honour  Mr Hawke's commitment that no Chinese students in Australia at the time  of Tiananmen Square would be forced to return home against their will.

 In addition to these 26,000 pre-Tiananmen Square Chinese students and  their dependents, I understand there are a further 24,000 Chinese students  who have arrived in Australia since Tiananmen Square and who have  applied for refugee status. So far the Department has made a primary 

 decision on only around 8,000 of these, and of these 5,500 are under appeal.  The remaining 16,000 are still to be initially processed.

 The handling of these numbers will put great strain on the Department, the  RRT and the judicial system. It would be intolerable to have the same  delays occur in these cases as has happened with the boat people detainees.

 The Coalition has always maintained that applications for permanent  resident status should be determined on merit. This means, necessarily, case  by case examination. This important principle should apply without  exception.

 It has special significance, of course, in the processing of Chinese students  and their dependents. The Parliamentary Committee on Migrant  Regulations last year recommended that the pre-Tiananmen Square students  be required to have their situations determined on a case-by-case basis, as  has always been the situation for the post-Tiananmen Square students.

 The Government has yet to respond to the Parliamentary Committee's.  report. It is important that it do so urgently, because of the implications not  only for the students themselves, but for the Department.. ~

 For all the reasons I have outlined in my remarks today, I believe there  should be a thorough inquiry into the Department of Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs. That inquiry should investigate the matters of concern that  have been raised about its operations, and the implementation of the  migration program. It should also, however, examine the Department's 

 capacity to handle in the future the tasks for which it is responsible.

 BIR Conference 7

 Citizenship

 Before concluding, may I say a few words about citizenship.

 The Coalition, for a considerable time now, has called for a new priority to  be given to the relevance and significance - the value - of Australian  citizenship.

 For people who have chosen Australia as their home - as distinct from being  born here - the act of taking out citizenship is - or should be - the pinnacle  expression of commitment to Australia, its laws and institutions and values.

 It should really mean a great deal to achieve citizenship. It should be a goal  people strive for, that they earn.

 It should, also be an attainment which has its rewards, as well as its  responsibilities. I am not confident that it is always seen in this light  nowadays.

 Time prevents me going into this in more detail today. It is an important  subject to which I hope we will all give more thought.

 I would say, however, that it is clear that we need a major overhaul of the  1948 Citizenship Act. That Act has scarcely been amended since its  introduction. It is essentially a mechanistic Act - the detail of how one  becomes a citizen. It contains nothing about what it really means to be an 

 Australian citizen. It contains no clear statement of the benefits of  citizenship, or of the responsibilities. It contains no enunciation of any  meaningful qualifications for citizenship.

 The Government recently introduced, a proposed amendment to the  Citizenship Act to abolish the Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance, and to  replace it with a so-called Pledge. Unfortunately, however, no changes of  the kind I have been talking about were proposed.

 The Coalition, whilst opposing the premature abolition of the Oath or  Affirmation at this time in the evolving debate on Australia's constitutional  arrangements, has obtained the agreement of the Senate to have the  amending Bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and 

 Constitutional Affairs for examination and report back to the Senate at the  commencement of the Budget Session of Parliament.

 BIR Conference 8

 I hope the Committee might be able to make at least a start at considering  some of the wider fundamental issues of citizenship.

 Conclusion

 I have attempted today to give you a brief outline of how I and the  Coalition see some of the major issues both of principle and of detail  surrounding Australia's migration policy and its implementation in the 1990's.

 Although the shape and focus of our migration policy will change and evolve  in the future, just as it has in the past, it will remain an integral component  of our economic, social, and political development as a nation.

 As I said at the onset, the Liberal/National Party Coalition has always been  in the vanguard in the development and administration of beneficial,  humane ,and compassionate migration programs committed to the  furtherance of Australia's national interests and the meeting of our  responsibilities and obligations to all Australians. I can assure you we will  continue in the vanguard in the future.
