 ADDRESS BY RT HON.  IAN SINCLAIR, SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, TO CONFERENCE ON 'ASIAN PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNATIONAL SECURITY',  MONDAY, 11TH APRIL, 1983 J

 In international relations certain areas of the world are of 

 key importance - geographically, strategically and economically.

 Any change in their position has a wide ranging effect on the 

 global balance of power.

 Immediately apparent is the Middle East with its role as the 

 prime supplier of oil to the world. Yet the United States with 

 its peace keeping responsibilities is dependent on the Persian 

 Gulf for only 8% of its oil needs, while the'Japanese are 

 75% dependent on the Gulf and some European nations only 

 slightly less so. .

 Other regions have importance thrust upon them because they 

 become testing grounds for trials of strength between external 

 forces that intrude into them such as was the case in Vietnam 

 in the 60s and Cambodia and Laos today.

 Some areas in Asia without doubt fit into each of these alternatives.

 However, it is well to remember that the question how important 

 an area is in the general pattern of international strategic 

 concerns is different to how important that area may be for any 

 particular country close to it.

 PERSPECTIVES

 Within Asia, population size and the reality of human survival 

 themselves generates political pressures.

 More than one fifth of the world's population live in the 

 adjoining land masses of China, India and Pakistan. All suffer 

 periodically from flood and famine.

 Internal transportation is generally inadequate, always over­

 crowded and unreliable. Standards of health and hygiene by 

 western standards are poor. Mere survival is of constant 

 concern. _

 The level of literacy generally is minimal, while poverty exists 

 side by side with the rigidities of a traditional social structure 

 where the gulfs between the haves and have nots within communities 

 are greater than those between the nations of the so called 

 north and south themselves.

 Population, is unevenly spread. Significant·areas of Asia are 

 only only lightly populated while Java in Indonesia, Luzon in 

 the Philippines, Tonkin in Vietnam, Calcutta in India and Shanghai 

 in China suffer a population density such that it is a source of 

 weakness not strength.

 Inadequacies of land transport systems are minimal compared to 

 those of archipelagic States like the Philippines and Indonesia. 

 There isolation from the central Government and perceived lower 

 economic standards lend strength to political insurgencies.often 

 externally supported and promoted.

 There are of course many areas of instability and fragility,  

 in that enormous land mass which is Asia. In many violence is  

 e n d e m i c .

 It is in the attitude to the sufferings of others that we as 

 Australians often find ourselves unable to comprehend the 

 attitudes of Asians based as it is on the reality of constant 

 suffering and the survival of the fittest.

 Through history the martial arts were recognised in Asia as the 

 epitomy of .man1s personal achievement. From the Doctrines of 

 SunWu,  the great Chinese master of military tactics, to those 

 of the Samurai of Japan soldiering has been the highese tradition 

 of the national elite.

 Ambassador Hugh Dunn's translation of the poem "White Horses" 

 written about 214AD by the princely Chinese poet Ts'ao Chih 

 aptly portrays an acceptance few Australians can comprehend.

 White horses with gold-studded trappings, 

 Ever-moving, are speeding north-west.

 "Tell me, whose sons are their riders?"

 "Sons of the knights of Yu and Ping 

 Who as youths have left their homelands 

 To win a name at the sandy desert's edge."

 Well-skilled they are at bending their strong bows;  

 How many kinds they have of thornwood arrows 2  

 Drawing their bowstrings, they pierce targets they 

 have passed;

 Loosing bolts ahead they scatter the Yueh Chih. 

 Raising their hands they take geese on the wing; 

 Crouching low they lengthen their.horses'  stride. 

 More cunning and nimbler than Monkeys. '

 Swift and bold as panthers or dragons!

 In the frontier cities there are many alarms 

 For the nomad raiders are often on the move.

 When the feathered summons comes from the north 

 Their hard-spurred horses climb the lofty ranges.

 'They pursue and trample the Hsiung Nu,

 They seek and override the Hsien Pi.

 They may die on a sharp weapon-point,

 But when alive,  what regrets have they?

 They give no thought to their parents

 And how can they speak of sons and women-foik?

 Their names are written on the roll of doughty knights,  

 They cannot brood on any private wish.

 Offering their bodies they answer their countryr  s need; 

 _Seeing death,  they hasten to it as if to home."

 4 .

 Attitudes to death aside, it is with the .

 prospects of the future with which we are concerned. Let me 

 then address three particular Asian regions :  South East 

 Asia, Indo China and Japan.

 SOUTH EAST ASIA .

 South East Asia's geography gives it particular importance for

 Australia.

 It is the only route by which a land based attack could occur 

 against Australia.

 A hostile South East Asia could interfere seriously,  if not 

 disastrously,  with vitally important Australian shipping and 

 air communications.  This would prejudice the international trade

 on which our economy depends.

 A hostile South East Asia with the support of the Afro-Asian 

 world could subject Australia to a variety of indirect pressures 

 which if not a threat to our territorial integrity could still 

 be damaging to our national interests.

 In this respect it needs to be remembered that Australia's 

 international position abounds in anomalies and disparities.

 Australia is a European country i nan Asian environment. It is 

 an agricultural and natural resource exporting country with a 

 continuing requirement for capital and overseas knowhow,  just as 

 the developing world. '

 It is an underpopulated country,  where over the next 20 years 

 the number of people aged 65 or over will grow by two-thirds 

 and their proportion to the total Australian population will 

 increase from about 10% to more than 12%.

 These demographic statistics contrast with those of our over­

 populated Asian neighbours who generally enjoy an average age 10 

 years below ours.

 Australians live in a wealthy country on a per capita basis 

 among generally poor countries.

 Our economic growth rate, the subject of this week's national 

 economic summit has been seri-ously affected by the most severe 

 drought since white settlement,  and by international conditions 

 affecting the marketing of our major mineral exports.

 6 , â 

 With wages above productivity and high interest rates, Australia's

 manufacturing industry has contracted and unemployment has risen

 dramatically. As a result.our balance of payments is increasingly 

 dependent upon capital inflow.

 In contrast the economies of Australia's Asian neighbours have 

 been growing at a faster rate than those of other developing 

 nations and certainly at a faster rate than our economy can 

 accommodate if present percentages of trade are to be maintained.

 The result is that ASEAN nations are increasingly turning to 

 other markets. If this continues,  Australia's economic 

 significance to the region will decline. If this is reflected in 

 strong strategic allegiances with others to our detriment, the 

 result could affect Australia's security environment.

 Since its establishment in August 1967 ,  ASEAN has developed in 

 international stature as a result of its members consistently 

 pursuing a common approach to strategic matters. This augers 

 well for the stability of our region.

 Yet each of its members individually suffers problems of 

 internal social and economic development, most with a core of 

 militant dissidents working and sometimes fighting against the 

 central Government and enjoying some support from regional, 

 communist Governments.

 While none today threaten the stability of any of these countries, 

 their containment has been the key to most forward military 

 planning. Importantly, they have contributed to enhancing the 

 stature of the Army and its senior officers in each ASEAN 

 nation and led to the military involvement in three of their 

 Governments.

 Australia's Defence Co-operation Program has been directed not 

 towards insurgencies but to the generation of an ability to 

 resist external aggression. This emphasis has received their 

 increasing support with a common recognition of the threat 

 against the territorial integrity of one of their number ,  the 

 front-line State, Thailand.

 While ASEAN itself is not a military pact, several formal defence 

 arrangements exist within the region.

 The South East Asian Treaty Organisation died with the war in 

 Vietnam but the Manila Pact is still in the pigeon holes. It 

 is under its terms that United States Defense Secretary,

 Caspar Weinberger;, in the light of Vietnamese attacks last 

 week against refugee settlements on the Thai border,  announced 

 a major package of military aid to Thailand.

 Two members of ASEAN,  Malaysia and Singapore, are members of 

 the Five Power defence arrangement with Australia, the United 

 Kingdom and New Zealand.

 7 .

 T

 8 .

 It is under this arrangement that elements of the Australian and 

 New Zealand Defence Forces are stationed in Malaysia and Singapore. 

 It was in accordance with its terms that the Coalition Government 

 intimated that it would offer to base F/A— 18 aircraft at 

 Butterworth Air Base.

 Another major ASEAN national defence arrangement is the Mutual 

 Defence Treaty negotiated between the Philippines and the USA 

 in 1951.

 This month the United States/Philippines Bases Treaty which 

 exists alongside the head agreement comes up for its ritual 

 five year review. There is common acceptance that

 the Subic Bay Naval Base,  the Clark Air Force Base and two 

 smaller facilities are the most important United States 

 installations between Japan and the Indian Ocean.

 The $500 million US package of military and economic assistance 

 and the millions more pumped into the local economy by the 

 personnel attached to the bases are important economically to 

 the Philippines while the facilities themselves are important 

 not only to that nation but to the maintenance of the western 

 deterrence in the whole region.  ·

 In spite of past instability, South East Asia today is a collectioi 

 of established sovereign States, each with a strong sense of 

 national identity.

 Each is increasingly capable of its own defence and most seek 

 to strengthen their regional relations in ASEAN and with their 

 regional neighbours through a variety of economic,  social and 

 political relationships. -

 Certainly, the area is not the colonial vacuum through which 

 Japanese forces stormed so swiftly and so easily forty odd 

 years ago.  _  ·

 In some circles the perspective of a regional threat against 

 Australia is a euphemism for Indonesia. Its future disposition 

 haunts Australians in one form or another with its 155 million 

 population,  its size, its resources, its proximity and its 

 track record including Irian Jaya (West New Guinea), confrontation 

 and East Timor.

 The perspective I do not share. However, the future impact on 

 Indonesia - and Malaysia - of the as yet untested challenge 

 of the Islamic fundamentalist Right cannot be ignored.

 My perspectives and those of the Coalition Government differ,  

 however, at least from the platform of the Labor Party if not 

 from the new Government itself in attitudes to the Republic

 9 .

 r

 of Indonesia.

 10 .

 Fortunately, the visit of the Foreign Minister,  Mr. Hayden,  

 to Jakarta seems not to have inflamed our relationship. The 

 concessions his much vaunted diplomacy are reported to have 

 achieved are in general a re-statement of matters under 

 negotiation or agreed between the Coalition Government and 

 Indonesia.

 Whatever the detail, importantly the declared intention of 

 Prime Minister Hawke to visit Indonesia and the recognition 

 by the ALP Government of the necessity to develop relationships 

 with Indonesia are more positive than some of the comments by 

 Labor's left wing spokesmen:

 From my recent visit I believe President Suharto shows a 

 willingness to,increase bilateral co-operation. .

 In the defence field, the Defence Co-operation Program (DCP) 

 has enabled an excellent rapport to develop between senior 

 serving officers of both countries which bodes well for the 

 future.

 In reality > for Indonesia to change its policy to become a 

 significant threat to Australia would require a major diversion 

 of scarce resources from its well established domestic goals 

 and at a time when the OPEC oil price reduction has affected 

 its overseas earning s so adversely, this is economically 

 and strategically unrealistic.

 INDOCHINA

 The saddest country in Asia today without doubt is Cambodia.  

 Having suffered the appalling genocide of Pol Pot, the country 

 under Heng Samrin remains occupied by about a quarter of a 

 million Vietnamese forces.  Heng Samrin's regime were part 

 of that same murderous Khmer Rouge crew when hundreds of .  

 thousands of their fellow countrymen were killed in the late 

 1970's.

 Hanoi has made it clear it intends to pursue its occupation 

 of Cambodia and oppose the ASEAN proposal for a coalition 

 to rule the country under Prince Sihanouk.

 From Bangkok this week have come the sad reports from 

 the Thai-Cambodian Border of the biggest conflict since 

 Phnom Penh fell to the Vietnamese in 1979.

 While these border incursions have been directed at 

 Cambodian refugee settlements, Thailand of course is 

 apprehensive lest they be the forerunner of a more 

 significant attack.  ·

 The Vietnamese armed forces are ranked as the third 

 largest military force on earth with one of every three 

 of its adult males’of its 52 million people in some sort 

 of military force.

 12

 Their existence is predicated on the maintenance of 

 significant Soviet support and its use of the former 

 American facilities at Danang and Cam Ranh Bay.

 Since the Cambodian invasion, new military hardware such 

 as helicopters,  armoured vehicles and field communication 

 systems reportedly have been delivered to the Vietnamese.

 While.no doubt the Soviet has Vietnamese capabilities against 

 China in mind,  the bi-product is to enhance the Vietnamese 

 capability against Thailand. ·

 Operating Soviet made tanks and armour in the dry season 

 poses the Vietnamese forces a serious threat to Thailand 

 in their ability to cross the open plain country between 

 the Cambodian border and Bangkok.

 In Thailand recently there have been strains in the country's 

 political system with the rapid rise of General Arthit and 

 the uncertain health of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

 Should signs of political instability in Thailand develop, 

 the threat of Vietnamese forces moving into Thailand would 

 be increased. .

 \

 Any moves by the Hawke Labor Government to recognise Heng 

 Samrin or provide assistance to Vietnam before there is a 

 settlement in Cambodia and Hanoi withdraws its forces from there 

 and from Laos would alienate the countries of ASEAN and would 

 be against Australia's national interests.

 JAPAN

 13 .

 A third significant area of strategic interest in Asia is the 

 future defence role of Japan.

 Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,  himself a former Defence Minister 

 and the first post-war Japanese Prime Minister to have served in 

 World War 1I ,  has put defence into the forefront of his national 

 agenda.

 His statements on his first meeting with President Reagan while 

 welcomed by the Americans, were greeted by Japan's neighbours 

 from J'akarta to Kamchatka with everything from uneasiness to 

 outrage .

 There now seems a real prospect of Japan enhancing her self-defence 

 capability and playing a bigger role in the balance of power and 

 deterrence in her region.

 Prime Minister Nakasone when he declared Japan an "unsinkable 

 aircraft carrier" seemingly touched a raw nerve with the Soviet 

 Union whose most severe strategic restraint is the distance between 

 its industrial base in Europe and the large forces it maintains 

 in East Asia. â 

 Whether there will be a real role change in Japan's defence policy 

 remains to be determined.

 This year's Japanese Defence Budget shows an increase of 6.5%

 over last year, but this little more than keeps pace with the

 rate of inflation. However, it seems the 1% - of-GNP ceiling 

 on Japan's Defence spending is soon to be lifted.

 14.

 Certainly the Japanese Government has approved the recent port 

 call by the USS ENTERPRISE to Sasebo across the Sea of Japan 

 from Vladivostock ,  and the first nuclear powered carrier to 

 visit Japanese waters for some years. Further visits are planned.

 A plan to station two squadrons of USAF F/16 Fighter Bombers in 

 North Honshu to counter the Soviet build-up has also been announced

 Japan's Defence posture, in fact, began changing under former 

 Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, no doubt in part in response to 

 trade pressures by the Americans. However, these moves and 

 the decision by the Reagan Administration to maintain US Forces 

 in the Republic of Korea must be seen as a response to the 

 Soviet build up in the region and its increased use of Danang 

 and Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. .

 The strategic result of Japan's increased military consciousness 

 is a worthwhile additional deterrence against Soviet military 

 expansionism. However, the real concern of the South East Asian 

 leaders as to its character and future use must be recognised.

 CONCLUSION

 other

 There are, of course, many/areas of sensitivity in Asia 

 future of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea being three.

 the

 Equally important are the changed perspectives which the next 

 generation of political leaders in the region will bring.

 r

 15.

 In Australia, this is of immediate concern as the Labor left 

 so often is that party's voice in matters of defence and foreign 

 policy.  Indeed,  its views on ANZUS,  East Timor and a nuclear 

 free Pacific are sad examples.

 While in these early days of the new Government the result of 

 Mr. Hayden's visit to Jakarta and Port Moresby and his muted 

 condemnation of Vietnamese incursion into Thailand are better 

 than might have been anticipated ,  the shadow of Labor Caucus 

 remains. It hangs like Damocles' Sword over the Government's 

 head with all the uncertainty of Caucus attitudes lying in 

 the future. .
