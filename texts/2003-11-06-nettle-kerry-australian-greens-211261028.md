 Sen Kerry Nettle   

 

 

 Press Release 

 6.11.03 

 

 

 Sammaki decision should be replicated   

 

 

 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today welcomed the decision by the  Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone to grant a permanent resident visa to Mr  Sammaki.   

 "The Greens hope that this decision to grant a visa on humanitarian grounds to  Mr Sammaki is the sign of a change of heart by the Federal Government for  families incarcerated and separated by Australian's mandatory detention policy,"  said Senator Nettle.   

 "Hopefully this decision is recognition by the Immigration Minister that there is a  need to inject a humanitarian focus into our treatment of asylum seekers.   

 "The Greens congratulate the refugee support and community groups that have  been advocating for the Sammaki family.   

 "This decision stands in stark contrast to the cruel and senseless excision of  Melville and other islands from Australia's migration zone.   

 "The test for the Howard government and new Immigration Minister will be  whether this new found humanitarian sensibility is replicated for the families and  children that continue to suffer because of Australia's ongoing and inhuman  treatment of asylum seekers," said Senator Nettle.
