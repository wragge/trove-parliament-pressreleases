 AUSTRALIA ASSISTS DEMINING OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

 Australia will provide $200,000 to further assist with demining operations in Afghanistan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans announced today.

 This brings to $3.8 million the Australian assistance to Afghanistan and Afghan refugees in 1992/93.

 "Afghanistan faces the legacy of 14 years of war, including continuing instability, and 10 million anti personnel mines threatening the lives of ordinary people.

 "Clearance of mines is essential for a return to normal life for Afghan people in many parts of the country.

 "Australia provided $500,000 to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan in September for demining.

 "An Australian army team is in Afghanistan until mid July as part of the United Nations Mine Clearance Training Team. Their work is highly regarded and has had a significant impact in reducing the number of Afghan people killed and maimed by mines.

 "This further assistance will enable the continuation of this lifesaving work," Senator Evans said.
