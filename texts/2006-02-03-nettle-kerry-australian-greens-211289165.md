 Indonesian claims on West Papuan refugees not  credible: Greens  Senator Nettle, 3rd February 2006 

 The new Indonesian Ambassador's assurances about the safety of West Papuan  refugees if they are returned to Indonesia are not credible, Greens Senator Kerry  Nettle said today.    

 "The escalating repression of the independence movement and generalised  suppression of the people of West Papua is well documented," Senator Nettle said.    

 "Just last week the special adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General on the Prevention  of Genocide, Juan Mendez said West Papuans were at "risk of extinction"    

 "The latest US State Department report on Indoensia outlines the numerous human  rights violations suffered by the West Papuans at the hands of the Indonesian  military and militia.    

 "The government should not be fooled by Indonesian double speak from this new  Ambassador.    

 "The Australian government should not give in to Indonesian pressure," Senator  Nettle said.
