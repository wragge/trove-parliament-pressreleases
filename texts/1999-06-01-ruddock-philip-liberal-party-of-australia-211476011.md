 Mr Ruddock said that the new MRT Members join acting 
Principal Member Ms Susanne Tongue in implementing a new phase in the 
merits review of immigration decisions.

  

 ‘With the commencement of this Tribunal on 1 June 
1999, a more streamlined and transparent review process comes into being.

  

 “The Tribunal replaces two separate tiers of administrative 
review, which will lead to significant reductions in processing times 
and ensure visa applicants receive quick decisions on their cases.”

  

 Mr Graham Friedman and Mr Joseph Metledge have been 
appointed as Senior Members of the MRT from 1 June 1999 to 31 January 
2001.

  

 Ms Julie Bail has been appointed as a full4ime Member 
from 1 June 1999 to 31 January 2001.

  

 Ms Jennifer Ellis has been appointed as a fulltime 
Member from 15 June 1999 to 31 January 2001.

  

 Six part-time Members have been appointed from 1 June 
1999 to 31 January 2001. They are Ms Norma Ford, Ms Ellen Goodman, Ms 
Robin Hunt, Mr Steve Karas Ms Lilly Mojsin and Mr Paul Wakim.

  

 Mr Ruddock said while this is the first round of appointments 
to the MRT, he expects to make further rounds of appointments in June 
to bring the number of MRT members up to its full complement. One member 
will be based in Brisbane and at least one member will be appointed 
in Perth.

  

 “These appointments will bring a wealth of experience 
in administrative review to the MRT. Many have served with the Immigration 
Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal, and all have enjoyed 
distinguished professional careers in the Australian community”.

  

 In addition to the MRT appointments, Mr Peter Molony 
has been appointed as a part time Member of the RRT from 28 May 1999 
to 31 January 2001.

in merits review with another Commonwealth Tribunal.”
