  47 boat people intercepted 

  Customs Coastwatch has arranged interception of a vessel containing 47   suspected boat people off north-western Australia, the Minister for Justice and   Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today. 

  The vessel, a motorised lndionesian fishing vessel, was detected late yesterday   near Ashmore Islands by a Coastwatch Dash-8 aircraft. The Customs vessels   Roebuck Bay and Wauri were then tasked to intercept the vessel. 

  The   suspected boat people are mostly of Middle Eastern origin. A total of four   crew were also on the vessel. 

  The vessel, which had developed leaks and was in danger of sinking, was moved   quickly by Customs to an approved dumping site away from the reef, and   destroyed to prevent any damage occurring to the fragile Ashmore Island   environment. 

  Custorns is arranging for the boat people to be transported to the mainland where   they will be handed over to officials from the Department of Immigration and   Multicultural Affairs.
