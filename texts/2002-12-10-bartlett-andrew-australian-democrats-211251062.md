 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Immigration 

 10th December 2002   MEDIA RELEASE     02/ 598             

 

 

 Government’s version of events around   asylum seekers springs more leaks    

 There continue to be shameful revelations of how asylum seekers were treated in the second half of  2001, the Leader of the Australian Democrats and Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett,  said today.   

 “The report released today by Human Rights Watch into Australia’s asylum seeker policy, reveals the  other side to the story uncovered by the Senate Select Committee into a Certain Maritime Incident,”  Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The Committee tried to interview survivors and asylum seekers, but we could not guarantee these  people that their evidence would not influence decisions by DIMIA. When you are in that situation it  means that only half the story can ever be heard. The culture in the Defence forces prevents people  from revealing the truth about these sort of events, yet history has shown that the truth eventually leaks  out.   

 “It could be years before the Australian public know the whole truth of what happened to refugees in  the last three months of 2001.”   

 Senator Bartlett also pointed to the just released HREOC Report on the Government’s failings around  an asylum seeking child in detention who stopped eating.   “The Government’s blatant negligence to protect the needs of this child is clearly outlined in the  HREOC Report,” Senator Bartlett said.    

 Today the Senate will also vote on a motion calling for a Judicial Inquiry into SIEV-X, as the  Democrats called for as a result of the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident.    

 Senator Bartlett also condemned the highly publicised raid by the Department of Immigration and the  Federal Police on a refugee family in Launceston yesterday.    

 “At the same time this raid was taking place, I received confirmation that only 16 temporary protection  visas, out of 8,000 investigated, have been cancelled because of identity fraud. On these statistics, the  odds are that this Launceston family will be cleared of the allegations,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “History will judge the Government’s actions around the 2001 election harshly,” Senator Bartlett  concluded.
