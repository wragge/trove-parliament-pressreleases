 Subjects: Government’s Failure on Border Protection Subjects: Government’s Failure on Border Protection   

 ROXON: What we have seen this week are signs of a Minister under  pressure.  We have seen Minister Ruddock making some extraordinarily bad  judgements.  Just when the use of his Ministerial discretion is being questioned,  we are seeing that he made a rushed decision when a boat was detected at Port  Hedland.  He put people onto a ship and put the public to great expense by  sending them 1800 kilometres to Christmas Island, but he didn’t bother to get  advice first about the fact that these people will be entitled to full legal rights  and it would have been much cheaper and simpler and safer to send them to  the Port Hedland detention centre.

 JOURNALIST:  Nicola, others have described this as a monumental stuff-up.  How do you describe it?   

 ROXON:  I think they might be my words, actually.  Well, it is a  monumental stuff-up.  We know now that the Government rushed, that the  Minister made a bad judgement, that he didn’t get advice, and he is now putting  the Australian people to great expense for no particular purpose.   

 JOURNALIST: Some would argue that it is the principle of the thing, and  that the Government’s policy has indeed worked when this is the first boat that  has tried to land on Australian territory in several years.  And even though they  will be entitled to their legal rights, the principle of sending that message that  you are going to end up on Christmas lsland, sort of, has to be maintained.   

 ROXON: The Government’s principle has completely failed.  If the  Government’s border protection system was working, this boat would have been  detected much closer to Christmas Island, not at Port Hedland.  Labor believes  that a Coastguard system would have detected this boat much sooner.  We then  would not be in a position where you have people within one or two kilometres  of the mainland being sent 1800 kilometres back to Christmas Island.  So this is  nothing other than a Government failure.   

 JOURNALIST:  What are the ramifications in terms of their  processing, given that this has happened now?    

 ROXON:  Well, it seems that every lawyer in the country has a  different view on this.  From our advice, these people will be entitled to their full rights that

 Nicola Roxon MP   Shadow Minister for Population and Immigration  Shadow Minister for Women  they would have if they had have arrived on the mainland or by air.  The were in the migration  zone, apparently within the port of Port Hedland, so it seems to us to be the worst of both  worlds - they have moved people to the excised zone of Christmas Island and they are going to  have the slow processing that would have occurred if they had have arrived on the mainland.   

 JOURNALIST: Will they have lawyers sent out to them?  What will they need?  What sort  of information do you have?   

 ROXON:  We don’t have any advice.  I know that others have been commenting that,  by moving people to Christmas Island, that there are concerns about whether these people will  have access to lawyers.  We are actually also concerned about the conditions of the facilities  there.  We hear different reports about the standards of those facilities, and particularly  whether they have any proper place to put eight children and one infant that are on board.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think that they should be sent back to Port Hedland?   

 ROXON:  I think that a sensible Minister - making a rational decision and getting  advice before he hurried to put people on a boat - would have seen that it was a more sensible  thing at that time to take people to Port Hedland.  We don’t believe in moving people back and  forth now that they are on their way there.  We are not in Government, we can't make those  decisions, but clearly if he had taken his time and not just reacted under pressure, we would  have got that advice and put them in Port Hedland.   

 JOURNALIST: On an international scale, is this just more embarrassment for Australia?   

 ROXON:  I think that it shows that our border protection system is not working and it  also looks like we are not getting the balance right with compassion.   Australia should be able  to have a strong border protection system and a compassionate migration system.  But this  Government seems to be failing on all counts.   

 JOURNALIST: In the past this get-tough policy doesn’t seem to hurt them at the polls,  though.  I mean, will this situation be any different?  Will anyone care?  Will the greater  population care?   

 ROXON:    I think that the get-tough policy is not working if the Howard Government  is not detecting a boat until it is one or two kilometres from Port Hedland.  That is what they  have been telling the public that they have been doing.  It has failed in this instance.  Clearly  we think that spending a huge amount of money to make up for their bungle is not something  that the Australian public will be happy about.     

 JOURNALIST: But it was detected eventually, and the fact is that there have not been  many boats arriving since the Government really cracked down on boat people.

 ROXON:  Obviously it is good for the country, and it is good for the people who  might be at risk on the seas in these boats if there are fewer boats.  Labor doesn’t want to take  away from that - it is better for the whole country.  But this situation has occurred, and the  Government’s system is not working.   

 JOURNALIST: [inaudible] to get to people, do you think?  And do you have any idea how  much this might cost - there’s the trip to Christmas Island, the legal action, the whole bit?   

 ROXON:  We don’t know how much it will cost but we think it’s going to be a huge  amount of money.   Clearly it costs a lot more to put 50-plus people on a boat and send them  1800 kilometres to Christmas Island.  We are told that they are taking staff to Christmas Island,  that they have to send specific food provisions to Christmas Island.  This is all going to add up  to a big bill to the taxpayer.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you have any idea about what state the detention centre is in?  Is it  manned at the moment?     

 ROXON:  No, our information is that it isn’t.  And that is why staff are also being sent  to Christmas Island, but we have very sketchy information at the moment and we are asking  the Minister to provide us with that information.     

 JOURNALIST:  Are the facilities appropriate to house these people?  If the Minister had  decided to leave them in Port Hedland, can the detention centre cope with another 53 people?   

 ROXON:  The facility at Port Hedland has plenty of space, several hundred places.   So there wouldn’t have been an issue about being able to put these people in the Port Hedland  facility. 

 

 JOURNALIST Do you think that moving them back to Port Hedland should be an option that is  investigated?  It seems to me that if they are going to be afforded the correct rights that they  should be afforded, i.e. if they had arrived on the mainland - access to lawyers and that sort of 

 thing - it is going to cost a lot sending them to Christmas Island.   

 ROXON:  I think those questions should really be directed towards the Minister.  I  don’t think that people should be moved back and forth and back and forth.  Clearly our view is  that the Minster should have got proper advice before he rushed to make this decision, before  he committed the Australian public to expense that, it seems, will not deliver anything of benefit  to the community and will keep people at risk in facilities that perhaps are not adequately  staffed or provided for.  These are all issues that we are pursuing.
