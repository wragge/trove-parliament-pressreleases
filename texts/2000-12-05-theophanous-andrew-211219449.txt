  The Hon. DR ANDREW THEOPHANOUS, M.H.R. 

  FEDERAL MEMi3ER FOR CALWELL 

  GOVERNMENTABOLISHESSYEC:IAL 

  ASSlCSTANCEHUMANTTARIANCATEGORY:   PROT.ESTS BY INDEPENDENTS SUPPORTED EW L,,4BOR   -‘Thlz I Ioward Governtncnt has arbitrarily abolished all Special Assistance Categories   of the IT.tmanitat-ian artn of the 1tntnigration program”, Dr Andrew Theophat~ous 

  rcvcaled 10 the I louse today. 

  Mqjor chmges to Australia’s inmigration policy were made in regul;.ttions. effective 

  from 1 Novctnber 2000. These changes have a direct impact on Australia’s   intel-national hurnanitariatl obligatiwls, and yet rcccih cd sigtii ficatitly little press 01   fanfare. 

  Dr JJleophanous moved a Disallowance Motion. in an ,lttetnpt to block these changes.   and to ensure that there was Parliatmmlary discussion of this very itnporl:at~l issue.   The I>is;~llowance Motion was supported by Labor Shadow Minister, ‘t Ion Con   Sciacca. and Indcpwdent Mr Pekr Andrcn. kc ho both spoke during the debate. 

  “‘T’hz Special Assistance Category MXS a very importat- t entry point for pcoplc front a   variety or world trouble-spots. Since 

  1991. a total of 23.337 victims of pcrsccution 

  haw entered Australia under this category f?onl countt-ies like 13urnw S~ldan. St-i   1 ,atika and the l~omer Yugoslaki.” 

  **Thz Minister’s claim that the tcltal number of people interested in   q@yitlg frc)nl 

  these countries has been reduced is incorrect. In fhct. in only the first eight months of 

  the 1999-2000 program. 17,453 applied for refugee and hutnanitarian status f’rotn the   Fat-tner Yugoslavia alone. The Government has however, discouraged the t~~utnbcr of   applicants under the SAC program by increasingly tightening the criteria for access to   that progtatn. 

  “l’lii: Go~,~ernmetlt*s abolition of these categories will force these people to join the   altwdy over-crowded itntiwdiatc fmily reunion quertc - which is defined as only   husbatld, \vi l’e and dependant childrIzt1. The consequence of’ the abolition o E’ the S;\C   categories wit I itie~~itably lead to mot-e people ;Wmiptitig to enter Australia 17). 

  utlauthorised means, and therefore exacerbating Australia’s current problcnis \i ith   processing these asylum-seekers and increasin:, 7 the nut-nbcrs in n~at~dalory dtActitioti.” 

  After the defeat of the Disallowat~lce Motion. Dr Theophntmus said he w~~uld be   tilottitot-itlg the fate of pcoplc f’rotii these coutilrits to try to 

  ctisctrc‘ that they ucrc ii01 

  disc!-itiiinated against in fitturt‘ pt-ogranls.
