 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It is fantastic to be here down at Manly Beach for this declaration of a World Surfing Reserve. Manly,  Queenscliff and North Steyne are iconic beaches. They’ve been great places for me and they’ve been great  places for millions of Australians and I think it’s very appropriate that they are the third beaches anywhere  in the world to be declared World Surfing Reserves.    

 I also just want to say that over the last week, you’ve seen more evidence that this is a Coalition that is an  alternative government and more evidence that this is a government which is an alternative opposition. This  week, the Coalition has announced a series of commitments. First of all, there was the commitment to  properly index military pensions. There was the commitment to increase our refugee and humanitarian  intake for women at risk. Finally, there was my commitment to a commission of audit to ensure that we  really do get value for money out of the functions of government. Every dollar that government has, it has  from taxpayers and government owes it to taxpayers to ensure that not a single dollar is spent except in an  effective and efficient way.    

 QUESTION:    

 Major General John Cantwell in a column today in the Sydney Morning Herald says that Stephen Smith as  Defence Minister has no respect for the men and women in uniform. Does this call into question his fitness  to serve as Minister for Defence?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think that Minister Smith has a serious problem. It was pretty obvious a week ago that he didn’t want to  serve as Defence Minister and it seems increasingly obvious that the Defence Department, the Defence  personnel don’t want him as their Minister. I think that a government that has poor relations with the serving  men and women of the Defence Forces obviously has a problem with its Minister and I think the best thing  that Minister Smith could do if he wants to rebuild his relationship with the Defence community is issue an  apology to Commandant Kafer for what he said about Commandant Kafer about a year ago.

 QUESTION:    

 A Galaxy poll today shows that the LNP will win in Queensland but Campbell Newman would fail to win  Ashgrove. What should the LNP do if Campbell Newman fails to win his seat and they win the election?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the only way to change the government in Queensland is to vote LNP in every single seat and I don’t  believe there will be a change of government in Queensland unless Campbell Newman wins his seat and he  should win his seat despite the atrocious and very personnel campaign being waged against him by the  Labor Party. I don’t believe that Queenslanders are going to vote for someone who’s only prepared to  campaign as a first name and who is too embarrassed to put Labor Party identification on her campaign  literature.    

 QUESTION:    

 Bob Carr is in New Zealand now. Is it appropriate that he is representing Australia before he is officially  sworn in?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think it’s important that Australia is appropriately represented. I think that the interesting challenge  for the Prime Minister is going to be the comparison between herself and Bob Carr. As I said last weekend,  be careful how close you get to the New South Wales Right because the New South Wales Right know how  to execute premiers. They know how to execute prime ministers and I think the New South Wales Right  have put Bob Carr into the government because they don’t believe that Julia Gillard can last the distance.    

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible]    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, look, we’ll just have to wait and see. As I said, I think the New South Wales Right have put Bob Carr  into the government because they are deeply concerned as to whether Julia Gillard can go the distance.    

 QUESTION:     

 So do you think Bob Carr will be found a lower house seat to get the leadership before the next election?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, let’s just wait and see but the New South Wales Right want their man in the government and that’s  what they’ve done with Bob Carr.    

 QUESTION:    

 Roads Minister Duncan Gay has called for there to be a flood levy to rebuild New South Wales towns like  Wagga. The State Coalition and the Federal Coalition are at odds on this issue. Do you think we should be  open to a flood levy for the New South Wales rebuilding of floods?    

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Look, the Coalition thinks that the ordinary contingencies of government should be met out of the ordinary  funding of government and if we weren’t wasting more than $50 billion on an unnecessary government  telecommunications monopoly, there’d be a lot more money to go around for the ordinary business of  government, including flood reconstruction.    

 QUESTION:     

 So you disagree with Duncan Gay then?     

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I’m just saying that it’s important to properly fund flood reconstruction but an efficient, prudent, frugal  government doesn’t need new taxes to deal with what are the ordinary contingencies of government.    

 QUESTION:    

 But is it fair for the people of those towns to be caught in the, be the meat in the sandwich though? If there  isn’t the money to spend and there isn’t a levy? Aren’t they going to lose out?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Government should and must and in my judgement will spend the money and they should meet the cost out  of the ordinary revenue of government.    

 QUESTION:    

 What are your thoughts on the government’s claim that the mining tax will benefit small businesses?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think that if you want to help small business, the best thing you should do is drop the carbon tax  because the carbon tax is going to increase every small businesses’ power bill by ten per cent on day one and  it’s just going to go up and up and up and up. The other thing about the carbon tax is from 2014 it is going to  increase every small businesses’ transport bill and that cost is just going to go up and up and up and up.  Small business doesn’t need new taxes. They need a government that gets on with the job of governing  without the new taxes that are raining down on small business from the Rudd-Gillard government.    

 QUESTION:    

 On another issue, in Victoria the Williamstown Dockyards are going to close and there’s speculation those  jobs will move offshore. What do you have to say about that?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, this is a government which claims to have a Buy Australia policy and yet plainly the Buy Australia  policy is just words. It’s not a fact. Now, I certainly think that government has to get value for money but all  things being equal, they really should give preference to Australian suppliers and yet again, this is a  government which has turned out to be all talk and no action when it comes to giving what it says is its  preference for Australian suppliers.    

 Thank you.
