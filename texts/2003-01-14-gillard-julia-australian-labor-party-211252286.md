 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration   

 GOVERNMENT SHROUD OF SECRECY DESCENDS  ON ASYLUM SEEKERS AGAIN   

 Minister Ruddock was today basking in the glow of his success in returning 34 unlawful non-citizens from Christmas Island to Sri Lanka.   

 However, he has only done half his job.  If he wants the credit for returns, he needs to come  clean about arrivals also.  He had the opportunity at his media conference to explain to the  public the full details of an unfolding situation in Tasmania concerning two asylum seekers,  but he squibbed it.    

 The two asylum seekers are young men from the Congo and Burundi who stowed away on a  flag of convenience vessel, the ‘Dorine’, before it left South Africa on 24 December.  The  ship was bound for Bell Bay in northern Tasmania where it arrived yesterday.  The ship’s  captain notified authorities upon arrival that he had discovered two stowaways on board  without lawful authority to enter Australia.   

 Allegations have been made that Customs officers spent only a few minutes with each man;  failed to conduct the questioning with interpreters present (an important issue given neither  man apparently speaks English); and asked only a couple of very general questions about why  they had left their countries and stowed away.  If a formal interview with trained officials and  qualified interpreters present has not yet occurred, it must take place immediately so that an  assessment can be made about whether these young men must be brought ashore for their  claims to be further examined.   

 As in all asylum seeker matters, whenever difficult issues arise, a shroud of secrecy descends  from the Howard Government, preventing access by Australians to the truth.     

 With the Government’s crackdown on asylum seekers coming by leaky boat, and the  disruption to people smuggling networks, seaports are an obvious new target for people  smugglers.  Despite Labor’s calls for some time, the Government has done nothing to increase  vigilance at our ports and ensure border protection applies to all entry points to Australia.
