 IMMIGRATION INITIATIVES ON IYDP '

 A  program of eight initiatives by the Department of 

 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs during the International Year of 

 Disabled Persons was announced today by the Minister for .  

 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ian Macphee.

 A  nation-wide phone-in to collect information on disabled 

 migrants and their needs is one of these initiatives.

 The phone-in,  which began on 12 October,  is using the 

 Australia-wide facilities of the Telephone Interpreter Service 

 (TIS).  It will give migrants the chance to tell the Department 

 of- special problems they face,  and to suggest possible solutions.

 .  Other IYDP initiatives to be taken b y  the Department of 

 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs include:

 â¢  .  a research study of the English language training

 needs of disabled migrants in the Melbourne area 

 to be undertaken by Monash University;

 .  accreditation of deaf mute sign language interpreters 

 by the National Accreditation Authority for 

 Translators and Interpreters (NAATI);

 .  a Migrant Project Subsidy Scheme grant of $4 900 

 to enable the Ethnic Disabled Council of South 

 Australia to survey the needs of handicapped 

 migrants in institutions in South Australia;

 .  a $5 000 Migrant Projects Subsidy Scheme grant to

 the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria to produce 

 a directory of social services catering for disabled 

 people within ethnic communities;

 .  promotion of the Employment Nomination Scheme to help 

 employers and relevant organisations to find people 

 with appropriate skills to assist the disabled;

 .  a limited intake of disabled refugees,  some to be 

 sponsored under the Community Refugee Settlement 

 Scheme,  others to accompany or join close relatives 

 .  able to provide support;  .

 .  an information program directed at migrant workers and 

 employers about repetitive movement injuries such as 

 tenosynovitis.  .

 "Because of selection procedures,  migrants generally can be 

 said to be healthier and fitter than many Australian-born,"

 Mr Macphee said. .  ^ .

 "Nevertheless they are subject to the hazards of life which 

 can leave them disabled.

 ’  "Their disabilities are made more acute when coupled with 

 inability to speak English - cutting them off from many community 

 services.  .

 "Migrants when disabled have special problems to overcome 

 in a new society.

 "The initiatives being taken by the Department of Immigration 

 and. Ethnic Affairs will alleviate problems ,  and give government 

 bodies better information on the types of problems disabled 

 migrants face."
