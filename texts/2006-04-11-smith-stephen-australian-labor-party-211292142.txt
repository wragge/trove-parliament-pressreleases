 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  - ABC STUDIO, EAST  PERTH  -  TUESDAY, 11 APRIL 2006   

 SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT MODELLING ON MINIMUM WAGE;  NEWSPOLL; COLE ROYAL COMMISSION AND ASYLUM  SEEKERS FROM WEST PAPUA.   

 SMITH: Overnight we see Freedom of Information documents released which see  the Government absolutely committed to reducing the Minimum Wage.     

 This Freedom of Information advice shows that if the Government’s submissions to the  Industrial Relations Commission had been agreed to, the assertion in economics interests  is that the number of jobs in Australia would have increased.  The Government didn’t  release this modelling just as it didn’t release the Treasury documentation which showed 

 that productivity would be suppressed in the short term as a result of the Government’s  industrial relations changes.   

 No wonder the Government didn’t release it, because it confirms the Government’s  intention here is to reduce wages.  And the community are clearly on to that.  The  Australian community are clearly onto the fact that these changes are nothing more and  nothing less than an attempt to reduce their wages.     

 That’s why they regard these proposals as unacceptable.  As Nick Minchin, the number 3  man in the Government, said to the HR Nicholls Society, the Australian community  violently disagrees with these proposals.  That’s confirmed by the Government refusing  to release that modelling we see overnight, and it’s also confirmed by the evidence we  see in today’s papers about the community reaction two weeks into the Government’s  extreme changes.   

 JOURNALIST: …. the FOI document?   

 SMITH: No I haven’t.  I’ve seen the report in The Australian which obtained them.   But it’s quite clear that the documents continue the assertion that if you reduce wages  then you somehow magically increase employment.  That’s not borne out by the  Australian experience, where we’ve seen minimum wage increase despite the  Government.   

 

 We’ve seen Minimum Wages increase in real terms over the last ten years and in  comparable jurisdictions like the United States and the United Kingdom, we have seen  increases in the United Kingdom Minimum Wage and a comparable increase in  employment, and in the United States we haven’t seen an increase in their Minimum  Wage and we haven’t seen a comparable increase in employment at the lower level.   

 

 

 The Government if it had its way would have seen the Minimum Wage reduced by $50 a  week or $2600 a year.  That’s how much people would have been worse off.  The  community is on to them in this matter and that’s why we see in today’s Newspoll people  overwhelmingly saying they can’t see any benefits in these changes for the economy,  they certainly can’t see any benefits in them for themselves, they can’t see any benefits in  them for job creation, and they can’t see any benefits in them for their colleagues in the  Australian community.  That is the resounding ringing bell of Newspoll today.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you also concede that Newspoll also …..?   

 SMITH: I’m not sure that’s right.  We have had our troubles and that’s again  reflected in the Newspoll.  I made the point a few weeks, or a month ago, that given some  of our recent difficulties it was as good a result as we could expect.  But if you look at  Newspoll, again Labor is political competitive with 52% two party preferred.  That  follows on from two weeks ago where we were 53% two party preferred.  And what is  the message of both those results?   

 

 The message of both those results is that if over the long term day in, day out we make  the Government’s massive attack on living standards the essential issue at the next  election campaign we will be politically successful.     

 The two messages in this poll result today are Nick Minchin was right that the  community violently disagrees with the Government’s extreme changes.  They see no  economic benefit in them for our country and they see no economic benefit in them for  themselves.  The message for us is that if we focus on these bread and butter living  standards issues we will be successful politically and we will prevail at the 2007 election. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Is it worrying to you that your Leader is still struggling?   

 SMITH: It doesn’t worry me at all because I made the point two weeks ago and a  month ago, given the circumstances in which we have gone through it will be no surprise.   The movement I see in the polls is the community saying, as Nick Minchin did, ‘we  violently disagree with the Government’s extreme industrial relations changes’ and that’s  reflected in the Liberal Party polling and the approval rating for John Howard.   

 JOURNALIST:  …the  AWB  commission….    

 SMITH: Yesterday we saw the Deputy Prime Minister saying that he saw nothing  and knew nothing either because he deliberately turned a blind eye or because he was  completely incompetent.  He saw no evil, he heard no evil and he sought out no evil.   And what was the evil?  The evil was $300 million to Saddam Hussein.  That was the evil  and he either deliberately turned a blind eye to that or he was so incompetent it passed  him completely by.  I expect a similar response from Alexander today when he is before  the Commission.   

 

 But bear this in mind, as the Commissioner as made clear in recent times including  yesterday, the terms of reference will not allow and do not allow a proper examination  and a proper conclusion to be made about the incompetence, the neglect or the deliberate  turning of a blind eye by Ministers Vaile and Downer.  They simply go, the terms of  reference simply go to whether criminal charges ought to be brought against AWB or its  officers.   

 But what did the Australian public see yesterday?  The Australian public yesterday saw at  best an incompetent Deputy Prime Minister and at worst a Deputy Prime Minister who  deliberately turned a blind eye to $300 million worth of evil going to Saddam Hussein at  precisely the time the Government was saying we were at war with them. 

 

 JOURNALIST: …if Labor can’t make in roads against the Government now when  there are these IR changes which so many people are opposed to, what hope is there for  Labor to picking up ground in the run up to the next election?   

 SMITH: As I’ve said on numerous occasions, we’ll have thousands of polls  between now and the next election, and in the end the old clichÃ© that there’s only one that  counts.  But so far as Labor picking up support, the last few Newspolls I have seen 53%  and 52% to Labor, as against 47% and 48% for the Coalition.  On that basis Labor wins  the election.     

 My own judgement is that we are a long way from that.  But the point to us is crystal  clear.  And the point from the community is crystal clear.  The community violently  disagrees with John Howard’s extreme changes.  They know they are an attack upon their  wages and their conditions.  They are an attack upon their job security.  The message to  us is that if we focus on these bread and butter issues, these living standard issues, and  make them the defining issue at the next election campaign we will be successful  politically and we will win that election.   

 JOURNALIST: …..asylum seekers for West Papua?   

 SMITH: I’m happy to leave the detail of that to my colleague Tony Burke, but the  only point I will make is that if the Government does review, as it says it is, the  circumstances about the assessment of refugees’ applications, that needs to apply across  the board.  You can’t satisfy our international obligations by having one rule for people  coming from one country seeking refugee status and a different rule for people coming  from other countries.   

 

 So whatever is the outcome of the review, whatever changes are made, they can’t apply  or be Indonesia specific.  They can only apply across the board.  We want to be a good  international citizen that satisfies our international obligations here, and the only way we  can do that is by properly assessing those people that come to us seeking refugee status  and doing that in a clear, transparent and fair way.
