 Media release   Senator Kate Lundy Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister   27 September 2011  Sense of belonging key to social harmony  An overwhelming majority of Australians have a strong sense of belonging and pride in our way of life, according to new research released by the Scanlon Foundation.   Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, today launched the Mapping Social Cohesion Report 2011 which examines people’s attitudes on a range of topics from social harmony, immigration, asylum seekers, intolerance, and trust in Government.   “The report confirms over 94 per cent of respondents have a strong sense of belonging and a majority support policies that foster and maintain a shared sense of community,” Senator Lundy said.   “A sense of belonging is an essential cornerstone to support a cohesive society and this finding paints a positive picture of Australia as a harmonious country.”  The Scanlon Foundation report was prepared by Monash University Professor Andrew Markus and involved a national survey of 2000 Australians, measuring their attitudes to 81 questions.   The survey reflects the long term shift in attitude towards acceptance of successive waves of migrants and confirms Australia’s investment in settlement services has strengthened social cohesion.   “The report affirms our policy framework for a multicultural nation and highlights how Australia’s settlement services have built and sustained participation in our community and fostered inclusion.    “We know that new migrants face challenges when they arrive in Australia and our settlement services safeguard social cohesion and promote integration.  “Since the end of the Second World War over 7 million migrants have peacefully settled into the Australian community and today 44 per cent of Australians were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was.  “While the report confirms Australians are very accepting of Australians from diverse backgrounds, the survey does find that there are some negative sentiments towards immigrants from the Middle East.   

 “The report highlights that while each generation may express some anxiety about  the new and the unfamiliar, settlement services and multicultural policies facilitate  inclusion and engender social cohesion in the long term,” concluded Senator Lundy.    

 Some of the key findings of the report include:  â¢ 9 out of 10 respondents (89 per cent) are happy with their lives;   â¢ More than half (56 per cent) of respondents support the proposition that we  need more people for economic growth;   â¢ 2 out of 3 respondents (73 per cent) were positive to asylum seekers who 

 arrived after having been assessed overseas; and   â¢ Negative sentiment towards immigrants from non English-speaking countries  was higher than sentiment towards immigrants from English-speaking  countries.
