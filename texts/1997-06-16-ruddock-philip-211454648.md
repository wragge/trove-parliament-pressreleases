  NEW MEMBERS FOR REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 

  Forty-one new members have been appointed to the Refugee Review Tribunal, the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Philip Ruddock said today. 

  ''The appointment of 24 full-time members and 17 part-time members for various periods  of time signals the successful conclusion to an exhaustive selection process," Mr  Ruddock said. 

  "The new members have a variety of backgrounds, including experience with the law  and in refugee matters both in Australia and overseas, and in the multicultural and  human rights fields." 

  "Today's announcement, together with the 19 re-appointments of current members   " 

  announced on 9 June, would help ensure the effective operation of the RRT into the  future." 

  650 applications were received following national advertising in March this year. A  selection panel made recommendations to the Minister after assessing applications  against specific criteria . 

  "Tribunal members need to be impartial and free from bias, and it is their duty to fully  know and understand the parameters of refugee policy and to work within the legal  framework," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "I am confident the 41 new members have the experience, foresight and breadth of  vision necessary to carry out their role successfully and I congratulate them on their  appointments." 

  "The Government has reviewed migration decision-making, with particular attention  being paid to the membership, role and performance of the RRT and the Immigration  Review Tribunal (IRT)." 

  The RRT is the independent review organisation which considers decisions made by  the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse applications for  protection visas (ie refugee status).
