 Tsunami:  Demands DIMIA response for detainees   

 Labor’s Shadow Minister for Immigration, Mr Laurie Ferguson, has joined calls from the  Sri Lankan community and refugee advocates for special consideration of the plight of  detainees affected by the recent devastating tsunami.   

 “Certainly our priority must be effective foreign aid delivery to rebuild these societies  and to assist marginalised communities’ whose long-term livelihood has been affected.   

 Nevertheless, there are numerous refugee claimants from Sri Lanka and possibly  Indonesia’s Aceh province whose situation merits a particular humanitarian response.”  Mr Ferguson said.   

 “In the case of people who hail from areas already directly affected and those that may  suffer if disease spreads due to forced relocation, I implore the Minister that there be no  forced deportations”.  Mr Ferguson added.   

 Mr Ferguson said that that the Minister and the Department had a number of options  including; compassionate consideration of s417 Ministerial discretion applications and  bridging visas to claimants from these specific areas.  There is a need for strengthened  monitoring by DFAT and DIMIA of the practical human rights impacts of the tsunami  

 

 “Many of the detainees have lost family, suffered property loss and/or experienced family  displacement.  In both nations there have been long-term internal armed struggles.   International media has focused on the re-emergence of these issues in connection with  the allocation of aid.  Sending people back to these regions would raise very significant  moral issues.  I urge that the Minister and Department display the necessary compassion  to these unfortunate people.”   

 “This is a unique disaster.  It must be viewed that way.  Any people accepted through  these suggestions should not come from the yearly refugee/humanitarian planned intake.”
