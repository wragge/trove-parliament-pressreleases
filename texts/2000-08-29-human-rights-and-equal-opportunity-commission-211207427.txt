 Media Release 29 August 2000

 Human Rights Commission Responds to UN Committees Reform Announcement The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has commented on the statements issued today by Ministers Ruddock, Williams and Downer in relation to Australia's participation in the United Nations committee system.

 "The Ministers' position betrays a bunker mentality. It is an overreaction to criticisms levelled at Australia by two UN treaty committees this year on a number of grounds," says Professor Alice Tay, President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

 "The role of committees is to assist signatory countries to improve their compliance with their international undertakings in the interests of citizens' rights.

 "In becoming a signatory Australia must be willing to conduct itself according to the collective statements entered into in signing international conventions.

 "Therefore we welcome the call to strengthen the resources available to the committees for research and analysis. Every process needs to subject itself to continual reform to promote improved efficiency and effectiveness. The UN treaty committee system is no exception.

 "However we find some elements of the position adopted by the Government today a cause for regret.

 "The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against All Forms of Discrimination Against Women would give Australian women an opportunity to take their concerns to the relevant committee in the event that no remedy is available in Australia.

 "The Government's blanket rejection of this Protocol is in stark contrast with the Ministers' stated commitment to reform and strengthening of the effectiveness of the system.

 "It pre-empts the committee processes foreshadowed to coordinate future interaction with the treaty committees; it pre-empts the imminent findings of the Parliamentary Sub-Committee which has been reviewing Australia's relationships with the UN, but most importantly it leaves concerns for women's issues out in the cold," Professor Tay says.

 "Other causes for concern include the rejection of so-called unwarranted requests from treaty committees to delay removal of asylum seekers from

 Australia. The objective of such requests for delay is to maintain the status quo pending full investigation of their claims. Such requests are based on the claim that the individual risks torture or even death if removed from Australia."

 On the issue of the reform of UN refugee bodies, Professor Tay says that the statement is sadly lacking a sense of human compassion and reflects an unrealistic view of the circumstances facing people in some parts of the world.

 "Much in what the Ministers have announced will become clear only upon implementation of the stated intentions", Professor Tay says. "The Human Rights Commission looks forward to joining other interested parties in the process of strengthening and reform."
