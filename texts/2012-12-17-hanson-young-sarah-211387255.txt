 Statement on the cost of offshore processing and the slashing of the aid budget   

 17 December 2012   

 “We shouldn’t be cutting the aid budget to pay for the Australian Government’s cruelty,” the Greens  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Labor’s offshore processing and indefinite detention of refugees is a never ending black hole that is  costing the tax payer billions of dollars.   

 “This extra $400m is just the most recent blowout in the cost of indefinite offshore detention.   

 “The best way for the Government to save money is to have a time limit on detention and to ensure  people’s claims for asylum are processed quickly.   

 “Onshore community assessment is 90 per cent cheaper and 100 per cent more humane.   

 “Julia Gillard’s race to the bottom with Tony Abbott is costing lives, refugee’s mental health and  billions of dollars.”
