 Human Rights of Detainees not Breached in Detention MPS 035/2001

 The Government disagrees with the findings of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) in relation to two former asylum seekers in Australia, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said today.

 "The Commission has failed to understand the way in which immigration detention works, and as a result has drawn misleading conclusions in its report," Mr Ruddock said.

 In a report tabled in parliament today, the commission concluded that the department had been in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in relation to two complainants, and should pay $20,000 and $15,000 to each individual.

 "I am satisfied that my department was not in breach of the ICCPR and so will not be making any payments to these individuals," Mr Ruddock said.

 "In respect of the commission's findings, the department informed the complainants of the facilities available for accessing legal advice within three weeks of entering detention.

 "Both complainants were also provided with assistance through the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme, in applying for protection visas.

 "HREOC has equated arrival separation in immigration detention centres with 'incommunicado detention'. As we have pointed out to them before, this is simply wrong.

 "In separation detention, detainees are able to communicate with relatives overseas in particular, to let them know they have arrived safely.

 "Detainees are also free to interact with others at the same stage of processing, and have access on request to the Red Cross, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, HREOC, legal advisers and consular officials.

 "However, they are not able to communicate initially, with those at a more advanced stage of processing in order to protect the integrity of the protection visa process.

 "This ensures that Australia's resources are directed at those with genuine claims for protection and not those who would abuse the process in order to enter Australia," Mr Ruddock said.

 Mr Ruddock said the department had made continuous improvements in the processing of asylum claims, including the provision of advice and assistance for detainees, notwithstanding the unprecedented boat arrivals since mid-1999.
