 Shadow Minister For Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 LAURIE FERGUSON MP 

 18 November 2003   BOTANY MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRE - YET ANOTHER  CLOSURE 

 Community concerns about the future of Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) have  increased following Minister Hardgrave’s decision to withdraw core funding from the  Botany Centre in Sydney as from 31 January. Given the earlier closure of the Ashfield  Centre, the decision means that Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs, Inner City and Inner  West regions will shortly be without access to an MRC.  

 

 There has been considerable concern about the Coalition’s intentions towards MRCs  throughout its Settlement Services Review. These concerns were not allayed by the  release of the Review report or by the inadequate feedback given during the  subsequent community consultations. 

 

 Since the 2001 election, core funding has been withdrawn from 5 Centres - in Alice  Springs, Ashfield, Footscray, Glenroy and now Botany, and several others were  placed on short term funding contracts. Not one new Centre has opened in the same  period.  

 

 The Opposition has adopted a responsible position in the case of Centres that have  been experiencing genuine management difficulties and where interim replacement  services have been put in place. Obviously neither circumstance applies to the  Botany decision, which could herald a significant assault by the Government. 

 

 Very recently Immigration Department staff denied that MRC core funding was to be  amalgamated with a separate funding program for migrant welfare projects,  threatening their long term future. In the absence of any formal statement to the  contrary from Minister Hardgrave, it appears increasingly apparent that the Coalition  is happy to reduce the number of funded MRCs bit by bit.  

 

 Labor knows that Migrant Resource Centres are a crucial element of our settlement  system for migrants and refugees. They offer multilingual information, advice and  referral services, provide a base for sessional ethno-specific services, and foster the  development of new services to address the specific needs of their region.
