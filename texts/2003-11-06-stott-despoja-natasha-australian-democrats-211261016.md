 6 November 2003                  MEDIA RELEASE                                   03/804               

 

 Welcome decision on Sammaki children   

 The Australian Democrats today welcomed the Immigration Minister’s compassionate intervention  in the case of the Sammaki family.   

 Democrats’ Senator for South Australia, Natasha Stott Despoja, said the Government’s decision to  grant Ibrahim Sammaki permanent residency on humanitarian grounds would reunite a grieving  family.   

 Senator Stott Despoja and South Australian Democrats’ MLC Kate Reynolds applied to sponsor  visiting visas for the children more than six months ago, with the support of Magistrate Brian  Deegan. Their applications were rejected.   

 “I congratulate the Government on putting the interests of the children first,” said Senator Stott  Despoja.    

 “Over the past two years, four year old Sara and eight year old Sabda have had to shoulder  harrowing experiences most adults would struggle to bear.   

 “Mr Sammaki will now be able to apply for visas for Sara and Sabda, so they can come to live with  him in Australia.   

 “After holding the hand of the Prime Minister in Bali last month, the children will now be able to  hold the hand of their father for the first time in more than two years.   

 “This is a heartening outcome.   

 “We hope the children are reunited with their father as soon as possible,” concluded Senator Stott  Despoja.
