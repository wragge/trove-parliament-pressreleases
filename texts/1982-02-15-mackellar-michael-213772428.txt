 FROM THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTER FOR HEALTH  THE HON. M  J. R. MACKELLAR

 GRANTS FOR HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 The Minister for Health, the Hon. Michael MacKellar,  

 announced today details of seven grants totalling $96 672 

 awarded for research into and development of health services 

 in Australia.

 Mr MacKellar said the grants are available for research 

 into the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery 

 and for the development of improved health services.

 The awards include $59 422 for four continuing grants 

 and $37 250 for three new projects approved by the Minister.

 Funding for the third year of an evaluation of QUITS 

 smoking cessation programs is included in the continuing 

 grants.  The project aims to compare the effectiveness of five 

 different programs and to define the characteristics of 

 smokers who succeed in giving up the habit.

 A three-and-a-half-year study of coronary care units 

 in a number of hospitals in Queensland and New South Wales 

 to determine the cost effectiveness of various levels of 

 hospital care will be completed next year with a grant to 

 the Health Commission of NSW.

 Mr MacKellar said the three new grants awarded are 

 concerned with improving the efficiency of patient care.

 At Newcastle Hospital an attempt will be made to improve 

 the quality of inpatient care by regular audit and feedback 

 of results to clinicians. Computerised hospital-based systems 

 will be developed for medical records by the NSW Institute 

 of Technology and a register of cancer patients at the Prince 

 of Wales and Prince Henry Hospitals.
