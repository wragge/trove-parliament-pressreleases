 16 July 2002 HARDGRAVE BLAMES CRIME ON PARENTS’ LANGUAGE SKILLS

 It is utterly extraordinary that Minister Hardgrave appears to believe that crime is caused by migrant children being able to speak English better than their parents can.

 A front-page story in yesterday’s Courier-Mail reports the Minister’s bizarre view that crime was spiralling out of control because of a language barrier between migrants and their Australian-born children.

 The Minister went on to allege that in many Vietnamese households the parents don’t practise their English language skills and the children don’t practise their Vietnamese language skills. The Minister would apparently have us believe that many Vietnamese families can thus only speak to each other with the assistance of interpreters. This is patently ridiculous.

 The only problem with the Minister’s naive theory is that the Vietnamese second generation has been identified as one of the top three groups that is most likely to speak their parents’ language at home. The report Second generation Australians, personally launched by Minister Hardgrave on 23 May, says:

 Compared to other second generation (migrants), the second generation of Slav-Macedonian, Turkish or Vietnamese origin were the most likely to retain the use of their parents’ native language at home” (p.50).

 There are issues of crime and community safety in Australia that we should be able to debate in an informed and mature fashion. Mr Hardgrave’s inflammatory outburst contributes nothing positive to such a debate.

 Since 1975 Vietnamese refugees have set out to build a better life for their families in Australia in the face of major difficulties. At 93.4% they have consistently had one of the highest take up rates of Australian citizenship. They have been determined to provide their children with the educational and other opportunities that they themselves were never able to enjoy. Official data shows they have been remarkably successful in doing so, with second generation Vietnamese likely to achieve excellent educational outcomes in Australia.

 It is offensive to suggest that we have a crime problem in Australia because many earlier refugees and migrants did not manage to acquire satisfactory English language skills. No evidence has been produced for this simplistic assertion, which blackens the name of thousands of decent law-abiding Australians.

 Naturally many Vietnamese who first arrived here as refugees aspired to accomplish better English skills. But in the hard grind of earning a living and establishing themselves in a new country, doing so was often far more difficult than Minister Hardgrave thinks.

 We should be entitled to expect better than this outburst from a Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. Not only because Mr Hardgrave puts forward a flawed analysis but also because he offers no constructive solutions. He does not offer to expand the availability of English classes, including to holders of temporary protection visas. He does not offer to fund programs to overcome generational conflicts within ethnic communities. He does not propose strategies to overcome barriers of distrust between Police Forces and migrant groups.

 Unlike the Government, the Opposition has committed itself to constructive measures to deal with proper concerns about crime and community safety. To this end Mr Crean announced on 26 May that a Labor Government would pool resources with State and local Governments to create Community Safety Zones.
