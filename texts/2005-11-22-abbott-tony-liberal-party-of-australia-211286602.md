 New MBS health check for refugees 

 

 The Commonwealth Government will introduce a new Medicare item to encourage GPs to  provide comprehensive health assessments of refugees and other humanitarian entrants within  six months of their arrival in Australia.   

 This new Medicare health assessment item will help identify refugeesâ€™ physical and mental  health needs and initiate preventative action and treatment.  Early intervention will reduce the  long term cost to the community of untreated ailments.     

 The new item will allow doctors to target and treat complex and serious medical conditions  and will take into account the time and effort required to provide this service, particularly  when doctors are faced with language and cultural barriers.     

 The item will add to the already extensive range of support programs the Australian  Government has in place for refugees when they come to Australia.     

 The new item should be introduced in May 2006 following discussions with GP and refugee  representative groups. More information on the health assessment item will be provided  closer to implementation.
