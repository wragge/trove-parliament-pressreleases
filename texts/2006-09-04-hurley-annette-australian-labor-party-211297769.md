 Robb’s own figures on Adult Migrant English  Programme shows Howard Government is responsible  for migrants not learning English   

 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs,  Andrew Robb, claimed that the Labor Party’s statement of the Howard  Government reducing the migrant English programme’s funding by almost $11  million was “wrong”.   

 “Mr Robb needs to pay more attention to what is happening during Senate  Estimates,” stated Sen. Hurley, Labor’s spokeswoman for Multicultural Affairs.    

 “In February of this year it was clearly stated by a senior DIMA official that the  Adult Migrant English Programme’s funding had been cut by $10.8 million 2.”   

 “Further to this, it was also revealed in that same Estimates hearing that  enrolments into the AMEP programme had increased by almost 2, 200 migrant  students 3 at the same time. That makes no sense at all.” 

 

 Andrew Robb also stated that the Government increased its Adult Migrant  English Programme (AMEP) funding by $36.8 million.    

 What Mr Robb didn’t tell us was that this funding was over a four year period and  was announced the same year the Howard Government increased its refugee  intake from 4, 000 (in 2003) to 13, 000 this year 1.   

 “Under the Howard Government, refugee numbers have increased dramatically.  The funding that Andrew Robb is quick to talk about is simply not keeping up with  the Governments refugee programme,” stated Sen. Hurley.   

 “The Howard Government has said it themselves - many of our arriving refugees  have literacy needs that require special assistance. 

 

 “Those migrants keen to learn English should be given the opportunity so that  they can contribute to our economy. John Howard needs to deal with the failure  of his own Government to provide adequate migrant English language  programmes rather than just talk about it,” she concluded.
