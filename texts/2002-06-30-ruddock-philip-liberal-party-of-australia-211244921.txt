 MINISTER COMMENDS SA POLICE FOR ASSISTANCE

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock has  today  commended  South  Australian  Police  for  their  efforts  in  recapturing escapees from Woomera and those allegedly assisting them.

 Mr  Ruddock  said  he  would  like  to  thank  the  officers  concerned  for  the  time  and diligence that had led to the recapture of 25 escapees.

 Local  Police  had  responded  quickly  to  the  incident  and  the  Commonwealth  has already  given  an  undertaking  that  the  state  would  be  compensated  for  reasonable costs over and above normal operational requirements.

 Mr  Ruddock  said  that  he  regretted  that  the  South  Australian  Police  Minister,  Mr Conlon  has  sought  to  politicise  the  issue,  because  it  was  important  to  work cooperatively on this matter.

 Escapes from detention are not a new phenomenon and happened many times when the  ALP  was  in  government,  so  Mr  Conlon  cannot  support  his  claim  that  other detention centres had not experienced ongoing problems.

 Departmental records show 25 people escaped from a detention centre in 1991, 22 in another incident in 1992, 29 in two separate incidents in 1993-94 and 100 from the Curtin Centre in WA in May 1995. Hostages were taken and people escaped during another disturbance at Curtin in June 1995.

 Most  of  those  who  escaped  from  Woomera  on  Friday  had  been  found  not  to  be refugees and were appealing through the courts or were awaiting removal, although some had not been cooperating with those efforts.

 It  is  important  that  detainees  and  their  supporters  are  reminded  by  the  state government that this is a country where the rule of law applies.
