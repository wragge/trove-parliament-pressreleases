 Cancelled Indonesia trip: PM is embarrassment to Australia - Milne  

 The Australian Greens say Tony Abbott’s cruel refugee policy and Operation Sovereign Borders  condemns Australia to a deteriorated relationship with Indonesia.  

 “This is Tony Abbott in action. He is an embarrassment internationally and at home,” Greens Leader  Christine Milne said.  

 "With Indonesia having already expressed its extreme displeasure at Australia dumping life boats in  Indonesian waters, imagine how embarrassing it would have been for President Yudhoyono to have  to stand with Tony Abbott as a group of dehydrated, sick and desperate refugees in an orange life  boat drifted back from Australia.  

 “The Prime Minister should be doing everything he can to repair the relationship. A meeting with the  Indonesian President would have been a step in the right direction and this cancellation is an  opportunity lost.  

 “Tony Abbott is hoist on his own petard. It is because of his own cruel refugee policy that he stood  to embarrass the President and that our relationship with Indonesia has been so damaged in the  first place.  

 “It is very clear that Indonesia wants to heal the relationship as does Australia, but while the Abbott  government continues to tow life boats back into Indonesian waters with a view to them drifting  back to the coast somewhere, it will continue to jeopardise the relationship."
