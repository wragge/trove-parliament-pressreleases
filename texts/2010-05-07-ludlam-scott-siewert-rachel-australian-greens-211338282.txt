 Rachel Siewert  Australian Greens  Media Release 

 Greens Senators join protest outside Perth  Detention Centre  

 Media Release | Spokesperson Rachel Siewert, Scott Ludlam  

 Friday 7th May 2010, 1:18pm 

 Australian Greens Senators Rachel Siewert and Scott Ludlam will join community groups who will be 

 camping from dusk tonight, Friday 7 May, until dawn at the Perth Domestic Airport Immigration Detention 

 Centre.   

 WHEN:       Protest starts 6pm. Call numbers below for details about the evening. 

 WHERE:     Perth Domestic Airport Immigration Centre, corner Baker & McComb roads - opposite the 

 boom gates to the short term parking at the Perth Domestic Airport, Redcliffe WA 

 Senator Rachel Siewert, who recently visited detainees in the detention centre, said she was joining the 

 protest because once again the detention centre was being used to hold asylum-seekers. 

 

 “The Greens oppose the suspension of Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum claims as a backward and fear-driven approach,” Senator Siewert said. 

 “As the recent report of the UNHCR on Sri Lanka has clearly proven, the situation has simply not improved; 

 the grounds for this policy shift are baseless.”  

 Senator Scott Ludlam said he was concerned at the use of the airport centre and the plan to reopen Curtin 

 Detention Centre. 

 “The government’s freeze on new asylum claims from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka mean there will likely be 

 more.  This freeze on two groups - Tamils and Hazaras - is a violation of the UN Convention on Refugees 

 and our Racial Discrimination Act,” Senator Ludlam said. 

 The Greens oppose the government’s recent decision to reopen the Curtin Detention Centre and will be 

 requesting permission to inspect the facility when travelling to the region in the coming months.
