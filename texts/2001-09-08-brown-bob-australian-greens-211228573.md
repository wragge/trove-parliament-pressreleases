 Howard Follows Hanson on Asylum-Seekers

 Greens Senator Bob Brown says John Howard has taken up Pauline Hanson’s idea of changing the status of Christmas Island to deal with asylum-seekers.

 “I will be opposing this in the Senate.

 “Labor and the Democrats should also oppose it and in particular oppose any effort to fast-track the legislation. The normal process is to introduce legislation in one session, have it considered by a Senate committee and then debated in the following session. That’s what should happen here”, said Senator Brown.

 Senator Brown will comment further tomorrow (Sunday) in Melbourne
