 MEDIA RELEASE 

 22 September 2011 

 BACK TO BASICS, AND PRINCIPLES 

 INDEPENDENT MP for Lyne Rob Oakeshott says the answer to Australia’s asylum seeker question  lies in an existing regional framework supported by more than 40 countries, including Nauru and  Malaysia, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 

 The Bali Process, which is co-chaired by the governments of Indonesia and Australia, was  established nine years ago during the Howard Government era and has been supported by  successive federal governments, including the Gillard Government. 

 “The Bali process is an established, regional approach to border control, law enforcement and  people smuggling, that provides for a sustainable approach to current migration issues facing our  country,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “At the same time, it allows Australia to maintain a flexible approach to domestic policy. 

 “By supporting this regional process, the focus on short-term political opportunism that is framing  the current debate is removed, without limiting Australia’s opportunity to coordinate an approach  that current or future governments consider necessary.  

 “It would allow for consideration of a range of measures including, but not limited to, offshore  processing, onshore processing or community detention. 

 “To insist that the solution to this complicated problem lies with only Malaysia or Nauru,  substantially limits the controls available to deal with foreign and domestic migration. 

 “Both Malaysia & Nauru are signatories to the Bali Process, and Labor and Liberal Parties need to  understand this reality.  

 “The solution lies in the strength of our relationship with all of our regional neighbours, and with  an agreement already on the table which already has the support of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees and the Director General of the International Organisation for  Migration,” Mr Oakeshott said.
