 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Changes To Protection Visa System

 MPS 56/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced a package of  regulation changes to enhance consistency and integrity in the protection visa system for asylum seekers in Australia.

 The existing Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) arrangements applying to unauthorised arrivals have been broadened so that  they will now also apply to people who make a protection visa application after arriving in Australia lawfully. 

 This change will not affect existing protection visa applicants. Nor will it affect people who are resettled in Australia under  the Offshore Humanitarian Program. Unlawful arrivals will continue to be covered by the TPV arrangements.

 'The change will align Australia's protection arrangements with international protection objectives which emphasise that for  most refugees the appropriate response is to provide interim protection until they can return home in safety, ' Mr Ruddock  said. 

 It also reflects the situation between 1989 and 1994 when people requiring protection were only granted temporary visas.

 All people owed refugee protection by Australia will continue to receive protection.

 The regulations will also enable around 2,400 TPV holders to become eligible for permanent protection if they are found to  have an ongoing need for protection. These TPV holders did not lodge an application for a further protection visa before  legislative changes in 2001 prevented them from accessing a permanent protection visa in future. 

 'These balanced changes will ensure Australia's onshore protection arrangements are consistent and fair, and will assist in  upholding the integrity of our humanitarian resettlement program,' Mr Ruddock said.

 'Where TPV holders are no longer in need of Australia's protection, their places are reassigned to the Humanitarian Program  to resettle refugees and others of concern who are in the greatest need.

 'Recent experience with changing country situations and new security concerns clearly show the value of being able to  reassess whether a person has a continuing need for protection before conferring permanent protection and stay.

 'The changes will also reduce incentives for the misuse of our onshore protection provisions by people who have abandoned  protection elsewhere because they would prefer to live in Australia,' Mr Ruddock said.

 The introduction of the TPV in October 1999 had proved to be a successful tool in protecting Australia's capacity to contribute  to international efforts to help refugees. 

 'The new regulations also include a power for me to allow people who arrived lawfully, and who are in need of protection, to  have immediate access to a Permanent Protection Visa, where this is in the public interest,' Mr Ruddock said.

 A third change would provide the ability for the grant of TPVs and Temporary Humanitarian Visas for shorter periods than  those currently stated in the regulations. 

 This removes the problem of visas expiring at different times for family members who had arrived separately, and will help  them to be considered for further protection as a group.
