 ONLY FAIR AND WORKABLE MIGRATION LAWS WILL LEAD TO A  DECLINE IN MINISTERIAL INTERVENTION   

 Democrats Deputy Leader Andrew Bartlett has condemned the Immigration Minister’s announcement  that legislation will possibly be tightened to prevent asylum seekers appealing for ministerial  intervention. 

 “If the Minister made positive and workable changes to the Migration Act then she would no doubt find  that the need for Ministerial intervention would be greatly reduced,” Senator Bartlett said. 

 “The system as it currently stands is fundamentally flawed, unworkable and cruel. 

 “The dysfunctional culture that has developed in DIMA has led directly to poor decisions being made in  cases which have then had to go through the process of appeal and eventually requests for ministerial  intervention. 

 “I have introduced a suite of Private Senator’s Bills which will remove the more offensive and  discriminatory aspect of the Migration Act as well introducing more humane and efficient alternatives.   

 The ninth Bill in this suite, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Enabling Permanent Protection) Bill  2006 was introduced to the Senate today.   

 “If the Minister wants to see a reduction in requests for intervention then I urge her to support the  Democrats’ Bill that will ensure efficiency in the system,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
