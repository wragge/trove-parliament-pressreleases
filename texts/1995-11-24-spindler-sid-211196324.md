 Influx of War Criminals means investigations unit essential

 War criminals from the former Yugoslavia would not be kept out of Australia while Australia allows refugees to enter the country, a parliamentary inquiry was told today.

 "This makes the creation of an investigations unit in Australia essential" said pemocrat Law and Justice Spokesperson Senator Sid Spindler.

 "Australia is no longer just an observer to the events unfolding in the former Yugoslavia. We are now a central player.

 "Not only has Australia been chosen as a favoured destination for nearly 14,000 refugees from the war-zone, but hundreds of Australians who left to fight in the civil war are beginning to return home.

 "Australia is therefore not just becoming a haven for witnesses to atrocities. It is fast becoming a refuge for those who have carried out the atrocities.

 The Senate will be debating the need for new laws to allow for the investigation and prosecution of war criminals in Australia next week.

 For further information, contact Sid Spindler on 0411 22 02 77 (except between 4:40 and 5:50pm today) or (03) 859 5607 over the weekend.
