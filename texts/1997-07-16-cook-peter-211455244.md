  SENATOR PETER COOK 

  Acting Shadow Minister for  Foreign Affairs 

  MEDIA RELEASE  16 July 1997 

  DOWNER :MUST CLARIFY POSITION ON CAMBODIAN ASYLUM  SEEKERS 

  Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, must act promptly to clear up contradicting  accounts as to whether any Cambodian officials sought and were refused political  asylum in Australia after last week's coup. 

  J\11r Downer is reported as categorically denying that any such approaches for asylum 

  were made. 

  Yet, on ABC Television last night and in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning,  human rights workers in Cambodia report that it is well known that a senior member  of the royalist Funcinpec Party approached the Australian Embassy last week for  assistance. 

  Apparently Mr Downer's office and DF AT officials have dismissed this approach  because it was not 'formal'. 

  If this is the case, the question must be asked what constitutes a 'formal' approach in  the face of complete political and military upheaval. 

  The Australian Government must be consistent in its concern for the human rights of  the people of Cambodia. 

  Did an official approach the Australian Embassy seeking asylum? 

  Have any other Cambodian nationals approached the Embassy for asylum? 

  The Federal Opposition calls on Mr Downer to explain the apparent conflict in the  accounts being given by his office and his Department and the reports coming from  the media and human rights groups in Cambodia.
