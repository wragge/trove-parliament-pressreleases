 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling MORE BOATS AS MONSOON SEASON  APPROACHES November 09, 2012

 The  latest  illegal  boat,  with  54  people  on  board,  comes  as  arrivals  continue  to  accelerate  on  the  eve  of  the  dangerous monsoon  season,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott  Morrison  and  Shadow  Minister  for  Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “The  continued  record  rate  of  arrivals  is  occurring  just  weeks  from  the  onset  of  the  monsoon  season  which  will  greatly increase the risk of the already dangerous boat journey to Australia,” Mr Morrison said.

 “The risk to life at sea increases dramatically over the monsoon season when tropical storms are a common occurrence bringing high seas and strong winds.

 “Reports that our Navy patrol vessels are experiencing a record number of faults as they continue to be overwhelmed on our borders under Labor’s failure, are particularly disturbing given their potential role in rescues during this time.

 “Customs is also  under huge  pressure, with its annual  report revealing  it is struggling  to meet minimum patrol days for some vessels due to the huge workload of intercepting illegal boats.

 “Given their continued refusal to restore the full proven Coalition measures that worked to stop the boats, the government should boost resources on our north west coast to ensure that every available asset is available to respond to potential emergencies at sea,” Mr Morrison said.

  Mr Keenan said: “There have now been more arrivals this calendar year than in the previous three years combined under  Labor.

 “Labor has finally resorted to sending home asylum seekers who do not have legitimate claims of asylum but like  everything Labor has done with this issue it is just too little too late.

 “Labor sent back home 93 people this week when we have had 836 people arrive - that is a flood of illegal arrivals yet  they only send a trickle home.

 “This Government proves once again that they just do not have the courage or the conviction to implement the tough  border protection policies needed to squash people smuggling,” Mr Keenan said.
