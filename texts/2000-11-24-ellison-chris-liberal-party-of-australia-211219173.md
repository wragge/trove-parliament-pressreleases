 SENATOR THE HON. CHRISTOPHER ELLISON

 Special Minister of State Senator for Western Australia

  

 E69/00 24 November 2000

 An Apple a Day to Help Perth Students Improve Learning Disadvantaged Perth children are set to share in the benefit’s of an innovative new Federal Government programme designed to improve the nutrition and eating habits of disadvantaged preschool and school children around the country.

 Senator for Western Australia, Chris Ellison, said the National Child Nutrition Programme , would fund a range of practical nutritional programmes including breakfast clubs, and Aussie lunch box guide, school canteen accreditation and a range of curriculum and training packages for schools and day care centres over the next three years.

 "The National Child Nutrition Programme  is designed to improve the nutrition and eating habits of disadvantaged children, and to reduce the long term risks of chronic and preventable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease in later life," Senator Ellison said.

 "Nutrition and learning go hand in hand. A healthy child, with a full stomach and nutritious diet, will have better concentration skills and in turn, will be better able to maximise learning opportunities at school."

 Some of the Perth City Projects funded include - Ngala Family Resource Centre, $150,000 for a breakfast club in Perth’s new Northern Suburbs where some children have been coming to school without food, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Gowie WA Inc, $139,740 to improve nutrition skills through a programme of training and accreditation in family day care centres, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Ngala Family Resource Centre, $150,000 to promote the nutritional advantages of breastfeeding and the introduction of healthy food choices during weaning, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Association for Services to Torture and Trauma Survivors, $217,317 for a pilot programme that aims to improve the health and nutrition of parents and children that have settled in WA as humanitarian refugees.

 "The National Child Nutrition Program represents an important step forward in addressing a range of serious health issues by helping to ensure that children have better access to healthy, fresh foods," Senator Ellison said.

 A total of 92 projects have been awarded in the first round of funding under the Government’s National Child Nutrition Program , with 15 awarded in Western Australia.

 The Federal Government will provide $15 million to a range of community based projects over the next three years.

 A second round of funding under the National Child Nutrition Program , specifically aimed at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school children, will be called early next year.
