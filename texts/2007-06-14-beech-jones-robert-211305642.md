 The Impact of External Administrative Law Review: The Role of the Courts 

 

 Robert Beech - Jones SC1 

 

 1. The papers in this session are concerned with three forms of “external review” 

 of administrative decisions namely tribunals, the Ombudsman and the Courts.  

 In  considering  the  role  of  the  Courts  I  will  briefly  describe  the  nature  and  

 foundations  of  the  review  function  undertaken  by  Courts,  that  is  judicial  

 review,  identify  a  number  of  features  of  judicial  review  and  compare  and  

 contrast them with review undertaken by the Ombudsman and tribunals. I will 

 then consider a particular criticism of judicial review which I consider throws 

 some light on the features I identify. For reasons of both space and time I will 

 concentrate  exclusively  on  the  Federal  sphere  although  some  of  what  is  

 discussed is applicable to judicial review at a State level.2  

 

 Nature of Judicial Review 

 

 2. In Attorney-General v Quinn (1990) 170 CLR 1 Justice Brennan described the 

 function of Courts undertaking judicial review in the following terms3: 

 

 “The duty and jurisdiction of the Court to review administrative action  do  not  go  beyond  the  declaration  and  enforcement  of  the  law  which   determines  the  limits  and  governs  the  exercise  of  the  repository’s   power,  If,  in  doing  so,  the  court  avoids  administrative  injustice  or   error,  so  be  it,  but  the  court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  simply  cure   administrative  injustice  or  error.  The  merits  of  administrative  action,   to the extent to which they can be distinguished from legality, are for  the  repository  of  the  relevant  power  and,  subject  to  political  control,   for the repository alone.”   

 3. Thus  the  Court’s  only  function  is  said  to  be  determining  the  limits  of  the  

 power  of  the  decision  maker  or  the  legality  or  validity  of  the  decision  in  

 question. What is the source and rationale for this function?

 4.  At a federal level the question of source of the power of Courts to engage in 

 judicial  review  invites  further  questions  as  to  the  jurisdiction of the  Court  in  

 question and the source of the legal obligation or limit on power that is alleged 

 to  have  been  transgressed.  With  the  High  Court  its  power  as  a  Court  of  first  

 instance to review the legality of administrative decision making is conferred 

 by the Constitution itself.4 It cannot be removed and any attempt to regulate it 

 will  be  closely  scrutinised.5.   The  High  Court  also  reviews  the  decisions  of  

 lower courts in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.6 The judicial review 

 functions of the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court are conferred 

 and  limited  by  various  pieces  of  federal  legislation  principally  the  

 Administrative  Decisions  (Judicial  Review)  Act  1977  (Cth)  (the  “ADJR”),  

 section  39B  of  the  Judiciary  Act  1903  (Cth)  and  ss  476  to  476B  of  the  

 Migration Act 1958 (Cth).7  

 

 5.  However  this  does  not  answer  all  the  relevant  questions  about  how  one  

 ascertains whether or not in a given case the relevant legal obligation has been 

 performed or a limit on power has been transgressed. With the High Court’s 

 original  jurisdiction  under  section  75(v)  and  the  Federal  Court’s  jurisdiction  

 under section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) there has to be identified a 

 “jurisdictional error”.8 With the Federal Court’s jurisdiction under the ADJR 

 there  has  to  be  made  out  one  of  the  grounds  in  sections  5  or  6  of  the  ADJR  

 which  in  turn  presupposes  that  there  was  some  form of  obligation  to  take  or  

 not  take  the  step  referred  to  in  those  provisions;  eg  to  take  into  account  a  

 particular  consideration  or  afford  procedural  fairness.  The  Courts  undertake  

 the  inquiry  into  the  existence  of  the  limit  on  power  by  applying  legal  

 technique but the source of the obligation on the decision matter or the limit 

 on  their  power  is  a  much  debated  question.   The  two  competing  schools  are  

 the  common  law  (except  as  expressly  displaced  by  statute)  or  the  legislation

 itself.9 There is also a deeper question as to whether the Constitution embodies 

 some  minimum  content  of  judicial  review  and,  if  so,  what?10   However  for  

 present purposes I need only identify the debate before moving on. 

 

 6. What is the rationale for judicial review, if any? The existence of a power in 

 the  High  Court  to  undertake  judicial  review  in  Australia  has  never  been  

 questioned and, given the terms of the Constitution it is difficult to see how it 

 could be questioned. For that reason I suppose there has been little reason for 

 the  Courts  to  debate  its  utility.   (Parliament  on  the  other  hand  appears  from  

 time  to  time  to  comment  upon  it  in  either  expanding  its  availability  or  

 curtailing  it).  To  the  extent  that  it  has  been  mentioned  in  the  cases  the  

 underlying rationale has been stated as the rule of law11 being that part of the 

 rule of law which is concerned with government under law. Balanced against 

 this  is  what  is  described  as  the  need  for  judicial  restraint  in  interfering  with  

 government  decisions.  Both  Chief  Justice  Gleeson  and  Chief  Justice  

 Spigelman have commented upon the balance that Courts need to undertake to 

 preserve “judicial legitimacy”.12 The point I make is that the rule of law and 

 judicial  legitimacy  being  the  measures  applied  to  Courts  are  a  very  different  

 set of yardsticks than those applied to Ombudsman and tribunals.13 As I will 

 discuss, it can be difficult to evaluate the criticisms of the Courts for failing to 

 preserve their “legitimacy”.  

 Some Features of Judicial Review 

 7. I would like to now identify four (by no means exclusive) features of judicial 

 review relevant to this topic and compare and contrast them with the position 

 of tribunals and the Ombudsman.

 12   Gleeson AM, “Judicial Legitimacy” (2000) 20 Aust Bar Rev 4; Spigelman, “The Integrity  Branch of Government” AIAL National Lecture Series on Administrative Law No 2 at p.13. 

 13   An empirical analysis of the practical effects of judicial review outcomes is to be found in   McMillan and Creyke “Judicial Review Outcomes - An empirical study” (2004) 11 AJ Admin L82.

 8. First, there is the constitutional independence of Federal Courts in conducting 

 review. As I have already stated, the High Court’s judicial review function is 

 constitutionally  entrenched.  While  that  is  not  the  case  for  other  Federal  

 Courts,14  to the extent they are given a judicial review function they cannot be 

 the subject of interference or direction in its exercise.15  In terms of “external 

 review” the Courts are the most external of all in that they are a separate and 

 independent arm of government. There are, of course, a number of provisions 

 in  various  pieces  of  legislation  which  offer  a  degree  of  institutional  

 independence to Tribunal members16 and the Ombudsman.17 However they do 

 have  offer  life  tenure,  they  are  often  required  to  comply  with  or  take  into  

 account  some  form  of  Ministerial  or  Departmental  direction  or  policy18  and  

 their tenure and terms can be altered by Parliament.   

 

 9. However,  at  another  level,  the  tenure  of  the  Court’s  judicial  review  function  

 can be fragile. If one of the measures applied to the Court’s performance is the 

 maintenance of “judicial legitimacy” then it can be a harsh standard when their 

 decision or processes frustrate others especially the executive. The charge they 

 have  gone  too  far  can  be  easily  made.  The  Courts  cannot  defend  themselves  

 against  the  charge  and  there  is  no  one  that  can  do  it  on  their  behalf.  If  

 criticisms are made of the Ombudsman then he or she can put their case both 

 to  the  public,  the  executive  and  to  Parliament.  The  position  is  not  quite  so  

 clear  with  Tribunals  but  I cannot see any reason why the head of a Tribunal 

 cannot  defend  either  the  institution  or  an  individual  decision  if  he  or  she  

 chooses. 

 

 10. Second, there is the point made by Justice Brennan in the quote from Quinn  

 namely that the role of the Court is not to consider the merits of the decision 

 but  the  legal  limits  on  the  person  or  body  who  made  it.  The  distinction  

 between merits and legality is at the heart of judicial review however it can be 

 hard to draw. Justice Brennan did not state that Courts were unconcerned with                                                   

 14   See Abebe v The Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510.  15   Chu Keng Lim v Minister for Immigration (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 36.  16

   see for example ss 7 and 13 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth)  17   See sections 22 and 28 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth).  18

   See for example s. 499 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and Drake and Minister for  Immigration (No 2) (1979) 2 ALD 634.

 the merits of an administrative decision per se only that they were immaterial 

 if  they  could  be  distinguished  from  a  consideration  of  its  legality.  In  my  

 experience when there is room for argument about what is the relevant legal 

 obligation  imposed  on  a  decision  maker,  an  analysis  of  some  aspect  of  the  

 “merits” of that decision inevitably intrudes.  

 

 11. Conversely  those  bodies  that  examine  the  merits  of  administrative  decisions,  

 i.e.  the  Ombudsman  and  tribunals,  will  often  consider  the  legality  of  the  

 decisions or practices they are examining.  Professor  McMillan  has  described  

 how his role as Ombudsman often requires him to review and advise upon the 

 legality of administrative action.  He describes this role as enhancing the rule 

 of law.19  Equally, one often sees how Tribunals tasked with determining the 

 correct and preferable decision have to first ask themselves what decisions are 

 legally permissible? However, allowing for the performance of those functions 

 by others, the task of determining conclusively the limits of the power of an 

 administrative decision maker is for the Courts alone to perform.20 

 

 12. Third, as the Court’s function is solely concerned with determining the legal 

 validity  of  the  decision  and,  as  that  is  to  be  ascertained  in  accordance  with  

 legal  method,  there  is  minimal  room  for  considering  the  type  of  issues  that  

 might arise if one was analysing  the  decision  from a  perspective  of  ensuring  

 good  or  efficient  administration.  In  construing  statutory  provisions  

 consideration  is  sometimes  given  as  to  what  might  be  involved  in  terms  of  

 convenience or potential cost in future cases if one construction or another is 

 adopted.21  However  there  is  never  any  empirical  analysis  of  this  nor  any  

 consideration  of  the  effect  of  invalidating  a  particular  decision  on  past  

 decisions  or  on  other  cases  (nor  am  I  saying  there  should  be).  Once  a  

 determination is made that the relevant legal limitation has been transgressed 

 the Court will not consider such matters as the cost or effect of compliance or 

 the  effect  on  other  decisions.   To  a  large  extent  this  observation  is  probably  

 true  of  tribunals  but  in  my  limited  experience  of  Ombudsman  these  are  the

 type of considerations that they will or  might  consider  in  their  dealings  with  

 Departments. 

 

 13. Fourth,  the  role  of  the  Courts  is  fundamentally  a  passive  one.   They  do  not  

 initiate  or  invite  judicial  review.  Their  function  is  limited  to  hearing  and  

 determining  applications  made  to  them. Tribunals are also limited to hearing 

 and determining the applications before them but many of them have an ability 

 to inquire beyond the arguments and materials presented to them.22 In contrast, 

 the Ombudsman may initiate inquiries into administrative action on his or her 

 own initiative and has a discretion not to investigate a complaint.23 The Courts 

 cannot close their doors and have to listen to everyone who comes in.  I will 

 discuss this constraint on courts further. I think it is often overlooked. 

 

 14. Against this background I wanted to spend a little time revisiting an influential 

 criticism of the Federal Court’s role in reviewing immigration decisions and, 

 in particular, the allegation that as an institution it systematically traversed the 

 merits/legality divide.  

 

 Criticism of the Federal Court 

 

 15. In 1999 the AIAL Forum published an article by Professor McMillan critical 

 of  the  Federal  Court’s  role  in  conducting  judicial  review  of  immigration  

 decisions.  It  was  entitled  “Federal  Court  v  Minister  for  Immigration.”24   A 

 number  of  articles  to  similar  effect  followed.25  The  article  received  a  great  

 deal  of  publicity  at  the  time  that  the  events  involving  the  “Tampa”  were  

 unfolding26  and  its  conclusions  were  discussed  in  the  print  and  electronic  

 

 22   See for example the description of the Refugee Review Tribunal as “inquisitorial” in Abebe  supra at [187] (per Gummow and Hayne JJ.) 

 23   Sub-section 8(1) of the Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth); S.8 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth)  deals with investigation and does not require a “complaint”.

 media.27 As far as I can know it is the only time that a discussion of a Court’s 

 role in judicial review has “cut through” to the mainstream of political debate 

 in the last 25 years.  

 

 16. In “Federal Court v Minister for Immigration” Professor McMillan reviewed 

 a number of decisions of the Federal Court which were later found either by 

 the High Court or a Full Court of the Federal Court itself to have crossed the 

 merits/legality divide. The article rejected the suggestion that this was merely 

 the operation of the “appellate process at work in the correction of legal error 

 at the trial level”. Instead it suggested that there was a “deeper” problem with 

 the Federal Court: 

 

 “…During  the  last  decade  of  judicial  review  by  the  Federal  Court,   there appears at any time in that period to be a principle or theme that  predominates  in  the  explanations  given  by  the  Court  as  to  why   immigration  decisions  are  invalid.  As  each  such  theme  is,  in  turn,   annulled either by legislative action or by appellate court review, it is  replaced  by  another  theme  that  delivers  the  similar  result  of   invalidity.”28    

 17. The article then traced the rise and fall of various grounds of judicial review 

 noting that the ground then in vogue in the Federal Court was the complaint 

 that  the  relevant  immigration  tribunal  had  not  properly  complied  with  its  

 obligation to set out the reasons for its decision.29 At a later point the article 

 summed up its central thesis as follows: 

 

   “…  the  present  system  of  administrative  review  of  refugee  

 determinations  is  inappropriate.  The  distortions  that  are  caused  by   judicial  overreach  are  inimical  not  only  to  immigration  adjudication,   but to administrative law generally and no doubt in the mind of some,  to  public  policy  in  the  operation  of  government  and  the  relationships   between the branches of government.” (emphasis added)   

  The article then repeats the proposition stated earlier: 

 

 27   Kelly supra; ABC Radio National “Asylum Seekers and the Courts: Our man in Kabul”  25/11/01; ABC 7.30 Report, 05/09/01.]  28

   McMillan, “Federal Court v Minister for Immigration” at p. 4.  29   McMillan supra at pp 5 to 7 

  8

   “The pattern of judicial overreach has been continuous, changing only  to shift ground from one legal principle to another… this pattern has  continued  despite  the  contrary  directions  of  the  High  Court  and  the   Parliament.”30 (emphasis added)   

 18. What “distortions”  were  said  by  the  article  to  be  caused  by  “judicial 

 overreach”? The relevant footnote cross refers to two other footnotes.31 One 

 stated that there had been a rise in the number of migration cases filed in the 

 Federal Court from 84 in 1987/1988 to 871 in 1998/1999.32 The other stated 

 that,  despite  the  success  rate  for  applications  for  judicial  review  of  

 immigration  decisions  remaining  at  around  10%33, “judicial  merits  review  

 [had]  arguably  been  a  factor  in  the  increase”  in  other  elements  of  the  

 litigation process namely the number of filings, the delay in dealing with cases 

 and  the  cost  to  the  Department  of  defending  them.  However  the  latter  two  

 matters are generally a function of the first and so the identified “distortion” 

 from “judicial  merits  review”  appears  to  be  a  greater  number  of  litigants  

 chancing their arm and filing applications. 

 

 19. I  remember  reading  that  article  and  having  some  personal  views  on  these  

 conclusions given that I spent a little bit of time in the system that was being 

 scrutinised.  As  I  read  the  article,  I  understood  that  it  was  not  merely  taking  

 issue with the particular decisions of particular judges but was instead making 

 a claim against the Federal Court as an institution as a whole (‘Federal Court 

 v  Minister  for  Immigration”;  “pattern  of  judicial  overreach”  etc).  This  was  

 what was conveyed in media reports.34  

 

 20. With the benefit of hindsight the article’s two critical conclusions namely that 

 the existence of an institutional agenda on the part of the Federal Court and the 

 “distorting effect’ of that agenda can be revisited.

 21. The  notion  of  the  Federal  Court  having  an  agenda  to  invalidate  immigration  

 decisions and then being corrected by High Court has had an interesting time 

 since. If you accept the article’s premise, and you may have guessed that I do 

 not, then the High Court has turned from gamekeeper to poacher.  

 

 22. The  criticism  of  the  Federal  Court  for  reviewing  decisions  based  on  the  

 inadequacy of the written reasons had a good start in May 2001 when the High 

 Court decided Yusuf35 and swept away that ground of review. However, Yusuf 

 also interpreted the former Part 8 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) as allowing 

 judicial  review  for  an  extended  concept  of  jurisdictional  error  that  was  very  

 much to the same effect.36  In October 2001 a Hickman37 style privative clause 

 was  inserted  into  the  Migration  Act.38   In  August  2002  a  five  member  Full  

 Court  of  the  Federal  Court  decided  NAAV.39  In  doing  so  they  construed  the  

 privative  clause  fairly  widely  leaving  very  little  scope  for  judicial  review.  

 However six months later the High Court decided Plaintiff S15740 holding that 

 it did not protect immigration decisions from “jurisdictional error”. A number 

 of  cases  have  confirmed  that  most  forms  of  legal  error  on  the  part  of  an  

 administrative tribunal are “jurisdictional”41. A non jurisdictional error of law 

 on the part of an administrative tribunal is a very rare species.42 

 

 23. Plaintiff  S157  radically  altered  the  perceptions  of  many  as  to  the  form  of  

 judicial  review  that  was  thought  to  be  available  after  the  enactment  of  the  

 privative  clause.  It  all  but  destroyed  the  practical  effect  of  a  number  of  time  

 limits imposed on applications for judicial review of immigration decisions at 

 the  same  time.43   Since  Plaintiff  S157  there  has  been  what  I  might  call  the  

 

 35   MIMA v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323  36   Whereas prior to Yusuf decisions were reviewed for failing to record in the reasons a finding 

 on a “material question of fact” after Yusuf the failure to record the finding was a basis for  inferring that it was not made and therefore the relevant tribunal did not compete its exercise  of jurisdiction:  37

   R v Hickman; ex parte Fox (1945) 70 CLR 598  38   By Act 134 of 2001. 

 39   NAAV v MIMA (2001) 123 FCR 298  40   Plaintiff S157/2002 v the Commonwealth (2002) 211 CLR 476  41

   Yusuf supra (which was decided prior to Plaintiff S157); see SAAP v MIMA (2005) 79 ALJR  1009; MIMA v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [35] to [57] (per Gummow and Hayne JJ).  42   An example being a contravention of sub-section 418(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) is to  be found in Muin supra at [21] (per Gleeson CJ) and at [46] (per Gaudron J)  43

 usual  ebb  and  flow  between  the  Federal  Court  and  the  High  Court.  The  

 Federal  Court  has  been  grappling  with  the  proper  interpretation  of  statutory  

 provisions  codifying  the  rules  of  procedural  fairness.44  The  High  Court  has  

 been  strongly  protective  of  what  is  required  by  procedural  fairness45  and  

 insistent on complete compliance with its statutory equivalents.46  

 

 24. From  the  time  the  High  Court  decided  Eshetu47  in  1999  until  its  decision  in  

 Plaintiff  S157  in  2003  there  were  no  changes  in  its  composition.48  The  five  

 member  Full  Court  that  decided  NAAV  had  been  with  the  Federal  Court  

 throughout the entire period identified in Professor McMillan’s article.49 

 

 25. The  only  conclusions  that  I  would  form  from  this  are  negative  ones.  In  the  

 years  after  1999  there  has  not  been  any  trend  of  decisions  suggesting  an  

 agenda  in  the  Federal  Court  to  invalidate  immigration  decisions  and,  if  

 anything,  it  has  been  less  inclined  to  find  invalidating  error  than  the  High  

 Court. I also think this throws light on the prior period considered in Professor 

 McMillan’s  article.  In  1994  Parliament  ceased  to  apply  the  ADJR  to  

 immigration decisions and instead created a truncated judicial review scheme 

 for the Federal Court.  The High Court’s original jurisdiction was untouched.50 

 When this change was combined with a large increase in the number of cases 

 and  numerous  changes  to  other  parts  of  the  Migration  Act  it  meant  that  the  

 Federal Court was adapting to a very different judicial review environment at 

 the same time as it received a heavy increase in its workload.  

 

 26. In  my  view  the  period  from  1994  up  to  Plaintiff  S157  should  not  be  seen  as  

 involving  systemic  blasphemy  by  the  Federal  Court  but  a  reconsideration  of

 the  underlying  principles  of  judicial  review  by  the  Courts  generally.   If  you  

 walked into an administrative law pet shop in 1995 the local galah was talking 

 about “grounds  of  review”.   If  you  walked  in  to  the  same  shop  in  2004  the  

 same  bird  was  squawking  “jurisdictional  error”.  There  was  and  is  always  

 scope  for  criticism  of  individual  judgments,  individual  judges,  judicial  delay  

 and particular doctrine but the “agenda claim” against the Federal Court as an 

 institution  was  and  is  not  supportable.   The  Federal  Court  bore  the  brunt  of  

 changes on a number of fronts: substantive, procedural and quantity. It worked 

 through them as best it could. 

 

 27. What can the subsequent years tell us about the alleged “distortions” resulting 

 from  the  Federal  Courts  so  called  “judicial  overreach”?    As  a  matter  of  

 principle  I  had  difficulty  seeing  why  an  increase  in  filings  was  necessarily  

 seen  to  be  a  “distortion”.  An  increase  in  filings  especially  among  a  group  

 who  were  generally  under-resourced  might  be  seen  as  the  Courts  ensuring  

 access to justice and enhancing the rule of law.  At a factual level I was always 

 dubious that the scores of unrepresented litigants who rolled in to the Federal 

 Court were pouring over the fate of the ground of review that was flavour of 

 the  month.  I  suspected  that  they  were  often  litigants  with  little  to  lose  from  

 undertaking  the  last  roll  of  the  dice.  If  there  was  an  avenue  of  review  open  

 they would take it.  

 

 28. Overall, it seemed to me that no solid conclusions could be formed unless the 

 data was interrogated further to find out why the applications were being filed 

 and whether the increases were related to any underlying policy or legislative 

 changes. Were there higher refusals of on shore applicants in this time? Were 

 the criteria for making the decisions radically changed or tightened? I had not 

 done that analysis and none was mentioned in the article. 

 

 29. In any event, if the number of filings is said to be the guide then the Federal 

 Courts’  alleged  “judicial  overreach”  did  not  have  the  causal  affect  that  was  

 suggested  in  Professor  McMillan’s  article.  The  article  noted  that  there  were  

  12

 871  filings  in  the  Federal  Court  in  1998/1999.51  According  to  the  Federal  

 Court’s annual reports there were 967 in 1999/2000 and 1343 in 2000/2001. In 

 October 2001 the Federal Magistrates Court acquired a jurisdiction to review 

 immigration  decisions.  The  combined  figure  for  the  Federal  Court  and  the  

 Federal  Magistrates  Court  in  2001/2002  was  1563,  the  combined  figure  for  

 2002/2003  was  3231  and  the  combined  figure  for  2003/2004  was  5637.52 

 Those latter two figures are boosted by a large number of remittals from the 

 High  Court  to  the  Federal  Court  and  I  suspect  that  combining  both  Court’s  

 figures might involve some doubling up because of referrals from the Federal 

 Court to the Federal Magistrates Court.  

 

 30. I do not suggest that these figures can be taken very far. I suspect but do not 

 know  that  the  increase  in  filings  that  followed  Plaintiff  S157  may  have  been  

 because of the effect of the case on time limits or it may have been because a 

 wider scope of review became available or both.  However the figures for the 

 number  of  filings  in  the  period  prior  to  Plaintiff  S157  are  revealing.  The  

 figures for the years 2001/2002 to 2002/2003 include the period from October 

 2001  to  February  2003  when  there  was  in  force  a  privative  clause  that  was  

 understood  by  many  to  oust  almost  all  judicial  review.  Those  figures  are  

 significantly higher than the figures for the number of filings in the latter part 

 of the 1990’s which were the subject of Professor McMillan’s article. This is 

 inconsistent with his assertion that any agenda on the part of the Federal Court 

 to invalidate decisions was leading to “distortions” in the sense of an increase 

 

 51   McMillan supra at footnote 1. The Federal Court’s annual report for 2003 states that the  number for that year was 941. 

 52   With  effect  from  October  2001  the  Federal  Magistrates  Court  acquired  a  jurisdiction  to   undertake judicial review of migration decisions. According to its annual reports the number  of such applications filed in that year and following years were: 2001/2002 : 182; 2002/2003 : 

 1397 (Annual Report for 2002/2003 at p. 20); 2003/2004: 3046; 2004/2005 2445; 2005/2006:  2429 (Annual report for 2005/2006 at p. 22).   

 For  the  Federal  Court  the  number  of  applications  filed  was:  1997/98  :  659;  1998/99:  941;   1999/2000:  967;  2000/2001:  1343;  2001/2002:  1381;  (Federal  Court  annual  report  for   2002/2003;  Appendix  7,  figure  5.8);  2002/2003:  1836;  (boosted  by  637  remittals  from  the   High  Court);  2003/2004  :  2591;  (boosted  by  1716  remittals  from  the  High  Court);  (Federal   Court annual report for 2003/2004; Appendix 5, figure 5.8).   

 The  combined  totals  for  these  years  are:  1997/1998:  659;  1998/1999:  941;  1999/2000:  967;   2000/2001: 1343; 2001/2002: 1563; 2002/2003: 3233; 2003/2004: 5637;

 in  court  filings.  The  available  evidence  suggests  that  in  the  period  from  

 October 2001 to February 2003 the number of filings kept increasing despite 

 the attempt to dramatically narrow the scope of judicial review. 

 

 31. This  brings  me  back  to  the  fourth  aspect  of  the  role  of  Courts  and  judicial  

 review that I identified earlier. The duty of the Federal Court is to decide cases 

 that  are  brought  to  it  to  determine.  The  nature  of  its  function  in  determining  

 the  law  is  adversarial  in  that  it  must  adjudicate  on  the  issues  raised  by  the  

 parties  before  it.  The  fact  that  over  the  last  twenty  years  various  grounds  of  

 review  have  risen  and  then  fallen  only  to  be  superseded  by  new  ones  is  not  

 surprising.  One  would  expect  that  to  occur  as  one  avenue  of  argument  is  

 closed off by a higher court decision or legislative change or corrective action 

 by  decision  makers.  However  it  is  not  the  Court  but  the  remaining  litigants  

 who  then  seek  to  argue  new  grounds  or  focus  attention  on  existing  grounds  

 that  have  not  been  considered  in  much  detail.   For  example,  the  ground  of  

 review  that  was  based  on  the  inadequacy  of  the  written  reasons  that  was  

 criticised in Professor McMillan’s article had its origins in decisions that had 

 nothing to do with immigration.53  What was different about the late 1990’s to 

 the prior period was that instead of the ground only being argued a couple of 

 times  a  year  under  the  ADJR  it  was  being  argued  a  couple  of  times  a  day  

 under the former Part 8 of the Migration Act.  When this process of focusing 

 attention on new grounds is mixed with an explosion in the number of cases in 

 one  area  before  the  Court  then  it  might  appear  to  some  that  the  Court,  in  

 responding  to  the  cases  before  it  and  the  arguments  made,  is  somehow  

 endorsing  that  process.  It  is  not.   It  is  merely  performing  its  duty  within  the  

 constraints imposed on it.  

 

 32. With  the  benefit  of  another  eight  years  since  the  publication  of  Professor  

 McMillan’s  article  the  large  volume  of  largely  unsuccessful  migration  

 litigation looks more like the playing out of an interaction between underlying 

 social forces and various policy and legislative changes with some of the latter                                                   

 53   See Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465; Dornan v  Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564; Rich Rivers Radio Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  (1989) 22 FCR 437 Commonwealth v Pharmacy Guild of Australia (1989) 91 ALR 65, cited

 being  unsuccessful  in  achieving  their  aims.  The  changing  fortunes  of  the  

 Federal  Court’s  various  doctrines  and  its  fundamentally  passive  role  in  

 determining the cases brought to it by others appears to be a bit of sideshow in 

 that  interplay.  I  think  we  should  all  bear  that  in  mind  as  we  contemplate  the  

 impact  of  external  administrative  review  by  the  Courts  on  immigration  

 decisions  and,  if  the  events  are  repeated  elsewhere,  on  other  administrative  

 decisions.
