  NEW INITIATIVES FOR F Al\ULIES OF HUMANITARIAN ENTRANTS 

  The Australian Government is to make it .easier for refugees and other humanitarian  entrants to bring their families to Australia . 

  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus announced today  that measures will be introduced to ensure that those family members seeking to reunite  with their immediate families in Australia will be given the same benefits as those they  are seeking to join. This will include the dropping of Migration fees normally payable to  bring separated families together. 

  The concession will apply where at least one member of the family in Australia was  granted either a Protection visa after arrival in Australia, or was resettled under  Australia's Humanitarian Program. 

  Many people in these groups have brought their immediate family members to Australia  through the preferential family category, paying the usual application and processing fees  and missing some of the other benefits of entering under the Humanitarian Program. 

  "The Government has recognised that in some cases these costs have been a barrier which  has delayed their reunion, and has decided to remove that barrier," Senator Bolkus said. 

  "Members of families who have been separated by civil disturbances or other inhumane  experiences beyond their control should be able to join their immediate family in  Australia with the minimum amount of inconvenience and cost, as quickly as possible". 

  Senator Bolkus said it was intended to introduce tbe changes during the course of the  Government's 1996/97 Migration and Humanitarian Programs. The precise date for the  start of the concession will be announced when necessary legislation and regulation â‘  changes are made. 

  "The changes are a positive move the Government can make to affirm its recognition of  the special needs of people who find themselves without a base in their home country,  through no fault of their own. Reuniting such families can only help their settlement into  new lives, in a new country, in the Australian community. 

  "It is also a reaffirmation that family reunion remains a priority of the Government's  Migration and Humanitarian Programs," Senator Bolkus said.
