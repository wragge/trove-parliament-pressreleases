 Introduction   

 I would like to thank Robert McClelland for inviting me to join you tonight.   

 It is good to be among real people after a week in the weird and distorted world that is  our national parliament.   

 It is a world where a government that gives a terrorist a tourist visa to come to  Australia wants to be lauded for being strong on national security.  Fortunately,  Robert McClelland was there to expose that particular hypocrisy.   

 It is a world in which a government that downscales coastal surveillance around an  island that the Minister for Immigration describes as a ‘convenient dropping off  point’, then wants to politically profit from a boat arriving.    

 It is a world in which the Treasurer thinks he can make you believe paying more on  your huge Sydney mortgages is good economic news.   

 And it’s a world in which John Howard, the man who has devoted his political life to  destroying Medicare, now says he is a great supporter of it and the rules prevent you  from simply calling him what he should be called - a liar.  And if he wants to sue me  for being that direct I would imagine there are a number of lawyers in this room who  would relish the challenge of prosecuting the case in a court of a law!   

 It’s a world with all the weirdness, but none of the charm, of the County of the Land  of Oz.  Indeed, John Howard would be a great starter for the role of the Wizard of Oz,  a man who many believe has the power to accomplish almost anything, but who turns  out to be a charlatan.  Remember how in the movie, the Wizard first appears as a  figure of awe but is exposed by Dorothy and Toto as nothing but a pathetic,  shambling, gutless, lying, greying old bully yelling empty threats down a hidden  microphone.   

 And Peter Costello would have to be the standout for the role of the Cowardly Lion.   The man who believes he would be a better Prime Minister than the incumbent but  lacks the courage to act.   

 And Phillip Ruddock would be the Tin Man, the man without a heart.     

 And the backbench could all take turns being the Scarecrow, lacking the brains to  realise that you can’t deal with the issue that matters to people, the future of  Medicare, by putting in charge of it a man known as a boxer, a hard man, an attack  dog.  A man who has distinguished himself in the last week by denying the  government had any role in ensuring bulkbilling and by saying that was a matter  between a doctor and a patient.   

 And a man who showed just out of touch he was by responding to a question about a  war widow, on a pension, with a son on a disability pension who has lost 35kg in  weight because he just can’t eat and because the Howard Government ripped $100  million out of public dentistry he can’t get the care he needs.  Boxing Tony’s answer  was that they should get private health insurance.  Two pensioners with a combined 

  3

 weekly income of $476, should buy a health insurance product that would cost them  $32 a month with a gap payment of $800.  Absurd and cruel.    

 John Howard’s American Dream   

 Before the last sitting week, Parliament sat especially for the purpose of watching  John Howard look as excited as a kid in a sweet shop over having President George  W Bush address our Parliament.   

 We know why he was so excited.  It wasn’t over the prospect of a Free Trade deal or  new defence arrangements with the U.S.   

 It’s not just cheap software or expensive pharmaceuticals John Howard wants to  import from George Bush.   

 He wants to import the American Republicans’ politics, values and society.   

 It’s interesting to look at what John Howard said to George Bush in the Parliament  before his address.  People have overlooked his actual words:   

 The things that unite the Australian and American people are shared values:  the belief that the individual is more important than the state, that strong  families are a nation's greatest asset, that competitive free enterprise is the  ultimate foundation of national wealth, and that the worth of a person is  determined by that person's character and hard work, not by their religion or  race or colour or creed or social background.   

 They may be the values of the United States, and we may share them in part, but  they’re not the things I think of when I think about Australia’s values.   

 Where are the references to mateship, the fair go, looking after each other?  Where are  the references to strong public services?  To opportunity?  To a nation-building role  for Government?   

 They were missing because deep down John Howard just doesn’t believe in them.   

 There are many great things to admire in the United States, but Australia is different.   And John Howard just can’t see it.   

 The fact is, John Howard wants to Americanise our whole society.   

 We’ve seen already how he has successfully imported to Australia the nastier  elements of American politics.     

 The dogwhistle wedge politics we saw at the last election was lifted straight off the  shelf from George Bush’s senior political strategist, Karl Rove.   

 But John Howard also wants to kick away the unique, egalitarian society that we’ve  created here in Australia.   

  4

 He constantly wraps himself in the flag, but at heart he doesn’t likethe sort of place  Australia turned out to be - the country of the fair go.   

 He wants to make us a country we won’t be able to recognise just a few years from  now - the country where you sink or swim.   

 And it all starts with importing the Republican idea of the role of government.   

 Like the Bush Republicans, the Howard Liberals are dedicated to rolling back the  great social gains of the 20th Century.   

 Fundamentally they want government to get out of the way so that the market can  take care of everything.   

 They oppose the whole idea of government itself.  They seek power in order to  dismantle government.   They believe that: "Government is the problem!"   

 We in Labor believe that Government should be part of the solution.   

 The Future of Health under Howard   

 Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in health - where John Howard’s American-style philosophy of government is a recipe for the unravelling of all of the values we  hold so dear here in Australia.   

 A recent book by the American writer Barbara Ehrenreich - Nickled and Dimed -  carries a timely warning for us if we go down the American route - especially in  health policy.   

 In it she describes the life of the low-paid in America, where you only qualify for the  equivalent of bulk billing if you’re actually on welfare.     

 Working families - even the very low paid - have to pay for expensive private health  insurance.     

 Sound familiar?   

 As a result 45 million Americans now go without any health cover at all.   

 Just like they did here in Australia before the Whitlam Government gave us  Medibank.   

 And just like they did again after the Fraser Government destroyed it.   

 Barbara Ehrenreich makes the point that these people live in constant fear of illness.     

 They have missing teeth.     

 They go without drugs.     

  5

 They don’t treat illnesses early and end up much sicker, or worse.     

 Pain, she tells us, is something that working Americans ‘have to get through’.   

 A consultation with a GP can cost $150.   

 Essential drugs that are available free here on the PBS can cost hundreds, and even  thousands of dollars.   

 Imagine a society where single parents have to work 2 jobs so they can afford private  medical cover.   

 That’s the sort of society John Howard will create by destroying Medicare.   

 And despite all this, it’s a society that spends 50 percent more of its GDP on health  care than we do.   

 It’s the sort of health system we can’t afford, don’t want and don’t need to have.   

 That’s why Labor’s going to save Medicare.   

 It’s an absolutely essential part of the fairer society we want to save here in Australia.   

 Without Medicare there is no fair go.  Without Medicare there is no security for  families, and no easygoing Australian way of life.   

 So the choice at the next election is simple: a vote for Labor is a vote to save  Medicare, and a vote for the Liberals is a vote to destroy it.   

 Never forget what John Howard really believes about Medicare.  During the 1980s he  campaigned against it, saying he wanted to pull it right apart, and he described bulk  billing as a rort.    

 He’s now appointed his attack dog, Tony Abbott, to kill Medicare.   

 He says he appointed Abbott to ‘fix’ Medicare.  He’ll fix it all right.  Just like he  ‘fixed’ the unions and Peter Reith ‘fixed’ the waterfront.   

 Of course John Howard and Tony Abbott are about to engage in a dishonest campaign  to convince the Australian people that they really do care about Medicare.   

 To save their electoral hide, they’re going to roll the pork barrel down the main street  of every marginal seat in the country and ladle out the lies and the false hope.   

 Just like they did about our universities before the last election.  They told us there  was no crisis.  They offered illusory cash.  And then, after the election they slugged  our children with higher debts and higher fees.   

 Using what happened to our universities as an example, let me make a prediction  about what will happen over the next few months. 

  6

 

 In the lead up to the election, they will tell us that there’s no crisis in our health  system. They’ll tell us that the system’s fine.  That while bulk billing levels may have  fallen, they’re still OK and, anyway, the system was never meant to be universal.   

 Then ‘to make Medicare even fairer and stronger’ they’ll hand out bogus incentives to  doctors to bulk bill, pledge to put extra resources in health hotspots, invent new safety  net arrangements and come up with all sorts of new IT plans to supposedly streamline  the health system.    

 And almost every dollar will be targeted at vulnerable marginal seats.   

 Of course, after the election the story will suddenly change.   

 Tony Abbott will tell us that he’s received new figures.   

 We’ll be told that, in fact, the health system is in crisis, and that, surprise, surprise,  drastic reforms will be needed to pay to fund the necessary changes.   

 What will be on the agenda then?   

 â¢ The end of bulk billing;  â¢ Pressure on the States to charge fees for public hospitals; and  â¢ Provision for people with private insurance to opt out of the Medicare Levy.   

 In other words - the American-style health care system John Howard has always  wanted.  The health system he gave us as Malcolm Fraser’s Treasurer.  And the health  system in which only the very rich and the very poor can afford to get sick.   

 Friends, when you hear those sweet words from the new, kinder, gentler, softer Tony  Abbott, don’t believe them.     

 Don’t believe the man who himself said you can’t trust politicians.  Don’t believe the  man who set up Australians for Honest Politics and then lied about it.    

 Tony Abbott is John Howard’s pet, his pet attack dog.   

 And like John Howard, he wants to rip Medicare apart and let the market take over.   

 That is not the sort of health system a civilised society should ever condone.   

 

 LABOR’S PLAN TO SAVE MEDICARE   

 Labor has a real, fully-costed, $1.9 billion plan to save Medicare.     

 It starts with rescuing bulk billing.   

  7

 Every Australian should have the right to see a doctor or attend a public hospital  without charge.  I won’t say for free - because it’s not free.  Australians have already  paid for it with their Medicare Levy and their taxes.     

 To save bulk billing, we will lift the patient rebate for bulk billing for all  Australians, no matter where they live, or how much they earn.   

 Recently I announced that to give families access to bulk billing and relieve  pressure on our public hospitals, Labor will send up to 100 teams of GPs and  nurses to communities where bulk billing rates are low. 

 

 But we must do more.   

 Our task is nothing less than to save Medicare itself.   

 It’s true that times have changed since Medicare was introduced.     

 Our health system is much more complex, and much more expensive than it was  when as ‘Medibank’ it was first introduced nearly thirty years ago.   

 To strengthen it we must modernise it.   

 But we must never undermine Medicare’s fundamental principle - universality.   

 Real reform of Medicare will take a national effort of cooperation between the states  and the Commonwealth.   

 The argument between the state and federal governments over who is responsible for  the state of our health system must be leaving all Australians feeling cold.     

 They don’t care that it’s the federal government that funds the doctors, the states that  fund hospitals and the federal government that funds aged care.   

 All they know is they pay their taxes, they pay their Medicare levy and they want  access to a hospital bed, a doctor who bulk bills and aged care for their grandparents.   

 They want an end to the buckpassing and the blame shifting.  They want cooperation.   

 And the possibility of Labor Governments in every state, both the territories and in  Canberra - for the first time in our nation’s history - gives us the chance to achieve  that cooperation.   

 I have signalled that one of the first acts of a Crean Labor Government will be  the establishment of a new National Health Reform Commission to drive the  reform process.   

 It will bring together all the major players including the Commonwealth, all State and  Territory Governments, the heads of major statutory authorities, a representative  group of managers from major public hospitals and health services, consumers,  doctors and other health professionals, health unions and the private health sector.

 And its findings will start to be implemented within 12 months of Labor taking office.   

 

 CONCLUSION   

 At the coming federal election we have a choice.   

 A choice between a dishonest political fix for Medicare, or a plan to save Medicare.   

 A choice between a party that believes in using government to benefit the whole of  society, and a party that wants to destroy government to let the market run everything.   

 This choice makes the next election the most important election in the last three  decades.  It will determine what sort of society we want to be.   

 A country that continues to live out its promise as the country of the fair go, or a  country, like America, where you sink or swim.   

 I trust the good sense of the Australian people.   

 That’s why I think John Howard should be worried.   

 And why Labor can win the next election.
