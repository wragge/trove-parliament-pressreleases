  JOHN HOWARD’S MULTICULTURAL PARADOX 1 

  

  As I write, multiculturalism is once again in the h eadlines, this time courtesy of 

  comments by Treasurer Peter Costello who last week lashed out at ‘mushy 

  multiculturalism’ and warned that migrants who did not share Australian values 

  should be stripped of their citizenship’ ( Age  24 February 2006). Costello’s claims 

  come at a time when Australians are still coming to  terms with the ugly riots that took 

  place in Sydney before Christmas, when approximately 5000 young ‘Australians’ 

  swarmed to Cronulla beach in the city’s south-east,  with the express intention of 

  reclaiming the beach from ‘lebs’ and ‘wogs’. Fuelle d by drink, sunshine and a 

  distorted form of racial-nationalist pride, the pro test turned into a fully-fledged riot, 

  flag-draped demonstrators turning violently on peop le of Middle Eastern appearance 

  and those that tried to help them, including police  and ambulance officers. At least ten 

  people were injured and scores of others arrested. The events led, in turn, to a spate of 

  violent reprisal attacks by young Lebanese-Australi an men, forcing the police to 

  lockdown certain sections of the city. Despite some  return to normality, Sydney today 

  remains in a state of alert, with fears of further attacks and rioting.    

  

  For social commentators on the progressive-left, th e distressing events at Cronulla, 

  and Costello’s recent foray into the politics of im migration, come as no surprise. They 

  have interpreted them as the culmination of the cou ntry’s retreat from progressive, 

  anti-racist, multicultural attitudes and institutio ns since the Howard government 

  assumed power ten years ago. They highlight numerous examples of Howard’s and 

  his supporters willingness to ‘play the race card’ for political advantage since 1996.  

  

  Not surprisingly, the Howard government has consistently rejected claims that it is 

  anti-immigration, anti-immigrant, or even anti-mult icultural. Its main concern, it 

  stresses, is to give more emphasis to the notion of  ‘core’ Australian values. It urges 

  the need for a strong, coherent and unambiguous res ponse to the various forces that 

  threaten social stability at the present time, incl uding ethnic tribalism, religious 

  fundamentalism and terrorism. It highlights the str ong support the government’s 

  approach enjoys amongst ‘mainstream’ Australians.

  Which view is correct? Has the Howard government killed off Australian 

  multiculturalism? Should it? Are its personal and p olitical interests, and a racist 

  undercurrent in Australia, returning the country to  the assimilationist policies of the 

  pre-Whitlam era of the 1960s? Or are its attitudes and policy approaches â and public 

  opinion generally â more complex?   

  

  Such questions have received significant attention from political pundits during the 

  past decade. Yet the quantity of commentary has not  always been synonymous with 

  quality. Constructed in the context of the highly p olarised, ideologically-charged 

  debate on immigration, race and national identity t hat has been the backdrop to the 

  Howard years, much public discourse has tended to be partisan, emotive and 

  rhetorically-driven, rather than analytic and histo rically and conceptually precise. This 

  has tended to obscure and confuse some very fundamental issues, like what 

  multiculturalism is, and how it functions as an asp ect of Australian immigrant 

  settlement policy (as opposed to its place in the h istory and politics of national 

  identity, or its role in the political contest betw een Labor and the Liberals). It has also 

  distracted attention from other important considera tions, for example, the success or 

  otherwise of Australia’s migrant settlement model, and its continuing relevance in the 

  21 st  century.       

  

  This paper seeks to clarify some of this confusion in the course of assessing how 

  Australian multiculturalism is doing after almost t en years of social conservative, neo-liberal rule under Howard. It examines the current government’s approach in the 

  context of multiculturalism’s always highly contest ed, highly politicized history, and 

  its dual identity as both a public policy program a nd an ideology. It identifies the 

  various, sometimes conflicting, interests and value s that have shaped both former and 

  current government approaches, and the extent to wh ich policies have changed over 

  time. It considers multiculturalism’s future in the  face of current perceived threats to 

  national sovereignty and identity.

  The political dynamics of Australian multiculturali sm  

  Nearly all modern, liberal-democracies are multicul tural nowadays, though all in 

  different ways. Despite its recent troubled record on race and ethnic relations, 

  Australia has long been regarded as an important in novator in multicultural policy, 

  with its strong institutional approach to migrant s ettlement, protection of ethnic rights 

  and management of cultural diversity. This manifest ed itself in the introduction of an 

  impressive array of programs and policies during th e late 1960s and throughout the 

  1970s, amongst them a grants-in-aid system to deliv er welfare and services to 

  migrants through ethnic organisations, expanded English language services, a 

  comprehensive Translator and Interpreter Service, migrant resource centres, the 

  creation of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils (a government-funded 

  umbrella organisation for the state-based Ethnic Co mmunities Councils), the 

  multicultural, multilingual Special Broadcasting Se rvice in radio and television, and 

  the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs ( AIMA) which conducted research on 

  multicultural affairs, provided advice to governmen t, and information and education 

  to the general public.   

  

  Australian multiculturalism developed primarily as a response to the perceived failure 

  of post-war assimilation policies to ensure the int egration of immigrants, especially 

  those of non-English speaking background (Jupp 2002, Lopez 2000; Tavan 1997). It 

  has always maintained this pragmatic emphasis on integrating new migrants into the 

  host society. As Jupp (2002, p.93) suggests, Austra lian multiculturalism is best 

  understood as a component of immigration settlement policy, not primarily a cultural 

  maintenance or cultural relativist policy as is the  case in countries like Canada. 

  Neither has it embodied a structural pluralist visi on of society, as far as government 

  policies and principles have been concerned. While political and community leaders 

  early conceded the right of ethnic groups to preser ve and develop their cultural 

  distinctiveness, and to take responsibility for the  delivery of migrant services and 

  welfare, this has generally been in the context of an assumed adherence to Australian 

  values and institutions. Lopez (2000, p. 447) corre ctly summarises ‘cultural 

  pluralism’ as one of the most significant tradition s in Australian multicultural thinking 

  and practice, with its conceptualisation of ‘an eth nically and culturally diverse 

  society, existing within a unified state, where mos t of the existing ‘core institutions’ 

  and ‘core values’ of the host society are preserved ’. An ‘ethnic rights’ model has also 

   4 

  been popular, with its emphasis on developing an et hnic consciousness amongst 

  migrants as the basis for sustained political mobil isation.             

  

  Despite many positive innovations, multiculturalism  has always been a politically 

  sensitive doctrine and policy program, vulnerable t o the conflicting demands of 

  sectional interests, shifting historical circumstan ces, and the source of considerable 

  public anxiety. ‘Mainstream’ Anglo opinion in parti cular has tended to be more 

  sceptical, concerned that the emphasis on cultural diversity and funding of ethnic 

  organisations is at the expense of Australian natio nal identity, that it gives 

  disproportionate political influence to ethnic comm unity leaders, and that it is costly 

  to the Australian taxpayer.  

  

  The first real sign of trouble manifested itself in  the early 1980s when esteemed 

  historian and public intellectual Professor Geoffre y Blainey argued that 

  multiculturalism was fomenting ‘a nation of tribes’  (Blainey 1984; Markus and 

  Ricklefs 1985). Various other conservative commentators and political leaders during 

  that decade echoed Blainey, including several members of the Liberal Party of 

  Australia and John Howard in his capacity as leader  of that party. In 1988, the 

  Fitzgerald Committee, a government-commissioned inquiry into immigration, noted 

  considerable public confusion and resentment about various aspects of policy, 

  including Asian immigration and multiculturalism, many viewing the latter as ‘social 

  engineering which actually invites injustice, inequ ality and divisiveness’ (CAAIP 

  1988, p. 3). That year too, sociologist Katherine B etts published a book, Ideology and 

  Immigration , which argued that popular opinion did not support  immigration and 

  multiculturalism, but that debate on this sensitive  issue was being stifled by 

  Australia’s intellectual and political elites, most  whom supported immigration and 

  multiculturalism in order to distinguish themselves  from what they considered to be a 

  highly parochial culture (Betts 1988).   

  

  Partly in response to these criticisms, but reflect ing other imperatives as well, 

  including the influence of neo-liberalism and chang ing economic circumstances, 

  successive governments since the 1980s have worked hard to reassert ‘a culture of 

  control’ over immigration matters and appease popular sentiment, even as they have 

  remained committed to large immigration intakes and the principles of cultural 

   5 

  pluralism and non-racial discrimination. This has b een expressed in various ways, 

  including an increasing emphasis on economic immigration, cuts to migrant spending, 

  a harsher attitude towards unauthorized asylum-seek ers, and a shift from a 

  discretionary model of decision-making in immigration to a more rules-based system 

  (Tavan 2005, p. 221; Jupp 2002, various chapters).  

  

  Multicultural policy has also undergone important c hanges. The Hawke Labor 

  government implemented significant cuts to programs in the mid-1980s, including the 

  abolition of the well-regarded AIMA. However, considerable pressure from ethnic 

  groups led to a re-appraisal of its approach. In 19 89 it introduced the National Agenda 

  for a Multicultural Australia . This was characterised by a shifting emphasis awa y 

  from migrant needs and entitlements, to an insisten ce on the rights of all  Australians 

  to express their cultural identity and access multi culturalism; also its attempts to 

  balance social democratic ideals of justice and equ ity for migrants with a neo-liberal 

  commitment to economic efficiency. It represented i n effect, a shift from an ethnic 

  rights to a ‘citizenship model’ of multiculturalism ; acknowledging cultural diversity 

  as an integral component of Australian society, and  freedom to express one’s cultural 

  heritage as a fundamental human right, but limiting  that pluralism through the 

  requirement of ‘an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia’ and acceptance 

  of ‘the basic structures and principles of Australi an society’ (National Agenda 1989; 

  Castles 2001, p.809).   

  

  In practical terms, the Hawke-Keating Labor years o f 1986-1996 were characterized 

  by the expansion of multicultural programs. This in cluded the establishment of the 

  Office of Multicultural Affairs to promote multicul tural policies and monitor 

  government programs, and the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population 

  Research (BIMPR) to provide research and information to policy-makers. Ideas like 

  ‘Productive Diversity’ were propagated in order to emphasise the economic benefits 

  of immigration and cultural pluralism in a rapidly globalising world. Consultative 

  relations with ethnic organisations were also reinf orced.  

  

  Strong efforts were also made to develop multicultu ralism as a nationalist ideology, 

  with public political discourse strongly emphasisin g ‘cultural diversity’ and 

  ‘tolerance’ as core characteristics of Australian n ational identity, crucial to the 

   6 

  country’s future prosperity. Controversially, attem pts began in the early 1990s to 

  incorporate Indigenous Australians within the broad  parameters of multicultural 

  policy. This was justified on the grounds of a need  for a more inclusive approach 

  towards Indigenous Australians. It was a provocativ e move, nevertheless, in light of 

  repeated assertions by Indigenous people of their s pecial place in Australian society as 

  the country’s original owners, and their unwillingn ess to be seen as just one more 

  ethnic group amongst many.  

  

  The Hawke-Keating Labor years had mixed results, raising important questions about 

  the broad direction of policies since the 1980s and  whether it has effectively fulfilled 

  the social justice objectives that were fundamental  to multiculturalism’s evolution in 

  the first place. On the one hand, new settlers and cosmopolitans responded positively 

  to attempts to better incorporate immigrants and In digenous Australians into the 

  national story. Ethnic groups enjoyed a closer dial ogue with governments at both state 

  and federal level. Australia experienced relatively  little ethnic conflict. On the other 

  hand, many migrants continued to experience structu ral inequities and injustices. 

  Australian Bureau of Statistics data reveals that i n June 1995, the unemployment rate 

  for migrants of non-English speaking background (NESB) was 12.2 per cent, 

  compared to a national average of 8.1 per cent. The  rate for some groups was much 

  higher, including Lebanese (25.1) and Vietnamese (26.8) (ABS 1995, cited in Castles 

  2001, p. 810). Castles’ (2001, p. 810) sobering ass essment is that multiculturalism 

  during this period ‘did not succeed in eliminating racism and the social exclusion of 

  minorities’.  

  

  Hindsight also reveals mainstream Australia’s uneas e with aspects of Labor’s 

  approach. The party’s election loss in 1996 which b rought John Howard’s coalition 

  government to power has generally been attributed t o popular hostility towards former 

  Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating’s ‘big picture’, ‘new values’ politics in which 

  multiculturalism loomed large (Brett 2005, Markus 2001). Labor’s strong association 

  with ethnic interests was undoubtedly another contr ibuting factor.      

  

  Multiculturalism under Howard    

  The current Prime Minister’s long-standing suspicio n of multiculturalism is well 

  known. He studiously avoided the term for years while opposition leader. He 

   7 

  precipitated a major debate in 1988 when he publicl y queried the rate of Asian 

  immigration. He openly declared in 1997 that ‘multi culturalism is in effect saying that 

  it is impossible to have an Australian ethos, that it is impossible to have a common 

  Australian culture. So we have to pretend that we a re a federation of cultures and that 

  we’ve got a bit from every part of the world’ (cite d in Brett 2005, p. 37).  

  

  His reticence was apparently confirmed when he won office in 1996 and his 

  government immediately abolished key multicultural programs including the Office 

  of Multicultural Affairs and the research-oriented BIMPR. Spending was decreased 

  on a range of welfare and services, including the c apacity of newcomers to access 

  unemployment benefits and the Adult Migrant English program. Ethnic organizations 

  like FECCA were quickly marginalised, the government setting limits on funding and 

  downgrading consultative efforts. Very controversia lly, Indigenous Affairs was 

  merged into the portfolios of Immigration and Multi culturalism â a decision 

  interpreted by many as further evidence of the gove rnment’s hostility towards 

  Indigenous self-determination.  

  

  The Howard era has also been marked by a series of controversial decisions and 

  debates. This began with the Prime Minister’s elect ion in 1996 on the back of a 

  populist pledge to rule ‘For All of Us’ (a message many believed was a veiled appeal 

  to Australia’s Anglo-mainstream), continued with hi s refusal at first to repudiate the 

  anti-immigration, anti-multicultural, anti-Indigeno us claims of Independent MP 

  Pauline Hanson, and the sordid Tampa crisis and ‘ch ildren overboard’ affair in which 

  unauthorised asylum-seekers from the Middle East were vilified as a threat to national 

  sovereignty and the cultural and ethical standards of decent, mainstream Australians. 

  This led in turn to the introduction of one of the developed world’s most hard-line 

  approaches to unauthorised asylum-seekers â with th e blessing of a majority of the 

  public (Markus 2001; Marr and Wilkinson 2003; Manne and Corlett 2004).  

  

  Most recently, the terrorist bombings in London and  Bali have sparked renewed 

  debate within Australia about multiculturalism (Par kinson 19 July 2005). Government 

  members have apparently encouraged anti-multicultural sentiment with hints of the 

  dangers lurking beneath Australia’s seemingly calm multi-ethnic exterior. Howard has 

  warned that a close eye will be kept on Muslim mosques, prayer halls and schools to 

   8 

  ensure they are not disseminating extremist ideas a nd encouraging terrorism. Various 

  senior ministers have jostled to outdo each other i n public declarations of loyalty to 

  the nation, and severe rebukes of those they believ e are not acting ‘Australian’ 

  enough. Liberal MPs Sophie Panapolous and Bronwyn Bishop have gone so far as to 

  recommend that Muslim girls in state schools be ban ned from wearing the hijab, the 

  wearing of which by young people, they insist, is n ot much more than an ‘act of 

  rebellion’, ‘an iconic item of defiance’( Age  26 Aug. 2005). In the wake of the 

  Cronulla riots, questions have inevitably being ask ed about the extent to which they 

  were fuelled by anti-Muslim rhetoric within government circles in recent months.  

  

  Still, there is an inherent paradox about Australia n immigration policy during the past 

  decade that many of the current government’s critic s fail to acknowledge. Since 1996 

  immigration rates have increased steadily to approx imately 130,000-140,000 in 2005-06 (excluding humanitarian and refugee intakes). Th is is almost double the number of 

  people entering when Howard first took power a decade ago. The overseas-born now 

  represent approximately 23 per cent of the Australi an population. Ethnic diversity 

  remains a crucial feature of annual immigration int akes and of the population as a 

  whole, with almost 200 different language groups ca lling Australia home. Despite 

  historical antipathy towards Asian immigration, set tlers born in that region now 

  represent almost 42 per cent of annual entry rates.  Australia’s ethnic composition is 

  also significantly affected by the large influx of temporary visitors it receives each 

  year, including tourists, students, and now increas ingly, temporary workers. Whether 

  he admits it or not, as journalist Paul Kelly recen tly pointed out, ‘Howard is now one 

  of the main architects of Australia as a multicultu ral society’ (Kelly 2005).      

  

  The Prime Minister, furthermore, has not completely  overturned Australia’s 

  commitment to multiculturalism. The Racial Discrimination Act remains in place. In 

  1999, after some initial equivocation, his governme nt publicly reaffirmed its 

  commitment to multicultural principles in the form of a policy document: New 

  Agenda for a Multicultural Australia.  It re-endorsed it again in 2002 in the form of 

  the statement Multicultural Australia: United in Diversity: Updat ing the1999 New 

  Agenda for Multicultural Australia  (Commonwealth Government of Australia 2002). 

  

   9 

  These statements go further than previous ones in t heir determined shift away from an 

  ‘ethnic rights’ model, declaring multiculturalism t o be for all Australians, not just 

  migrants (the decision to append the prefix Australian  to the term multiculturalism is 

  prime evidence of that). But they show significant policy continuities as well. The 

  recent statement identifies four main principles of  multiculturalism: a) the 

  responsibilities of all Australians ‘to support tho se basic structures and principles of 

  Australian society which guarantee us our freedom a nd equality’, b) the right of all 

  Australians, subject to the law, ‘to express their own culture and beliefs’ and the 

  reciprocal obligation for them to respect the right s of others, c) that all Australians are 

  entitled to equality of treatment and opportunity, d) that all Australians benefit from 

  productive diversity, that is ‘the cultural, social  and economic dividends arising from 

  diversity’. Such claims effectively endorse the pri nciples established in Hawke’s 

  National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia of 1989, with its acknowledgment of 

  the reality of cultural pluralism in Australia, its  strong focus on the rights and 

  responsibilities of all citizens, the economic bene fits of immigration and 

  multiculturalism, and nominal support for principle s of social justice and equity.   

  

  There is further evidence of policy continuity, des pite overall cuts to migrant 

  spending and different points of emphases. Key mult icultural institutions have been 

  maintained, including the SBS, the nation-wide Tran slator and Interpreter Service, the 

  Adult Migrant English Program, numerous settlement and migrant community service 

  programs and promotion of the benefits of cultural diversity (DIMIA Population 

  Flows 2002-2003; Budget Statements 2005-2006). There are new initiatives as well, 

  like the education-focused Living in Harmony Initiative , an Access and Equity 

  Strategy to enhance migrant access to government se rvices, and the Council for 

  Multicultural Australia that provides policy advice  to government. These latter 

  programs have correctly been identified as having l imited substantive effect (Jupp 

  2005, p. 179), but, again, they indicate some conti nuity with the broad principles and 

  policies set down in the Hawke-Keating era. Overall  funding for multicultural, 

  citizenship and settlement programs has increased s teadily during recent years, in line 

   10  

  with increases in immigration intakes. 2 It is a fact that Howard’s critics have given 

  surprisingly little attention to. 

  

  How do we explain the anomalous position of the Howard Government? The apparent 

  retreat from the orthodoxies and institutions of th e past three decades are no doubt 

  largely attributable to the Prime Minister’s person al outlook, political considerations 

  and the remarkable influence he has had over public  policy and political culture 

  during the last ten years. Howard possesses a funda mentally liberal-conservative view 

  of the national community. He understands society i n key terms of ‘individuals’ 

  ‘family’ and ‘nation’. He strongly endorses what ph ilosopher Charles Taylor calls ‘the 

  politics of dignity’, that is the liberal assumptio n of the fundamental equality and 

  dignity of all human life (Taylor 2004). Strictly s peaking, Howard is not the racist that 

  many of his critics claim him to be.  

  

  His perspective, however, makes him inherently suspicious of the ‘politics of 

  difference.’ As Howard himself pointed out in the l ate 1980s, multiculturalism is 

  problematic for him because it ‘ensnares individual s in ethnic communities, denying 

  them the opportunity to fully participate in Austra lian society’. It risks limiting the 

  freedoms of individuals and dividing the nation. It  has the potential to subvert the 

  notion of equality for all by giving undue influenc e and benefits to special interests 

  (see Brett 2005, pp. 24-28). In this respect, Howar d’s personal concerns embody those 

  of many liberal democratic polities today as they a ttempt to balance demands for 

  equality to be extended to the recognition of ‘part icularity’, with long-held liberal 

  views about equality and blindness to difference.                 

  

  Howard’s respect for individual rights and antipath y for ethnic politics are regarded 

  by his supporters as evidence of a true egalitarian ism and inclusiveness. This is partly 

  true (the end of the White Australia policy was fou nded after all, on the refusal to 

  continue to recognise racial difference in immigrat ion and citizenship policies). There 

  are limits to this outlook, nevertheless. Howard’s public discourse tends to downplay 

  the significance of ethnicity in the formation of p ersonal identity, portraying it almost                                                   

  2  The total price of outputs for citizenship, cultura l diversity and settlement programs increased from  $84.43 million in 1999-2000 to $141.4 million in 200 5-06. The largest increase was in the area of  settlement services (Commonwealth Government of Australia, Department of Immigration and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Portfolio Addit ional Estimates Statements, 1999-2006).    

   11  

  like a lifestyle choice rather than a deeply embedd ed sense of values and associations. 

  Happy to laud the cultural contributions of migrant s to Australian society, and to urge 

  their unequivocal loyalty to Australia, he is less likely to acknowledge the difficulties 

  migrants face in dropping old values and habits, an d embracing new ones (this is by 

  no means a trait unique to Howard of course). More problematic is his neglect of the 

  ways in which race and ethnicity can structure soci al relations and entrench powerful 

  inequalities and injustices; manifested, for exampl e, in his consistent refusal to 

  acknowledge the reality of racism in Australian soc iety.    

  

  The Prime Minister’s retreat from multicultural ide als is not explained by personal 

  values alone. Politics has also been a powerful mot ivating factor. One of the most 

  striking characteristics of his years in power have  been his attempts to distinguish his 

  government’s record of achievements from that of hi s Labor predecessors, especially 

  in the areas of social and cultural policy. More ur gent still, has been the matter of 

  winning and keeping the support of those elements i n the community who have 

  transformed their contempt for globalisation and po st-material values, including 

  multiculturalism, into a significant electoral forc e in recent times. This includes the 

  socially-conservative blue collar battlers who dese rted Labor in 1996 and the one 

  million people who voted for the populist Pauline H anson’s One Nation Party  in the 

  1998 federal election, on the back of that party’s strong anti-immigration, anti-multicultural, anti-Indigenous campaign.   

  

  Practical considerations drive Howard’s policies as  well; namely the broad 

  transformation of Australia’s economy and society d uring the past two decades, and 

  changing assumptions of the role of government. While it was a Labor Government 

  that initiated a broad program of neo-liberal refor m in Australia during the 1980s, it is 

  the current government that has overseen the almost  near-completion transformation 

  of the economy, with significant cuts to government  spending, and the liberalisation 

  of the labour market, financial sector, industry an d trade. Cuts to migrant settlement 

  services and the de-institutionalisation of multicu lturalism are no doubt aspects of a 

  much broader rationalisation of government spending and services. They may also be 

  attributable to the changing nature of immigration during the past two decades. With 

  the Skill stream now constituting approximately 65 per cent of the Migration program 

   12  

  (almost 78,000 migrants entered under this stream i n 2004-05), and an increasing 

  proportion of migrants now possessing English skill s, there is presumably less overall 

  demand today for social welfare and settlement serv ices than there was during the 

  eras of high unskilled immigration of previous deca des.    

  

  The Prime Minister’s worldview no doubt blinds him to the extent to which human 

  dignity and respect requires the accommodation of c ultural difference and ‘the politics 

  of equal worth’. But Howard is not completely indif ferent to or unaffected by the 

  enormous changes Australian society has undergone during the past thirty years, or 

  the social, moral and political and practical princ iples at stake. His government’s most 

  recent multicultural statement expressly and repeat edly acknowledges the reality of 

  cultural diversity in Australia and the fundamental  right of citizens to express their 

  cultural differences; albeit always in deference to  ‘core’ civic and national values: 

  ‘Citizenship is a strong unifying force in our dive rse multicultural community. Our 

  commitment to and defence of Australian values of equality, democracy and freedom 

  unite us in our diverse origins, and enhance the ab ility of all of us to participate fully 

  in all spheres of Australian society (Commonwealth Government of Australia 2002, p. 

  6).      

  

  Howard is also a deeply pragmatic man, well attuned to the practical consequences of 

  the neo-liberal project he is close to completing. Cultural pluralism is an inescapable 

  consequence of economic globalisation and Australia’s increasingly porous economic 

  and geographic boundaries. This offers both benefit s and challenges for governments. 

  Multiculturalism is a valuable cultural asset for a  country keen to attract highly 

  skilled, cosmopolitan middle-class professionals to  its shores (Hage 2003). A multi-ethnic population is also a tangible material resou rce for a nation-state keen to further 

  its economic and strategic interests in the global market. As the current statement on 

  multiculturalism points out: ‘It helps us to forge links with the rest of the world that 

  can deliver increased trade and investment through the expansion of markets and the 

  development of diverse goods and services’ (Commonwealth Government of 

  Australia 2002, p. 8). On the other hand, high immi gration and ethnic pluralism 

  present ongoing challenges for liberal democratic g overnments in terms of justice and 

  equity, and maintaining social cohesion and stabili ty. This has undoubtedly compelled 

   13  

  a continuing commitment to migrant settlement servi ces and cultural diversity 

  programs.          

  

  Cultural pluralism and thirty years of multicultura l policy have also created their own 

  political momentum. Howard’s early years as Prime Minister were characteried by his 

  desire to distinguish himself from Keating and his resistance to the ethnic politics of 

  the Labor Party. But political longevity and the La bor Party’s woes have given 

  Howard more confidence and a sense of control over the nation’s destiny. 

  Multiculturalism is no longer the political and cul tural threat it once seemed (even if 

  the government’s public discourse at the moment suggests otherwise).  

  

  There is also the matter of public opinion. Notwith standing the electoral strength of 

  Howard’s socially conservative battlers, majority o pinion still apparently favours the 

  status quo; that is, the maintenance of multicultur alism (this, after all, has now been in 

  place for over thirty years, far longer than assimi lation lasted as the official postwar 

  settlement policy for migrants). Whatever the perso nal views and political preferences 

  of government members, or the quirks of the Austral ian electoral system that allow 

  elections to be won and lost on the basis of few se ats, they cannot entirely ignore the 

  support for multicultural ideals amongst key sectio ns of the population, including 

  immigrants, the business community, the nation’s in tellectual elite, influential 

  sections of the mainstream media, bureaucrats, and sections of both the Labor and 

  Liberal parties.  

  

  A pointed reminder of this was the results of two o pinion polls released in the 

  immediate wake of the Cronulla riots. One, a Sydney Morning Herald-Age  poll, found 

  that 80 per cent of respondents supported multicult uralism and only 10 per cent 

  opposed it. The other, The Australian’s  Newspoll , suggested far more opposition, with 

  more than double the amount reporting that multicul turalism is bad for Australia 

  (Kelly 2005). While not underestimating the signifi cance of the resistance expressed, 

  or the specific factors that may have distorted the se poll results (for example, people 

  using the poll as a protest against the riots), the y suggest that multiculturalism still 

  carries some positive leverage, and that a radical shift in policy will be avoided unless 

  domestic and international political circumstances change dramatically. This is not 

  surprising. Incrementalism is a common feature of p olicy-making in pluralistic 

   14  

  liberal-democracies like Australia, as governments constantly attempt to balance a 

  variety of competing pressures, interests and value s. Notwithstanding Howard’s 

  overwhelming political success, and the revolutiona ry nature of some of his reforms, 

  especially since winning control of the Senate, we should not ignore evidence of 

  caution and continuity in politically sensitive por tfolios, or where the policy 

  fundamentals seem right.         

  

  John Howard’s resolution of his multicultural parad ox has been to walk a fine line, 

  moving ambivalently between an overtly assimilationist and ‘soft’ cultural pluralist 

  position. He has conceded minimal ground to the plu ralists with his pragmatic 

  acknowledgment of the reality of cultural diversity  in Australia, and the inherent right 

  of people to express and maintain their cultural id entity. He has maintained those 

  aspects of immigrant settlement and cultural policy  that are fundamental to the 

  maintenance of social order and well-being, or whic h achieve positive cultural, social 

  and political outcomes. At the same time he has str ipped policy of its more radical 

  political and ideological potential, especially in relation to ‘ethnic rights’, structural 

  pluralism and national identity. He has constructed  a public discourse of ‘core values’ 

  and ‘core identity’ that has been highly popular an d differentiates his government 

  from his main political rivals, even if a close exa mination reveals some policy 

  continuities.        

  

  If Howard’s ambivalence frustrates his critics, it must also be conceded that it reflects 

  Australia’s own; a settler society which has always  been sensitive towards 

  immigration and which continues today to oscillate between loyalty to its British 

  colonial, social liberal origins and traditions, an d the attractions of the brave new, 

  globalised, neo-liberal, pluralistic, multi-ethnic realities of the early 21 st  century 

  (Beilharz 2005; Dixson 1999). Herein lies one of th e fundamental paradoxes of 

  Howard’s success. This very ambivalence, this willingness to live with paradox,  has 

  undoubtedly contributed to his electoral strength a nd his ability to carry his beloved 

  ‘middle Australia’ with him on sensitive cultural a nd economic issues.  

  

  It is not incidental that attitudes towards immigra tion have stabilised since the Hanson 

  controversies of the late 1990s, despite significan t increases in immigration. This 

  partly reflects heightened economic optimism. It al so attests to the Howard 

   15  

  government’s astute political handling of the immig ration portfolio as a whole (as 

  distinct from ethical and practical considerations,  and whether the national interest has 

  always been served). As Brett suggests, Howard’s co nsummate skill as a politician, 

  unlike his predecessor Paul Keating, has been his c apacity to position himself at the 

  centre of mainstream Australia, not beyond it or ab ove it: ‘Where Keating spoke to 

  the nation, Howard spoke from it â straight from th e heart of its shared beliefs and 

  commonsense understandings of itself’ (Brett 2005, p. 32). When Howard publicly 

  admits his mixed feelings towards immigration and multiculturalism, and his 

  preference for ‘core’ values and an unequivocal (ho mogeneous) identity, he 

  simultaneously amplifies people’s own anxieties abo ut such issues and assures them 

  that in matters of national values and identity he is really on their side â no matter 

  what is actually happening in policy terms.   

  

  This is not to deny the limits of Howard’s approach  or the potential dangers it 

  contains. His handling of immigration and multicult ural issues has been politically 

  astute in some respects, but it also holds inherent  dangers, not least for his 

  government. For every foray into the politics of im migration brings with it the 

  capacity to alienate yet another ethnic group or se gment of the community, or perhaps 

  more significantly, to create unrealistic expectati ons about policy outcomes amongst 

  more conservative segments of the population (note,  for example, Pauline Hanson’s 

  immediate response to Peter Costello’s comments on multiculturalism this week that 

  if he was really serious about the intention to str ip people of their citizenship if they 

  failed to respect Australian values, he should imme diately introduce some legislation).  

  

  Notwithstanding some broad continuities in policy a nd principle, Howard’s ultra- 

  ‘soft’ multiculturalism also represents another ste p away from the doctrine’s original 

  commitment to enhancing the social and economic status of migrants in real terms (a 

  retreat that began with the Hawke Labor Government’s National Agenda for a 

  Multicultural Australia of 1989). The Prime Ministe r often refers to the ‘tolerance’ of 

  Australians in his public speeches, and the contrib ution this has made to the overall 

  success of our immigration program. This is undenia bly true. But tolerance is not the 

  open respect and understanding between ethnic groups that many people aspire to, 

  and underestimates, perhaps, the true potential of multiculturalism (it is telling that 

   16  

  more than thirty years since the inception of multi culturalism, some politicians still 

  see the wearing of the hijab as a lifestyle choice! ).  

  

  Neither is tolerance adequate to the task of uphold ing professed national principles of 

  social justice and equity. Despite the strong rheto ric of ‘equality’ favoured by Howard 

  and other neo-liberals, many migrant success storie s, and the middle-class nature of 

  contemporary immigration, the available evidence suggests that significant numbers 

  of settlers continue to experience real inequalitie s, including older groups from 

  Southern Europe, lower-skilled immigrants, and vari ous refugee groups who have 

  arrived since the 1970s, including those from Vietn am, Lebanon, the Middle East and 

  African nations (see Cresciani 2003; Castles 2001, p. 810; Coughlan 2001, pp. 730-31; Australian , 4 January 2006). This inequality is by no means n ew, as I’ve already 

  suggested, and suggest continuing deficiencies in i mmigration settlement policies. In 

  the absence of more concerted efforts, the social a nd economic gap between such 

  groups and middle Australia is set to grow.            

  

  Finally, concerns remain as to whether the governme nt’s approach is sufficient to 

  steer the country through the difficult challenges to national sovereignty, stability and 

  identity currently posed by issues such as terroris m, religious fundamentalism, 

  refugee pressures, economic and social inequality, and growing ethnic tension. 

  Howard’s willingness to exploit the politics of imm igration and ethnicity, epitomised 

  by the Tampa crisis and ‘children overboard’ affair  may have won him some short-term electoral benefits, but it has come at the exp ense of his government’s moral 

  authority, Australia’s social fabric and reputation , and the human rights of many 

  vulnerable people. These developments are a potent reminder as well of the rapidity 

  with which public policy and opinion can lapse into  more sinister forms of 

  ethnic/racial politics if circumstances and politic s allow. Australia’s long adherence to 

  multicultural principles and programs, and its gene rally positive history of ethnic 

  harmony, offer no absolute protection against futur e problems. The recent Cronulla 

  riots are an important reminder in this respect.           

  

  Conclusion 

  Multiculturalism has defined Australian settlement policy for over thirty years, 

  officially acknowledging the reality of cultural pl uralism in Australia, and affirming 

   17  

  the responsibility of governments to manage that pl uralism and assist the integration 

  of new settlers through institutional means. Despit e its longevity, it has always been a 

  highly contested policy and doctrine, with public o pinion divided about its meanings, 

  objectives and functions, and policy emphases shift ing in accordance with changing 

  circumstances. Successive leaders, beginning with t he Hawke Labor Government 

  during the 1980s, have struggled to balance social realities and the needs of migrants 

  with broader political pressures. It is questionabl e whether multicultural policies, as 

  they have evolved since the late 1980s, have achiev ed the social justice and equity 

  considerations of its original architects.    

  

  Since winning power in 1996, the Howard Government has endorsed the broad 

  principles and policy directions set down by the Ha wke Labor government in the 

  1980s, while at the same time further affirming the  limits of Australian 

  multiculturalism with its strong civic-nationalist emphasis on core values and identity, 

  its shift away from principles of ethnic rights and  social justice, and the abolition of 

  some policies and programs. These narrow parameters have been politically popular 

  but are problematic in the context of current threa ts to social stability. They represent 

  a step backwards in the path towards a progressive immigration settlement policy and 

  the creation of a stable, cohesive multi-ethnic soc iety that began tentatively with the 

  introduction of mass European immigration in the 1940s. Still, the momentum of high 

  immigration and thus cultural pluralism continues u nabated, as does the need for 

  governments to deal responsibly, practically and et hically with this particular social 

  reality in the interests of social stability and fu ture prosperity. While it has no doubt 

  suffered a significant blow, claims of the death of  Australian multiculturalism are 

  premature.
