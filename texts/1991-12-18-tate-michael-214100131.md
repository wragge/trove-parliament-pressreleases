 MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS

 The Government has warned that the Opposition's GST package will  destroy Australia'  legal aid system and deny access to justice  for almost 15,000 Australians on very low incomes.

 The Federal Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator  Michael Tate, said the package contained a double blow for legal  aid.

 "The system will suffer a major cut in income, as well as a very  significant blow-out in costs", he said.

 As a result, innocent people may end up in gaol, many parents  involved in family disputes will be denied access to children,  and unscrupulous landlords may succeed in unlawfully evicting  defenceless tenants.

 "On the eve of Christmas these measures threaten a reversion to  Dickensian times", Senator Tate said.

 He called on members of the legal profession to become advocates  for the poor,  and to demand that the Opposition abandon this  assault on legal aid.

 Senator Tate released an assessment of the impact on legal aid of  the Opposition's Fightback package. The assessment has been  endorsed by the Department of Finance.

 The Opposition package includes a cut of $10 million in the $134  million annual Commonwealth contribution to legal aid, which Dr  Hewson has asserted can be saved on administrative costs.

 "But the total spent this year by the Commissions on non-legal  administrative costs for legal aid throughout Australia is only  $11.3 million", Senator Tate said.

 "To remove $10 million from this figure would,  quite simply,  destroy the system.

 "Alternatively, Dr Hewson is guilty of making a commitment which  both he and the legal aid system know he will find it impossible  to honour",  Senator Tate said.

 "On top of this, the costs to each of the State and Territory  Legal Aid Commissions around the country of briefing outside  lawyers will be greatly increased by the goods and services tax.

 LEGAL AID ON HEWSON HIT LIST

 "As approximately 60 percent of the work of most Commissions is  contracted out to private legal practices,  legal aid services  will have to be drastically curtailed.

 "When a Commission briefs a lawyer to represent somebody in the  criminal courts,  or in a custody dispute in the Family Court, the  Commission will have to pay an extra 15 percent GST on the bill.

 "Legal aid money will be going into the Federal Treasury via the  GST, rather than for the benefit of people who desperately need  it", Senator Tate said.

 "Some work will be done in-house, but the amount of contracted  work will have to be drastically reduced because the Legal Aid  Commissions will be unable to afford it with their reduced  budgets and higher costs".

 The cumulative effect of the funding cut and the GST cost  increases means a loss of $31.5m in Commonwealth legal aid  funding.

 "At the current average cost per case of $1,236, that means  14,633 cases per year would not be able to be funded - denying  that number of people access to justice".

 Senator Tate said the effect of the changes proposed in the  Opposition package would be to negate all the Commonwealth/State  and Commonwealth/Territory legal aid agreements around Australia.

 "The financial basis for these agreements will be completely  destroyed", he said.

 "And the tragedy is that the people who will suffer are among the  most vulnerable in the community.

 Senator Tate said legal aid was a service for the benefit of  those on very low incomes who had no alternative means of help.

 "It perfectly illustrates the fact that the Opposition Leader has  crafted a package designed to penalise the most vulnerable  sections of the Australian community".

 NOTES TO ANALYSIS

 (A) S10M Efficiency Savina

 .  If this saving was found directly from funding for Legal Aid Commissions there would have to be agreement between  the Commonwealth and the States as funding is the subject 

 of Commonwealth/State agreements.

 . A reduction of $10m in Commonwealth inputs outlays would

 be likely to result in an additional corresponding cut in  State outlays as the States would be likely to seek to  match under the funding ratio. The announced reduction of  5% in general purpose grants to the States may also 

 encourage such a reduction.

 .  A requirement that Commissions absorb the effect of any reduction in Government funding in a particular way, such  as without reducing services would raise serious 

 implications in regard to the statutory independence of  Commissions.

 .  If the reduction was applied across the total Legal Aid Program funded by the Commonwealth generally, and  specifically directed against salaries and administrative  costs, a maximum of up to $1.7m could be achieved by 

 abolishing the legal aid function of the Office of Legal  Aid and Family Services with the balance applied to 

 Commission inputs. However, agreement would have to be  reached with the States and independent Commissions to 

 undertaking the following functions or services for which  they would require supplementation:

 (a) Financial Assistance Schemes (solely a Commonwealth  responsibility)

 (b) Collection and dissemination of national legal aid 

 statistics.

 * V  *

 2.

 (c) Provision of a national co-ordinating role for Legal 

 Aid.

 (d) Co-ordination and evaluation of  funding/programs/operations of Community Legal  Centres and Legal Aid Commissions.

 (e) Co-ordination and evaluation of the legal aid aspects  of the Child Support Scheme and the Refugee Status  process.

 (f) Provision of a central research function.

 The balance of the cut ($8.3m together with the reduced  State input of $6.Om) if applied to Commissions could not  be achieved solely from non legal services supporting  administrative functions ($9.9m est.). Moreover, any  reduction in corporate administration would be likely to 

 impact on the delivery of legal services.

 (B) Application of GST 15%

 .  Indications are that Legal Aid Organisations will not be exempt from the GST.

 .  The cost of the GST on referred legal payments could be

 reduced if more legal services were undertaken in-house by  salaried lawyers.

 - This could not always be undertaken for reasons of  conflict.

 - There would be additional non-salary administrative  costs offsets.
