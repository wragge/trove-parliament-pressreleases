 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats Immigration Spokesperson

 24 May 2002                            MEDIA RELEASE                02/263

 Government attempt to bribe desperate people is shameful The Australian Democrats have criticised the Federal Government’s offer of repatriation money to Afghani refugees as a shameful bribe, which proves the Pacific Solution is not working.  

 Democrats’ spokesperson on immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett said the Government had put people through hell for nothing more than political gain.  

 “These people have been forced to spend six months or more in detention, by a government that has refused to offer any durable solution to those seeking asylum,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “We have been told repeatedly by representatives of the community in Australia that refugees who return with money will be targeted as soon as they land in Afghanistan.

 “The Government is taking an irresponsible approach by placing vulnerable people in such a dangerous situation.

 “It would be sensible to allow them to stay in Australia, increase our assistance to Afghanistan and ensure the country returns to a stable state.

 “Once again the Minister Ruddock is misrepresenting the situation refugees face. He is attempting to paint their predicament as an economic lifestyle choice.

 “This tactic did not work with the Kosovar refugees, hundreds of people were forced home to situations that were dangerous and unstable.

 “It was a shameful solution then and it remains so now,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
