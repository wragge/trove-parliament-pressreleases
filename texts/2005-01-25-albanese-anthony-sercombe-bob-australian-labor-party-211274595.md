 LABOR SLAMS NAURU NUCLEAR DUMP   

 Labor is deeply concerned by reports in today’s media that the Howard  Government has not ruled out using the Pacific island state of Nauru as a  dumping ground for radioactive waste from Sydney’s Lucas Heights  reactor.   

 After using Nauru as a key part of its infamous “Pacific Solution” for  asylum-seekers, the Howard Government now wants to exploit the island  as a dumping ground for Australia’s radioactive waste.   

 “Nauru’s recent history of political and economic instability would not give  any Australian much confidence that the level of security such a sensitive  facility requires can be assured.  Add to that the geological concerns of  former chief defence scientist, Richard Brabin-Smith, and it is mind-boggling that Nauru is still under consideration by the Howard  Government,” said Anthony Albanese, Labor Environment spokesperson. 

 

 Furthermore, the proposal to locate a nuclear dump on Nauru would  breach the Waigani Convention signed by Australia in 1995 and which  came into force in 2001. 

 

 The Convention is an important initiative which seeks to ban the exporting  of hazardous and radioactive waste to all Forum island nations and ensure  any trans-boundary movements of such waste is conducted in an  environmental sound matter.   

 “At a time when Australia is seeking to actively reengage with the nations  of the South Pacific, this proposal is sending out all the wrong signals.   

 “The Australian Government is supposed to be committed to developing  and maintaining partnerships in the South Pacific through effective regional  cooperation.  The Waigani Convention is an important part of this and must  be respected,” said Bob Sercombe, Labor’s spokesperson on the Pacific  Islands.
