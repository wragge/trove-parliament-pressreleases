 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania  

 Senate votes up Chen inquiry 

 16th Jun 2005 

 The Senate has voted 35 to 29 to set up an inquiry into the  government’s mishandling of the defection of Chinese diplomat Chen  Yonglin.  The Greens proposed the inquiry last week.  The Government  voted against the inquiry.    

 This morning the Senate backed the following proposal after it was  jointly moved by Senators Brown, Ludwig(Labor) and Stott-Despoja  (Democrats):    

 That the following matters be referred to the Foreign Affairs and Trade  References Committee for Inquiry and report by 9 August 2005.  

 1. the responses of DIMIA, DFAT, AGD and their respective  Ministers to Mr Chen Yonglin’s approaches or requests to the  Australian Government for asylum and/or a protection visa 

 1. the application of the Migration Act 1958, its regulations and  guidelines concerning the maintenance of confidentiality for any  consular officials or staff (including Mr Chen Yonglin, and any  other former consular officials or staff) who were applicants for  territorial asylum and/or protection visas by Department of  Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade and their respective Ministers; 

 1. the involvement of DFAT and the Minister in the deportation,  search and discovery of Vivian Solon, and: 

 1. any related matters 

 

 “Serious questions have arisen including those about information  passed to the Chinese authorities by the Australian government after  Mr Chen’s defection.  This inquiry will enable those questions to be  answered,” Senator Brown said.
