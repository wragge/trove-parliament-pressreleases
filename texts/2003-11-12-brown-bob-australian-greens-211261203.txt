 Sen Bob Brown   

 

 

 PRESS  RELEASE  Wednesday 12 November 2003   

 

 

 Greens Launch SA Senate Team   

 Nurseryman and environmentalist Brian Noone will head the Australian Greens  Senate team for the next election, Greens Senator Bob Brown and MP Kris  Hanna announced in Adelaide today.   

 The team is:  Brian Noone, business owner and environmental campaigner;  Clare McCarty, teacher and well-known union activist, and Mij Tanith, refugee  rights activist and high-profile member of the gay and lesbian community. 

 

 The Greens are growing rapidly and have excellent prospects of winning a  Senate seat in South Australia, especially in a double-dissolution election,  according to Senator Brown.   

 "We'll be running hard on issues like safeguarding public health, education,  water, adopting humane refugee policies and making South Australia a green  energy leader in the fight to halt global warming," said Mr Hanna.   

 "The Greens' campaign will mix grassroots enthusiasm with cutting edge on-line  technology and a great team of candidates.   

 "I'm looking forward to the Green team joining me in the Senate," said Senator  Brown.
