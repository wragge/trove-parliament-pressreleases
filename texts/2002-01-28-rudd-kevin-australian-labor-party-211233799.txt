  KEVIN -RUDD MOP.  Shadow Minister for Foreign Aflairs  HOWARD GOVERNMENT NOT SERIOUS ABOUT DEALING  WITH THE REFUGEE PROBLEM AT SOURCE 

  AUSTRALIA’S FINANCIAL C0MMITR.IENT TO THE RECONSTRUCTION OF  AFGHANISTAN DWARFED BY T H E  COST OF ’PACIFIC SOLUTION’ 

  ONLY $1 7 M EXTRA FOR 5,600,000 REFUGEES AT SOURCE - COMPARED WTH  $285M FOR 1,500 REFUGEES ON NAURU, MANUS AND CHRISTMAS ISLAND 

  ”Australia’s contributions to humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts in  Afghanistan are dwarfed by the cost of the Howard Government’s so-called ‘Pacific  Solution”’, the Shadow Minister for Foreign affairs, Kevin Rudd, said today. 

  “Last week’s revelations that the Government has spent A$285 million on its strategy to  deposit asylum seekers on Pacific Islands and is planning to budget as much as A$200  milhon a year for five years, stand in stark contrast to Australia’s modest commitment to  help address the Afghani refugee crisis at its source.” 

  ”Last Monday the Government made much of its pledge at the Tokyo Conference on  Reconstruction Aid for Afghanistan of an additional A$17 million of assistance. This  commitment brings Australia’s total contribution to relief and reconstruction efforts in  Afghanistan to A$40.3 million (US$20.9 million) in the current financial year.” 

  ”While the commitment of additional aid funds is welcome, Australia’s contribution  remains exceptionally modest. It is a mere  14 percent of the reported cost so far of the  ‘Pacific Solution’. Moreover, at US$20.9 million, it amounts to just 1.16 percent of the  US$1.8 billion pledged by international donors for relief and reconstruction for 2002 and 

  only 0.46 percent of the total US$4.5 billion pledged at the Tokyo Conference.” 

  “Australia’s contribution of $40 million appears similarly modest when ranked against  the those of comparable countries including: 

  Canada (US$60 million h s  year);  Norway (USNO million this year);  Sweden (US$96 milhon over three years);  Netherlands (US$62 million over three years); and  South Korea (US$45 million over the next 2 l/2 years).” 

  ”Taking into account the relative sizes of these economies, Norway’s commitment this  year, for example, is more than five times greater than that of Australia, while Sweden’s 

  is more than twice the size. It should also be noted that South Korea has barely emerged  from the Asian financial crisis which devastated its economy." 

  "Nor is the Howard Government, unlike other governments, prepared to make a serious  commitment to the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Government has failed  to make any forward commitment of funds for reconstruction efforts beyond the current  financial year." 

  "A sustained international commitment to the reconstruction of Afghanistan is vital if  we are to help facilitate the return of the estimated 4.1 million Afghani refugees from  Pakistan and Iran and more than 1.5 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan.'' 

  "These cold hard figures demonstrate that the Howard Government is not serious about  addressing the refugee problem at source. Unless the economic reconstruction of  Afghanistan gets underway now, the possibility of effectively repatriating 5.6 million  Afghan refugees becomes remote. And if these refugees are not repatriated, the push  factors operating on them will result in an explosion in numbers of Afghan refugees  seeking resettlement in third countries like Australia. 

  "That in turn would mean that the $286 million that Australia has already expended on  the 'Paclfic Solution' on only 1,500 refugees will pale into insigruficance against the costs  which Australia would incur if there is a substantial increase in the numbers of Afghan  refugees arriving to our north. 

  "A long-term solution for Australia's refugees policy requires d e a h g  with the problem  effectively at source; dealing effectively with the role of transit countries like Indonesia  and Malaysia; as well as dealing effectively with those who seek to be processed and  resettled here. 

  "The Government's policy to date deals almost exclusively with the latter to the virtual  exclusion of the former - effectively ignoring the rest of the pipeline."

  INTERNATIONAL AID COMMITMENTS TO AFGHANISTAN 

  lnfomtion compiled by the Commonwealth Parliamenta y Libra y. 

  Pledges totalling $4.5 billion in foreign assistance to help rebuild Afghanistan were secured  at the International Conference on Reconstruction Aid for Afghanistan (ICRAA) hosted by  Japan on 21-22 January. (All figures are in US$). 

  Donors promised to deliver more than $1.8 billion of the total during this year. This  surpassed the estimate from a UN-World Bank study that said Afghanistan would need  $1.7 billion for the first year of reconstruction. The study also estimated the cost of  rebuilding Afghanistan at $5 billion over 2 ?h years and $15 bihon over the course of the  decade. 

  The US pledge, $297 million for this year, was the largest one-year pledge from any  individual government. 

  The European Union pledged about $500 million in the first year, including $320 million  from its member nations and $180 million from its executive body, the European  Commission. The EC is also reported to have pledged One bilhon euros ($844 million) over  the next five years. 

  The World Bank would ask its shareholders to approve $500 million in concessional loans  over the next 30 months and recommend that the bank offer at least $50 million in grants. 

  The Asian Development Bank will offer $500 million in grants and concessional loans over  the next 2 Y2 years. 

  The Islamic Development Bank has pledged $50 million. 

  The Agha Khan Development Network has pledged $75 &on in a 'multi-year  commitment'. 

  Other individual country pledges include: 

  Japan: Up to $500 million over the next 2 '12 years, with half of that to be disbursed this  year. 

  Saudi Arabia: $220 mihon over three years. 

  United Kingdom: $288 million over five years. The money wdl be in addition to money  given by the U for Afghanistan through the EU, the World Bank and the ADB. 

  Germany: $362 million over four years. 

  South Korea: $45 million for projects over the next 2 1/2 years 

  India: $100 million for this year. In addition India has offered a million tons of wheat  over five years and an additional $1 million to meet part of the immediate requirements  of the interim administration. 

  Iran: $120 million this year, rising to $560 million over five years. 

  Pakistan: $100 million over five years. 

  Canada: $60 million this year. 

  Norway: $40 million this year. 

  Sweden: Up to $96 million over three years. 

  The Netherlands: $62 million over three years. 

  Switzerland: $20 million over three years. 

  China:$Imillion. 

  e New Zealand has provided about $540,000 plus the use of a C-130 Hercules aircraft to 

  deliver humanitarian aid, the assistance of medical; teams and engineers as well as mine  clearance expertise since September 2001. It has now offered assistance with projects in  sectors where New Zealand has experience relevant to conditions in Afghanistan. 

  Most of the aid is conditional on the interim government of Afghanistan meeting the  conditions set down in the BOM agreement, whch include estabhhing peace,  representative government and eliminating terrorism and the drug trade. 

  We have prepared the graph below to illustrate the total projected aid commitments to  Afghanistan for one - five years ahead.

  We have also prepared the following graph to illustrate projected aid commitments to  Afghanistan for 2002. It should be noted that Australia has so far refused to provide a  commitment beyond 2002. It should also be noted that in the case of governments which  have offered multi-year commitments, the figures arrived at below represent their total  commitment divided by the number of years over which that commitment is intended to 

  extend.

  The final graph below seeks to illustrate the comparison between Australian's financial  commitments to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and its current stated commitment to  the 'Pacific Solution'. It should be noted that the figure of $285 million used for the  Pacific Solution may be modest compared with other reports that Cabinet prior to the last 

  election earmarked $400 - $500 million for this program.

  Commilment to Afghanistan Reconstruction  for Repatriation of 5.6 million Refugees  Commitment to 'Pacific Solution' for  Processing of 1,500 Refugees 

  Sydney Morning Herald, 24 January 2001 

  Pacific solution cost double Costello's vow 

  The Federal Government has spent almost double the amount it said its controversial Pacific  solution would cost, the Herald has been told. 

  Cabinet documents say the Government has spent $285 million on the so-called "solution" to  dump asylum seekers on Pacific nations and is planning to budget $200 million a year for  five years for it to continue, sources have said. 

  During the election campaign, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, said that only an extra $103  million would be required for the solution, with another $45 million to build new detention  centres. 

  At the time, the Government claimed no extra defence spending was required because the  sailors involved in the naval blockade to the country's north to intercept asylum seekers  would be on operational duty in any event.  A spokesman for the Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, said last night: "We don't 

  comment on alleged leaked cabinet documents."
