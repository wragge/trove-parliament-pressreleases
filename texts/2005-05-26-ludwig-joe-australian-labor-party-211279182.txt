 SPEECH TO THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES  COUNCILS OF AUSTRALIA 25th anniversary   

 Thank you for your kind introduction. 

 

 Today not only represents the start of the Federation of Ethnic Communities 

 Councils 25th Annual Conference, but is also the National Day of Healing 

 between our nation's traditional owners and later migrant communities. 

 

 So it is particularly fitting to be here today as we talk about the important national 

 tasks of maintaining community harmony and providing settlement services. 

 

 We meet today in regional Australia at the Nan Tien Temple on the traditional 

 lands of the Dharawal people.  

 

 You don’t get much more multicultural than that! 

 

 Firstly, let me start by acknowledging the excellent work that has gone into 

 putting on this conference and thank you to our hosts here at the Illawarra for 

 your fantastic work. 

 

 I do want to congratulate the FECCA executive and membership for reaching 

 their milestone of 25 years. Happy Birthday! 

 

 From that pleasant note I would like if I may to get some very unpleasant 

 business off my chest and out of the way, and then speak a little about where 

 Labor is directing its thoughts in multicultural affairs. 

 

 The Immigration Crisis 

 

 I know that you expect and demand of me some comment about the recent 

 outrages in immigration detention that have so many of the migrant community 

 upset, indignant and downright angry. 

 

 The cases of Vivian Alvarez and Cornelia Rau demonstrate that the Liberal 

 system of immigration detention is indeed a very sick and wounded system.  

 

 The problem is not a one-off - the immigration system in this country has been 

 exposed as having a massive and systemic failure.  

 

 In Estimates, Labor’s Senate team have just spent not only the past week, but 

 also the February estimates building a comprehensive record, question by 

 question of perhaps the federal Government’s single greatest systems failure 

 since Federation. 

 

 Yesterday we heard for the first time that some 200 cases are now under 

 investigation by the Palmer inquiry. If every case takes as long to investigate as 

 Cornelia Rau, we would be still waiting for a result in 50 years! 

 

 Of course, I don’t believe that would be the case, because last night Mr Palmer 

 basically quit, effective as soon as he hands the Rau report down. The other 201 

 cases are at the moment in limbo, but its clear we will be spending quite a long 

 time investigating immigration detention. 

 

 Contrary to what you might think, very few politicians enjoy or revel in the 

 destruction of a colleague’s career on the other side of the chamber. It’s a tough 

 game and a part of business, but years of service together can make you well 

 acquainted with each others strengths and foibles. 

 

 The Labor Party gave the Howard Government, and in particular Senator 

 Vanstone, a fair chance to go public and call a royal commission into the 

 problems with immigration detention.  

 

 Because our interest is first and foremost to get this mess sorted out, we virtually 

 telegraphed the hit to allow enough time for the Minister to do the right thing. 

 

 Labor’s Laurie Ferguson was first to raise the need for a Royal Commission on 

 the issue on Wednesday the 4th of May.  

 

 My opinion piece which appeared in The Australian on the following Tuesday, 

 offered as Acting Shadow Attorney-General, raised it again.  

 

 In Parliament on Budget Tuesday, Senator Vanstone was peppered with further 

 opportunities to move forward and call for a Royal Commission.  

 

 But, at every turn, a chance to do the right thing by the public was rejected for the 

 sake of political expediency. Getting the remarkable concessions we achieved 

 yesterday has not been achieved without much pulling of teeth. 

 

 Now it’s not 33 cases we are talking of, it is over two hundred. How many of 

 those fell into the chasm of misery found in the Rau and Alvarez cases is 

 unclear. 

 

 The immigration regime is clearly riddled with rot. The rot is now at the stage 

 where public confidence in the good management of Australia's immigration 

 system has been lost.  

 

 Many of the solutions to the current problem were identified by Labor before the 

 last election as a part of the comprehensive review of immigration policy by Julia 

 Gillard. 

 

 For example, an Inspector-General of Immigration Detention or the release of 

 children from detention are Labor policies that were on the table for years. 

 

 None of this was picked up by the Howard Government until it was too late. 

 

 It's clear Senator Vanstone should resign. But she is not on her own in this 

 regard. 

 

 Phillip Ruddock has a lot to answer for too. He has left the immigration 

 department as a veritable minefield of ministerial ineptitude and it's these that are 

 now blowing up in Amanda Vanstone’s face. 

 

 Pauline Hanson once said the Liberals adopted all her policies. Well she was 

 spot on when it comes to demonisation.  

 

 It was Phillip Ruddock who was in charge when Rau and Alvarez began their 

 slow sink into the immigration abyss, each alone, effectively voiceless and 

 uncared for. 

 

 The point seems to be that, unconsciously, the bureaucracy has now been 

 infected with the Liberal’s anti-immigrant paranoia.  

 

 If there is as, Senator Vanstone contends, a culture problem, then Minister 

 Ruddock is the source.  

 

 I cannot and will not believe that this systemic failure is somehow all the 

 Department’s fault and that the offices of Ministers Ruddock and Vanstone saw, 

 heard and knew nothing.  

 

 Immigration Ministers are in charge of the Migration Series Instructions issued in 

 their names. Ministers are in charge of monitoring the application of court rulings 

 to their portfolios. Ministers set the policy framework within which the Department 

 works. 

 

 Whether by deliberate or unintentional ignorance of court precedent and 

 supervision of departmental procedure, Ministers Ruddock and Vanstone have 

 directly failed each and every one of the 4,700 odd DIMIA staff. 

 

 They have left them out on a limb exposed with poor policy and inadequate 

 and/or outdated advice and instructions.  

 

 I want to move on now, but let me say this: if either of them had any respect for 

 the Westminster system of government they would do the decent thing and 

 resign.  

 

 I suspect the thought has crossed Senator Vanstone’s mind, but Philip Ruddock 

 will be allowed to continue his victory lap until the next election. 

 

 

 The Current Rut in Multicultural Affairs  

 

 As I mentioned above, a minister and a department that fails to adequately deal 

 with these issues will continue to find itself under pressure.  

 

 That is a concern to us all as Australians, but it should also be an additional and 

 significant concern to you as delegates of the Ethnic Communities Councils 

 because it means that both the Minister and the Department’s focus will be 

 devoted elsewhere and not on the important question of what is to be done in 

 Multicultural Affairs. 

 

 For too long, Multicultural Affairs has been ignored by this government. It has 

 been an afterthought, an add-on or an optional extra not significant enough to 

 warrant much initiative or consideration. 

 

 The psychology behind this, I think, is that it was only on attaining office in 1996 

 that John Howard finally realised that multiculturalism is simply indispensable to 

 Australia.  

 

 You see put simply, multiculturalism is a policy with the twin aims of, first, 

 assisting in settlement services for migrants, and second, assisting the wider 

 community in promoting harmony.  

 

 That is not something we should be afraid of advocating. 

 They are the primary aims and elemental drive of the policy’s existence, and 

 have been so since the late Al Grassby first sought to define the term for 

 Australia in 1973. 

 

 Well, if the Liberal Party is hung up on an internal debate on multiculturalism, that 

 is their problem. I will leave John Howard to duke it out with Malcolm Fraser on 

 that. 

 

 For the rest of us out here in the real world, we can no longer let ourselves be 

 held back by the Liberal Party’s internal difficulties. 

 

 Let me make the distinction clear: Labor is proud of its efforts at promoting 

 multiculturalism. We are proud of our achievements, and we have no problem 

 with unambigously supporting this policy. 

 

 As Al Grassby said: "My personal ambition is that Australians of all backgrounds 

 will always be proud before the world to say in whatever accents, 'I am an 

 Australian'. " 

 

 Who could argue with that? 

 

 Trouble on the Horizon 

 

 I want to briefly address a couple of issues of concern that I know many of you 

 have in relation to new changes in the way the multicultural affairs portfolio is run. 

 

 As you are aware, the 2005-06 Federal Budget contains no new significant boost 

 for settlement services and fails again to address the challenges to 

 multiculturalism in Australia.  

 

 However, the way Migrant Resource Centres and the Community Settlement 

 Services Scheme  (CSSS)  are currently funded is the subject of a discussion 

 paper. 

 

 The scheme basically removes core-funding for Migrant Resource Centres and 

 funding from the present Community Settlement Services Scheme system and 

 instead provides for a new combined Settlement Grants funding pool. 

 

 Labor is concerned the new scheme may be used to “wind down” the MRC’s, by 

 gradually removing and redirecting their funding. 

 

 The discussion paper also includes under “activities that will not be funded 

 under the program”:  

 â¢ provision of migration advice.   

 â¢ provision of professional translating or interpreting services.  

 

 Labor is also concerned that these changes will leave gaps in services that may 

 adversely affect the migrant community. 

 

 Migrant Resource Centres offer a dedicated, personalised service for new 

 migrants. When they are run well, no other agency performs the “service hub” 

 role that these centres do. 

 

 We will be carefully scruitinising the government's handling of the Settlement 

 Services grants program, and the outcome of the Discussion Paper process. 

 

 Finally, and I’m concious time is short, I want to point out to you all how 

 dissapointed Labor is about the way mainstreaming is being conducted without a 

 proper process of accountability. 

 

 The idea of an annual access and equity report is so that DIMIA can provide an 

 assessment of how each department or agency is meeting its requirements 

 under the Howard government’s Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse 

 Society. 

 

 That is all good in theory but, like so much of the Howard government, this is a 

 policy driven solely by the minister’s hot air. Let us have a look at the executive 

 summary. On page 9, over the page where the minister has signed off, it says: 

 

 DIMIA does not verify the accuracy of reported information or the scope of its 

 coverage. 

 The minister has delivered us a weak access and equity reporting system, at the 

 very time we are undergoing a mainstreaming process of farming services away 

 from DIMIA. 

 

 Labor thinks its absolutely crucial that the effects of mainstreaming are monitored 

 to ensure success, but this reporting system is so weak that it requires self-selection for all agencies concerned, and they do not seem to be able to give 

 themselves a 100 per cent tick, even under that process.  

 

 It’s so weak, not even the department can bring itself to stand by the 

 assessments.  

 

 Thirty per cent of agencies failed to bother with a reply, and, of those that did, 

 more than half failed, even on their own self-selected evidence, to meet the 

 principles of the charter.  

 

 I understand that Charter is under review. I have a message for the Howard 

 Government and that is this: don’t stop there Minister. 

 Review and fix the accountability measures because if you aren’t monitoring the 

 effects of mainstreaming properly you will place the quality of results delivered by 

 settlement services under threat. 

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, I am not here to speak to you today about the virtues and 

 benefits of Australian multiculturalism, because here I know I am preaching to the 

 converted.   

 

 Multiculturalism makes everyone a stakeholder in the great Australian 

 community. It says: ‘we are all in this together and we can make it work’. 

 

 We don't have the problems of  Europe where if you take Germany or Holland for 

 example, there is either a perception that migrant communities are not 

 participating from the host country, or alternatively, the perception from migrant 

 communities that they are locked out from participation. 

 

 Our society is a great society because Australia long ago anticipated the need to 

 deal with mass migration from different cultures.  

 

 All of us must play a stronger role in protecting this great legacy of Whitlam and 

 Grassby, Galbally and Fraser, Hawke and Keating. 

 

 We cannot afford to let this legacy slip away from us by staying silent on 

 multicultural affairs. 

 

 Thank you.
