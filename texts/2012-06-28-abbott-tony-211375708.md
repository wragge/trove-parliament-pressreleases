 Leader of the Opposition's Transcript - Joint Press  Conference, Parliament House June 28, 2012 Subjects: Border protection.

 EO&E..............................................................................................................................................................

 TONY ABBOTT:

 As we meet it’s obvious that the Senate is going to vote against the Government’s Malaysia people swap legislation. This  is exactly what was predicted last night when the Government failed to support legislation based on what was common  ground between both the Government and the Opposition. I very much regret that after 24 hours of impassioned, sincere  and, at times very moving debate, the Parliament has come to this deeply unsatisfactory pass. We have not a solution but  a stalemate and I think the Australian public are entitled to feel badly let down by the Government and by the system on  occasions such as this.

 The Coalition did again in the Senate today try to break the deadlock by negotiating with the Greens to support our  legislation. Scott will have more to say about this in a moment. My understanding is that the Greens weren’t, in the end,  prepared to support our legislation because even with the additional safeguards that we were prepared to offer, even with  the very substantial increase in the refugee and humanitarian intake that we were prepared to offer, they, in the end,  weren’t prepared to contemplate any offshore processing at all.

 So with this deadlock in the Parliament at this time, the Prime Minister goes into the parliamentary recess without an  effective policy, and the boats keep coming. The flow just gets bigger every day it seems right now. I think the Prime  Minister can either do nothing for six weeks, or do something over the break and what I urge upon the Prime Minister is to  pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and begin the process of reopening the detention centre, the processing  centre there. That, we believe, is doable, even under the existing legislation. But if the Government believes that  legislation is necessary to establish its validity beyond any doubt, we will certainly support legislation when the Parliament  comes back in August, to put it beyond legal doubt. In fact, there is a bill on the books right now, the Member for Cook  Scott Morrison’s bill, which would do precisely this.

 The problem, if nothing is done now except more blame-gaming by the Government, is that the Australian people would  be entitled to conclude that the only way to stop the boats is to change the Government.

 Now, again I say that I believe the Coalition did make a very substantial concession yesterday. It is a big thing to offer to  increase the refugee and humanitarian intake by over 50 per cent, which is what we did yesterday. We did it in good faith,  in order to try to get a deal from the crossbenches to support legislation based on what I believe is the common ground  across the vast majority of members of this Parliament, but, alas, it was not to be.

 So I do call on the Prime Minister, I do call on the Prime Minister to try to bring something from the disasters at sea this  week and the current stalemate in the Parliament, start the process of getting the Nauru centre up and running and if there  is need for legislation, she will get that legislation once the Parliament comes back in August.

 Scott?

 Tony Abbott Federal Member for Warringah | Leader of the Opposition

 SCOTT MORRISON:

 Thank you Tony and obviously in addition to that the Prime Minister tomorrow can reintroduce temporary protection visas.  She can do that tomorrow. That requires no legislation, as does the process of starting the reopening of Nauru. She could  also increase the integrity of our assessment system by removing the benefit of the doubt under Section 91W, for those  who we reasonably believe to have discarded their documents. She could do that tomorrow, and of course if this  government had the will, they could turn back boats where it was safe to do so. Today, in the Senate, in our discussions  with the Greens, there was a motion, a second reading amendment, that was put forward by the Greens. That amendment  did a number of things and we were prepared to support that amendment in the Senate, providing the Greens were  prepared to support our amendment. That included not only the increase in the refugee intake from 13,750 to 20,000. It  also included an immediate increase in funding to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees of $10 million to  boost the capacity of refugee status determination assessments in Malaysia and Indonesia. The multi-party committee  was part of that process.

 There was also another issue that I had highlighted in a press conference earlier today and that is the need for urgent and  direct discussions at a ministerial level between Senator Carr and Minister Clare with their counterparts in Indonesia to  look at every inch and every aspect of the agreements we have and the protocols we have for dealing with things at sea,  and where further resources are required to deal with issues at sea then let’s support that. That’s something we still  strongly support.

 As Tony said, there is a bill on the notice paper. Tonight, that bill could be voted on if the Government wished to bring that  bill on. There is an understanding between the Opposition and the Government this evening in relation to another bill that  will come back to the House, that there would be no extraordinary motions put. But if the Government chose to bring that  bill on tonight then there could be a vote on that tonight, but that would be a matter for the Government.

 QUESTION:

 Mr Abbott, you say that Australians are entitled to feel let down by the Government and the system. Your colleagues now  have six weeks to go back and spend their time in their electorates where, presumably, people will ask them why  Parliament couldn’t get a solution. What will you advise your MPs to be saying to people who ask them that?

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Well, I will be saying what I’ve always said: that the policies that will stop the boats are the policies that did stop the boats  and that’s precisely what the Coalition put on the table. We weren’t demanding that the Government reintroduce  temporary protection visas. We weren’t demanding that the Government turn boats around if it’s safe to do so. We were  simply saying there is common ground between us on the desirability of offshore processing. We both support offshore  processing at countries which have signed the UN convention. Let’s get that and go forward on that basis.

 Now, John Howard, who funnily enough was the last Prime Minister to actually stop the boats, had a very simple dictum.  He said, ‘get what you can from the Parliament. Don’t ask the Parliament to give you what it won’t give you. Get what you  can from the Parliament and make the most of that’. Unfortunately this Prime Minister, who has had, I regret to say, every  position on border protection except one that will actually work and now has a position that simply won’t pass the 

 Parliament, not now, not ever, has neglected that common sense approach. Phil?

 QUESTION:

 [Inaudible] last 24 hours and Mr Morrison also, have either of you had a direct conversation with, you, Mr Abbott with Ms  Gillard or, you, Mr Bowen in your case?

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Well I attempted to call the Prime Minister yesterday at about one o’clock and she was unable to take the call so I had a  brief conversation with her chief of staff, indicated that we were intending to bring some legislation in and since then  there’s been no attempt by the Prime Minister to speak to me.

 QUESTION:

 And you Mr Morrison?

 SCOTT MORRISON:

 Mr Bowen and I had a polite conversation today in between interviews. That’s the only way you could describe it as we  moved around interviews this morning.

 QUESTION:

 Mr Abbott, you supported the multi-party committee. During the six week break, will you have your senior frontbenchers  engage in that multi-party group in a sincere way?

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Well what we’ve indicated is that as a way of breaking the deadlock we were happy to see this committee established.  Now, unfortunately the deadlock isn’t broken. It isn’t broken. Now, Scott will gladly talk to people who want to talk to him.  I’m happy to talk to people who want to talk to me, but I just want to make it absolutely crystal clear: the Coalition doesn’t  support Malaysia and won’t support the Malaysia people swap. We just won’t. As I keep saying until I’m blue in the face: it  is a dud deal for Australia and a cruel deal for boat people. We have always supported offshore processing but it’s been  processing with protections. We’ve been absolutely consistent on this point all the way through since 2001 and it’s  interesting that I understand Section 198 of the Act, which the Government wants to strip out as part of its Malaysia  people swap, was actually put in, in part, at least, to accommodate the concerns of the then leader of the opposition, Mr  Beazley.

 QUESTION:

 In the discussions yesterday between Judi Moylan and the Greens, there seems to be some debate as to whether the  Greens had a view on offshore processing. Indeed, I think it went so far as they were almost open to it. What’s your  understanding of what actually happened between Judi Moylan and the Greens, specifically on offshore processing?

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Well I don’t want to go into the detail of who said what to whom and exactly what impression was left with people but what  we were trying to do as a Coalition was give a very substantial concession in terms of a roughly 50 per cent increase in  the refugee and humanitarian intake in order to get the Greens to support a humane form of offshore processing. Now we  know the Greens have been long concerned about what they think is the niggardly level of refugee and humanitarian entry  into this country. We were prepared to offer them a very substantial increase in order to get them over the line on offshore  processing but unfortunately we weren’t able to do that today.

 SCOTT MORRISON:

 Can I just add to that Tony? That offer was made again today between myself and Senator Hanson-Young and that offer  after she consulted with her colleagues was flatly rejected.

 QUESTION:

 Did detect any enthusiasm during those discussions yesterday and that it sort of died when it went back to the Greens  party room?

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 You’d have to ask that question to Senator Hanson-Young about what happens in her own party room. All I can tell you is  the Greens have been enthusiastic about increasing the intake to 20,000 and the other measures they put in their  amendment, their second reading amendment today. So, I am surprised that there was an opportunity for there to have  been agreement on that today and that was rejected by the Greens. So our policies are those we took to the last election.

 QUESTION: 

 [Inaudible] are always talking about a regional solution and wouldn't agree to an offshore processing arrangement where  people arrived in one place and were then taken somewhere else. Whereas at the same time the people party to those  negotiations with the Greens maintain they were very close to supporting it.

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 There was a direct discussion about that amendment and the proposal about increasing the intake to 20,000 was in return  for getting support for that amendment. They were the things being discussed. Regional solutions and things of that  nature, they're actually our policy now so they weren't the subject of those discussions.

 QUESTION:

 In your view, Sarah Hanson-Young indicated to you in some way she was open to supporting it?

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 As Tony said, we’re not going to go into the entrails of the discussions because there's been many over the last few days.  All I can say is the Greens are on record for supporting an increase of the refugee and humanitarian intake to 20,000. The  Coalition offered to support that today and a range of other measures as we did yesterday and when that was put to the  party room I understand in the Greens, the answer that came back from the Greens to us was no.

 QUESTION: 

 So are you happy for your MPs who attended that meeting yesterday who are keen to work on a bipartisan response with  MPs across the Parliament to keep meeting in the interim and hopefully come up with something that might be new?

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, obviously people are entitled to meet with whomsoever they want and as is well known, members of Parliament are  always fraternising with one another across the party divides, in airport lounges, at functions in the Parliament,  parliamentary friendship occasions and so on but the Coalition will never support Malaysia. Full stop. End of story. The  Malaysian people swap will never be supported by the Coalition and just for clarity let me say that I use ‘Malaysia’ as  shorthand. I have a great deal of respect for Malaysia. I just acknowledge that their standards are not our standards. Their  system is not our system and I believe that once people have come into Australia's care and control, we are obliged to  look after them and to treat them in accordance with our standards, not other country's standards.

 QUESTION:

 Mr Abbott, you said you’ve been consistent on protections for asylum seekers being processed overseas. When did you  decide that a UNHCR signatory had to be the guideline for acceptance for offshore processing?

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Well, the fact of the matter, Dennis, is that the centres in Nauru and Manus were run by Australians in accordance with  Australian standards. They were effectively operating under that rule even prior to the time that that Nauru acceded to the  UN convention. So the UN convention was, I think, a formality in respect of Nauru but nevertheless an important one and  Scott and I were delighted when on our visit to Nauru in the middle of last year the Nauruan Government indicated a  willingness to rapidly accede to the UN convention.

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 Just to give you a timeline on it, Dennis, that was first articulated by the Coalition after the Government said they wanted  to abolish section 198A of the Migration Act. So they were the legally binding provisions that gave protections to people  offshore. When the Government wanted to remove those, our argument was you had to replace them with something. So  when Tony and I and Senator Brandis and Julie Bishop were briefed by the Government's own officials and we asked  them about what was an objective litmus test for protections being in place, they confirmed that the only one that was out  there was that refugee convention.

 QUESTION:

 Mr Abbott do you think that the Prime Minister has during the last 48 hours acted in such a way where she actually wants  to negotiate in good faith for a political outcome?

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Look, I’m not going to accuse the Prime Minister of bad faith. I think it is far too easy to bandy around accusations about  faith and I think we politicians tend to do it too often. But surely, some progress is better than no progress and given that  the Prime Minister was never going to get her preferred option from the Parliament, a preferred option that she would  herself never have supported even 12 months ago, but nevertheless given that she was never going to get her preferred  option from the Parliament, surely she should have taken what she could get from the Parliament, which was clear  legislative backing for sending illegal maritime arrivals to any of the 148 countries in the world that have signed the UN  convention, including Nauru and PNG where she claims she wants to do a deal.

 So I’m disappointed. I would, as I said, be very reluctant to accuse the Prime Minister of bad faith but certainly what we  have seen on display is pride and stubbornness and that is, I think, very disappointing. At the end of the day, the Prime  Minister now can either do nothing and say it's all someone else's fault or she can do something and what she should do  over the next six weeks is get cracking with trying to reopen these processing centres in Nauru and at Manus Island and  the legislative backing will be there if she needs extra legislative backing and if she’s not prepared to do that, I fear the  Australian public will conclude that the only way to stop the boats is to change the government.
