 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 RUDDOCK FOLLOWS LABOR’S LEAD

 Minister Ruddock has once again followed Labor’s lead with today’s announcement of changes to immigration detention centres, but he needs to go much further.

 I support the Minister’s decision to mothball the centre at the RAAF Curtin base in Western Australia and open the new purpose-built facility, Baxter, near Port Augusta in South Australia.  The Curtin centre was old, dilapidated and never intended for the long-term processing of asylum seekers.

 I also support the Minister’s decision to scale back Woomera’s capacity.  However, it does not go far enough.  I call upon the Minister to go the next step, to have the courage to accept the recommendations of his own advisory group, endorsed by the ALP, and fully mothball Woomera by moving detainees to more appropriate facilities and locations.

 The future of the alternative detention trial in Woomera township is another issue that needs to be addressed.  This trial involved 25 women and children living in former Defence housing under ACM supervision.  It is an excellent experiment that should be expanded.

 Despite the closure of Curtin and the reduction in capacity of Woomera, two new centres are to be opened or constructed with the plans for Baxter and Darwin.  With this increase in onshore capacity, can the Minister really keep a straight face and continue to insist that the ‘Pacific Solution’ is working?
