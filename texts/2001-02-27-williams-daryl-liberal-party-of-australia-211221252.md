 LABOR AND DEMOCRATS UNDERMINE TRIBUNAL REFORM

 Labor and the Democrats last night blocked the passage of the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2000 through the Senate.

 The Bill aims to replace slow, legalistic and unnecessarily adversarial and expensive merits review with a cheaper, more accessible system.

 The ART would replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Migration Review Tribunal and provide a single, independent tribunal to review administrative decisions on their merits.

 Labor and the Democrats have not supported this positive reform, despite saying they support merging the existing separate tribunals into one body.

 This leaves the existing tribunals in limbo and the likelihood of the ART being established this year is rapidly receding.

 The Government has not shut the door on the possibility of a compromise agreement being reached with either Labor or the Democrats. We have offered to make significant amendments to the Bill to satisfy their concerns.

 However, we are not prepared to put the operation and workability of the existing tribunals at risk. If we cannot reach agreement very soon, the Government will have to make substantive appointments and reappointments in order to restore certainty to the existing tribunals.

 Of course, it would be preferable to set up the ART. The proposed Tribunal will deliver, more effectively than the present system, the principal objectives of every

 merits review system: administrative justice to individuals, government accountability and a high standard of government decision-making.

 It is a shame Labor and the Democrats do not appear to support the same ideals.
