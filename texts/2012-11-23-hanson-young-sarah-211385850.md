 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 23 November 2012   

 A chorus of support for refugee healthcare  panel   

 A chorus of health industry bodies and human rights experts have supported the Greens  move to establish an independent healthcare oversight panel at a hearing today.   

 “The overwhelming support that we have heard today for our healthcare oversight panel  shows just how concerning the Government’s treatment of refugees really is,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “We have seen peak medical bodies, like the Australian Medical Association and the Royal  Australian College of Physicians, support the Greens push for adequate healthcare oversight  for refugees simply because it is the right thing to do.   

 “With so many groups recognising that something must be done, it is obviously time to act  and I call on my Parliamentary colleagues to support the bill.   

 “If Australia is going to maintain its inhumane and illegal offshore detention network, at the  very least we need an independent panel of experts to oversee detainees’ healthcare and  report back to parliament.   

 “The list of groups who support the Greens’ bill is long but the most important thing is for  people to understand that there is support for this because, as Amnesty International says,  the current situation is unacceptable.”
