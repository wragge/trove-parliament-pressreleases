  Senator Andrew Bartlett 

  Australian Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson 

  R!efugee death- 

  Government’s Immigration Policies destroying lives’ 

  The Australian Democrats have expressed their sorrow at the tragic and   unnecessary death of Mr Shahraz Kayani-a husband and father of three   daughters-who had been residing in Australia as a refugee. 

  Democrat’s spokesperson on Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said Mr Kayani’s death was a   complete tragedy, particularly as his protest and resultant death were totally avoidable. 

  “The Australian Government has instigated practices, which are unprecedented in our migratioli   history and will leave a scar on the (country and these people for many years to come,” said   Senator Bartlett. 

  “Regrettably Mr Kayani resorted to (3 desperate protest over the Federal Government’s refusal io   allow his wife and three daughters to immigrate to Australia, simply because one of his childreri   had a form of cerebral palsy. 

  “This is more than the death of a hciIsband and father; it is also the death of a family. The   Government’s immigration policies (at-8 destroying lives,” said Senator Bartlett. 

  “It is a sad and tragic indictment of the Government’s lack of compassion and understanding of the   realities, pressures and emotions experienced by thousands of hopeful, yet despairing people. 

  “They are people, human beings: fathers, husbands, mothers, wives, children, sons and   daughters-many of whom have suffered intolerably under oppressive regimes-who at great peril   to themselves and their families have ‘escaped’ to Australia in search of new beginnings. 

  “But upon their arrival in Australia they are known as illegal immigrants, queue-jumpers and   detainees, irrespective of their circumstances. 

  “To add insult to injury, the Governrnent then makes decisions that see these people separatecl   from their families for long periods of time-whether this is in the area of visitors, spouse familp   reunion, refugee or business visas. 

  “Overseas visitors applying to come to Australia from such countries as the Philippines. Fiji, India   and Lebanon are subjected to closer scrutiny than those applying from England, Canada and   Europe. 

  “This means that those intending to visit their families are prevented from doing so and are oftc’n   subjected to rigorous assessment, which leads to the conclusion that their visit is not genuine. This   assessment is based on their country of origin, ethnicity, gender and age. 

  “We have over 50,000 people who have breached the terms of their visas at any one time in   Australia. And none of these are subjected to the same mandatory ‘detention,” Senator Bartlett   concluded.
