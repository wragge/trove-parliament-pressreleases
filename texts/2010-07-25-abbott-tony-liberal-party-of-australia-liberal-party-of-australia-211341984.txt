 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH 

 Real Action on Sustainable Population Growth 

 25/07/10  

 Australia needs a population that our services can satisfy, our infrastructure can  support, our environment can sustain, our society can embrace, and our economy can  employ. 

 Australia's population growth since World War II has helped create the prosperity we  now enjoy. Successive waves of post-war migration have expanded our capacity as a  nation. 

 Under the Howard Government, our immigration programme enjoyed support from a  majority of Australians who were confident that the programme was fair, competently  administered, and delivering benefits to the entire community. 

 Under Labor, migration-fuelled population growth has caused Australians to become  increasingly concerned, and to lose confidence in our broader immigration  programme. 

 The hopeless failure of Labor’s border protection regime has further eroded  community trust. 

 Under Labor, net overseas migration has risen to 300,000 people per year, against a  long run average of around 140,000 per year. 

 At this rate Australia’s population would reach 42.3 million people by 2050,  significantly above the earlier Intergenerational Report II (IGR) forecast of 36  million. 

 As a result, the quality of life for Australians living in our major urban areas today is  under great pressure. 

 Fuelling population growth today must not rob future generations of the quality of life  and opportunities we currently enjoy. That is what sustainability is all about. 

 On the eve of an election, Labor politicians have suddenly started to say they no  longer believe in a “big Australia” - while cynically trying to put off any decisions on  these issues until after the election. 

 While Labor may have changed its rhetoric under its new leader, Labor’s policies on  immigration or population have not changed. 

 The Coalition believes it is necessary to ease population growth to deliver more  sustainable population levels, based on our present and future capacity, so that our  infrastructure, services and environment can catch up.    

 Unlike Labor, the Coalition’s population and immigration policy is clear. 

 The Coalition will: 

 1. Establish ‘Guard Rails’ for Population Growth  

 The Coalition will set clear parameters for population growth by tasking a renamed  Productivity and Sustainability Commission to advise on population growth bands  that it considers are sustainable. 

 This recommendation will provide a Coalition Government with the expert advice  necessary to establish the framework for setting migration programmes. 

 2. Take Real Action on Immigration  

 The Coalition will reduce Australia’s annual rate of population growth from more  than 2 per cent under Labor, to our historical long-run average of 1.4 per cent within  our first term. 

 This will require reducing our annual rate of net overseas migration from 298,924 in  2008/09 to no more than 170,000 per year by the end of our first term. 

 3. Make a Clear Commitment to Skills Migration and Regional Australia.  

 The Coalition will ensure that two-thirds of our permanent migration programme will  be for the purposes of skilled migration. 

 A Coalition Government will also quarantine the level of employer nominated skills  migration and 457 temporary business visas to at least the levels it inherits. In  addition, the Coalition will liberalise arrangements for temporary business visas  (457s) subject to clear standards, to make them more accessible to business, especially  small businesses, and business in regional areas, with proven skills shortage needs. 

 To address the skills needs of regional areas and small business, the Coalition will  encourage the settlement on either a temporary or permanent basis of new arrivals in  regional and rural areas. 

 States such as Queensland and Western Australia will be afforded a high priority for  permanent and temporary skilled visa applications.  

 A Coalition Government would also seek to resettle more entrants from our refugee  and humanitarian programme in regional areas, where these resettlement programmes  have proved to be highly successful. 

 4. Establish A Clear and Consultative Process to Restore Control  

 The Coalition will produce a White Paper on immigration that will reframe the  structure and composition of Australia’s immigration programme to address the  policy challenges of sustainable population growth. 

 A Discussion Paper will be released by the end of 2010, with a final paper to be  completed by the Coalition’s first Budget in May 2011. This will help inform the  composition of the 2011-12 migration programme. 

 Australians want their government to take control of population and immigration  policies to restore confidence and ensure our immigration and population levels are  sustainable and in the national interest. 

 The Coalition’s plan for Real Action on Sustainable Population Growth will restore  confidence and re-establish consensus on the benefits of our immigration programme.
