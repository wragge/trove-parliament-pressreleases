 MEDIA RELEASE    

 

 Wednesday 10 June 2015    

 

 Government must give full account of boat turn back and payments    

 The Australian Greens have demanded answers today over reports from an Indonesian  Police Chief that Australian officials paid thousands of dollars to the crew  of an asylum seeking boat to turn around.    

 "The Government must give a full account of what has occurred here. No excuses for  secrecy and cover-up will wash this time," Greens spokesperson for immigration Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “If these claims prove to be correct then the Australian government is directly financing  crews on asylum seeker boats not to come to Australia.  If true, this would be simply  unprecedented and totally unacceptable. Minister Dutton must come clean on whether  this incident occurred and who authorised it.    

 “Paying people to stay away from Australia smacks of hypocrisy and throws into  question the operations of Australia’s border control authorities    

 “You have to wonder what else the immigration department is hiding from the Australian  people. The cloud of secrecy in relation to the governments asylum seeker policies  needs to be lifted and a thorough investigation into payments to crews on asylum seeker  boats needs to take place
