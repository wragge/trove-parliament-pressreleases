 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION   

 TRANSCRIPT 0F DOORSTOP - PERTH, FRIDAY, 4 JULY 2003   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: Medicare; Asylum seekers; Telstra; Wilson Tuckey   

 CREAN: This is another day in the continuing campaign to restore bulk  billing and to save Medicare.  Under the Howard Government, bulk billing has  dropped in every one of the years that they have been in office, and the dramatic  decline has been in the past three years.   

 Here in Western Australia there has been a 15% decline in bulk billing rates in just  the last three years, and it will continue to get worse.  Even after the Government  announced its so-called rescue package, bulk billing rates fell again.   

 And that is because the Government isn’t serious about restoring bulk billing and  saving Medicare.  It has offered a measly increase to the patient rebate, but only if  you are concession card holder.  That means anyone who is on an income of over  $32,000 a year - and that is not wealthy by any means - will have to pay to go and  see a doctor.  They have already paid through their Medicare levy.  John Howard  wants them to pay again.     

 Labor’s plan, the plan that I announced in my Budget Speech in Reply, will lift the  patient rebate significantly across the board for those doctors that bulk bill, and it  will also target those areas that have had a bigger decline in bulk billing.  In  Sharryn’s electorate, the decline has been greater than the State average and so,  therefore, the additional incentive payment can work to greater advantage out here.    

 What is very interesting about the campaign today is that you can see the workforce  from Skipper’s Transport involving themselves in the campaign.  There are many  people opposed to Medicare disappearing but collectively we can turn that  opposition to defeating the Government’s plans.  If we work together, not just to  oppose what the Government is doing, we can not only defeat their proposals to  destroy Medicare, we can actually save it - save it by implementing Labor’s plan.   

 This is an important community contribution.  People and families need to know that  when they get sick they can afford to go to a doctor.  Under John Howard that won’t

 happen.  Affordability of health will just disappear.  That is not an Australia I want to  see.  I want to see an Australia in which - whilst we would encourage people to be  healthy - we know that when they get sick, they can afford medical treatment.   

 This is another day in the campaign to save Medicare, another day in the campaign  to defeat John Howard’s proposals, another day in the campaign to do the right  thing  by Australian families and keep what they’ve paid for - keep bulk billing and  keep Medicare.   

 JOURNALIST: What about private health cover?   

 CREAN: We haven’t indicated any change in terms of private health cover  but, more importantly, I have signalled a very strong commitment to retain private  health insurance.     

 But just as we showed an ability in the Budget to rearrange existing expenditures to  actually save Medicare and bulk billing, of course we have got to continue to look at  how the health dollars are spent.  The Commonwealth Government through your  taxes is spending $35 billion a year on health.  You’d think that if they were  spending that amount of money, you could save Medicare.   

 But what we have got to do is to continually look at better ways of spending the  health dollar, to not only address bulk billing but to also address those waiting lists  in public hospitals.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, you’ve said that you will reallocate the private health  insurance rebate.  How will that be done?  What will you do?   

 CREAN: What I have said is that we will be continually looking at the  health budget expenditure.  I have made no statement in terms of what we will do  regarding private health insurance.  What I have made is an absolute commitment  to save Medicare and restore bulk billing without touching it one bit.   

 JOURNALIST: How would you like to see the health dollar spent, then?   

 CREAN: Well, I want to see it spent for the betterment of Australian  families.  I want to see them to be able to get a doctor that bulk bills, and I want to  see them be able to get free treatment in a public hospital.  That was the contract  that Australians signed up for when they paid their 1.5 Medicare Levy.  It is the  contract that John Howard said he would keep.  Now he has torn it up.  I am not  going to let him tear it up.     

 But, significantly, I’ve shown a way in which we can reinforce that contract and  deliver on it.  It can be done by reordering the priorities within the Budget.  I’ve  shown how it can be done.  Now we have to campaign around it.

 JOURNALIST: Can I ask you about asylum seekers and the revelations that the  latest boatload were actually inside the migration zone - what was your reaction to  that?   

 CREAN: Well, my reaction in the first instance is, how did the boat get so  close?  It wouldn’t have happened had there been a Coastguard, and I have been  calling for a Coastguard.  We need a cop on the beat to patrol our borders, to stop  the gun runners, to stop the people smugglers, to stop the drug runners, to protect  our fisheries - not a Navy as a defence mechanism - but a police force, a policing  authority, an enforcement authority.   

 JOURNALIST: But what do you make of this information …   

 CREAN: Well, hang on, you’ve asked me the question.  I’m saying that  had a Coastguard been in place, the boat wouldn’t have gotten through.  But on the  information that we now know - that the boat was in territorial waters - this is  another example of Government deceit.  Yesterday, the Government said it wasn’t in  territorial waters and that is why they had returned it to Christmas Island.  They  deceived on the Kids Overboard; they’re still deceiving on their border protection  policy.   

 JOURNALIST: [inaudible] for the Federal Government one year out from a poll?   

 CREAN: Look, it’s a demonstration that their border protection policy isn’t  working, and they should admit it and they should adopt my policy for a Coastguard.   That is what they should do.  They’re not only forgetting Western Australia, they’re  forgetting all of Australia.  I mean we’ve got 30,000 km of coastline.  Any sensible  country would have a cop on the beat.  The Americans do; we should.  And Labor  will introduce one.   

 JOURNALIST: Should they have been taken to Christmas Island, in your view?   

 CREAN: The reality is that these people will have rights.  Their rights are  determined by where they land, but the reality is that whether they’re taken to  Christmas Island or not, they will still have those rights because they were detained  in Australian territorial waters.  This shows the stupidity of the Government’s policy -  an inability to stop them getting to the mainland.   

 JOURNALIST: These people were just kilometres from an existing detention  centre.  Don’t you think it’s a rather expensive exercise taking them 1800 km to  Christmas Island?   

 CREAN: Of course it is, and the Government really needs to explain why it  has deceived and why it is wasting money.  But I think the interesting thing in the  case of these asylum seekers is that, because an arrangement is in place with  Vietnam, just as there is with China - arrangements that Labor Governments put in  place - if they are not genuine asylum seekers, they will be returned and the  country has to take them back.

 What we need is a similar arrangement in place with Indonesia, and we haven’t got  it.  And I have been calling for the Government to actually get such an agreement.   Labor demonstrated how we could protect our borders by entering into those  agreements.  This Government just isn’t interested.  It wants to play on the fear of  Australians, but not really deal with the problem in a practical way.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, on another issue, Telstra.  Alby Shultz has said that he  is concerned - a Liberal MP - about the sale of Telstra.  What do you say about  that?   

 CREAN: Well, I’m delighted.  And it is about time that someone in the  Liberal Party had some honesty about this.  But he sends a very strong example, I  think - not just to the Liberal Party, but to the National Party.  It is the National  Party that has sold out on Telstra, but no one is taking any notice of them now  because they have just become a fully paid-up branch of the Liberal Party.  They  have lost their relevance.   

 But Labor will campaign against the further sale of Telstra.  I’m opposed to the  further sale of Telstra, and we will not only vote against it in the Parliament, we will  campaign against it.  Just think of the opportunity in terms of the future  telecommunications technology and development in this country.  We need the  Government ownership to ensure all Australians benefit, not just the wealthy few.   

 JOURNALIST: Just coming back to the health issue, what would you do with this  medical indemnity insurance crisis?    

 CREAN: I certainly would have acted earlier in getting the States together  to fix it.  The States actually came up with a proposal to cap the amounts of money  that could be paid out.  That was a significant start, but that will only translate to  lower premiums if, in fact, you ensure that the capping and the lower costs are  passed on through lower insurance premiums.     

 For that to happen, you need to give more powers to the consumer watchdog, the  ACCC.  Just as the Government gave it powers when it introduced the GST to ensure  prices didn’t go up over 10%, it should be giving powers now to ensure that  premiums don’t rise as a result of the new agreement.   

 JOURNALIST: Would you do that?   

 CREAN: Of course, I would.  I’ve called for it.  I would deliver it - sound  policy, constructive initiatives, and a preparedness to deliver on them.   

 JOURNALIST: Can I ask you about Mr Tuckey’s comments?  You would be  aware that he has made comments about how Aboriginal people handle money.   What do you think of those comments?

 CREAN: Nothing ever surprises me with Wilson Tuckey.  I must say I  haven’t actually seen the comments.  I’d like to see the detail.  But I think it is  terribly important that we address the issue of need in Aboriginal communities.  We  have to ensure that the ability for the communities to take responsibility and to have  assistance in meeting the dreadful issues that they have to face in health in  particular, but also with education, is a decision that we all as a nation have got to  face up to.  And that can only be done by constructive initiatives rather than ones  that seek to denigrate or to put people down.  I don’t believe you ever make  constructive progress by put-downs.  What we need is people actually providing  solutions rather than put-downs.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think there is a problem with the way public money is  administered in the Aboriginal sector?   

 CREAN: I think that the issue of addressing the need is one that we as a  nation have to become better equipped to handle.  There are still problems there.   We have to address it.  As a nation, we have to face up to it.
