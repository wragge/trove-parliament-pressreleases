 07-11-2016 -



 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the off-water



 reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



 The reporting period is from 1 October 2016 to 31 October 2016.



 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration



 authorities.



 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres.



 Three illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. One illegal maritime arrival



 detainee was involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin. Their removal from Australia is



 consistent with Australia's obligations.



 Four illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



 country.



 As at 31 October 2016, there were a total of 872 people in Manus Island RPC and 390 people in Nauru RPC.



 With the opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure



 on those still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



 Of the 1015 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 510 were positive and 505 were



 negative as at 31 October 2016. There were 675 refugees who have been given a positive final determination.



 There were 147 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



 Of the 1195 Current Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 941 were positive and 254



 were negative as at 31 October 2016.
