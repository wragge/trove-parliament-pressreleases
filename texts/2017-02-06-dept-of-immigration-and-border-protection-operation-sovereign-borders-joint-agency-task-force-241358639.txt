 06-02-2017 -



 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the on-water



 reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



 The reporting period is from 1 January 2017 to 31 January 2017.



 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration authorities.



 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres.



 Eight illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. No illegal maritime arrival detainees



 were involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin.



 One illegal maritime arrival transferee voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



 country.



 As at 31 January 2017, there were a total of 861 people in Manus Island RPC and 380 people in Nauru RPC. With



 the opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on



 those still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



 Of the 1015 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 510 were positive and 505 were



 negative as at 31 January 2017. There were 689 refugees who have been given a positive final determination. There



 were 225 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



 Of the 1,204 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 998 were positive and 206 were negative



 as at 31 January 2017.
