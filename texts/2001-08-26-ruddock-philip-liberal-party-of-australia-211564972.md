 Record Applications to the Courts and AAT MPS 126/2001

 Australia is facing a serious problem as the number of appeals to the courts and the AAT reached record levels last financial year the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

 "In the past year, my Department recorded 2,003 new appeals, representing an increase of 26% over the previous year and more than double the 753 appeals in 1995-96," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Of note is an increase of almost 40% in the number of 'first instance' appeals to the Federal Court and a 19% increase in appeals to the Full federal Court. Appeals to the AAT also jumped 11%.

 "We are seeing a growth industry here which largely benefits the legal fraternity and represents a significant cost to the Australian taxpayer because each case costs around $10,000. It also represents a significant cost to the community as a large number of people use the Courts to delay their departure and often work unlawfully in Australia.

 "Others remain in detention while their cases are processed by the Courts and this also represents a considerable expense to the taxpayer," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Over 65% of the appeals to the Federal Court seek review of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal, but less than 1% of those commencing the judicial review process are likely to obtain a visa and be permitted to remain in Australia.

 "It is therefore clear that very many people are using the asylum seeker system and the Courts primarily to delay their departure from Australia and this cannot go on," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Australia's international obligations only require that asylum seekers have access to some review but there is no requirement for them to have access to the many layers of review that are currently available.

 "The Government has proposed legislation - a Privative Clause - to limit judicial review but Labor will not support this move, even though they have a long history of using the mechanism to limit the right of Australian citizens to access judicial review.

 "The Hawke Government inserted a Privative Clause in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 but Labor is now trying to tell us this course of action is unconstitutional.

 "Labor had the solution in 1988 when it came to Australian citizens but is now part of the problem in relation to unlawful arrivals and others trying to extend their stay in Australia," Mr Ruddock said.
