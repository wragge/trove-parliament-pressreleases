 MORE AUSTRALIAN AID FOR RWANDANS

 Australia will provide over $2 million in emergency aid for the victims of the Rwanda  crisis, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today. The  Government has already provided $1.5 million in emergency relief for Rwanda. This  latest package will bring Australian Government assistance for Rwanda to over $3.5  million.

 Mr Bilney said the movement of Rwandans from their homeland was an African  tragedy on an unprecedented scale which demanded a massive response from the  international community.

 “Some thirty per cent of Rwanda’s population have already moved beyond the  country’s borders. Their needs are basic and immediate - for food, water, shelter and  medicines.

 “Another two million people in Rwanda have been displaced from their homes. Their  needs are also for safe haven, food and medical care”, Mr Bilney said.

 The latest advice to the Government, based on first hand assessments from AIDAB and  UN agencies, indicates that cash contributions to agencies already on the ground is, in  the main, the best way of providing help at this stage.

 Mr Bilney said that the largest cash contribution would be provided to the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which is the lead agency in  coordinating all relief efforts.

 Other contributions would be channelled through Australian NGOs on the ground or  with partner agencies working in the field.

 This latest package of assistance includes:

 â¢ $750,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  This cash contribution will help UNHCR to provide air transport, plastic sheeting and  prefabricated warehouses to store essential supplies.

 â¢ $260,000 to the World Food Programme (WFP) to purchase Australian made  communications equipment. WFP has sought funds to purchase Australian made  Codan communications equipment, made in South Australia, to help with food  distribution operations in Rwanda and Tanzania.

 â¢ $350,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide  medicines, sanitation and safe water supplies. It will also support a program to help  reunite families separated by the movement of refugees.

 â¢ $300,000 to UNICEF Australia to provide emergency relief supplies such as  blankets and cooking utensils, in exchange for work to harvest sorghum and bean crops.  UNICEF hopes to encourage Rwandan farmers to harvest these crops in order to obtain 

 seed supplies for the planting season in September.

 â¢ $100,000 worth of Australian made high energy biscuits. AIDAB will release  from its emergency stockpile some 33 metric tonnes of high energy biscuits which  World Vision will use to feed unaccompanied children in and around Kigali.

 â¢ $300,000 to CARE Australia for mobile health teams to provide medical care  for around 400,000 refugees in the Benaco camp in Tanzania.
