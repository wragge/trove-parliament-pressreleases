 Mr Ruddock launches Migration Report Sydney, 3 September 2002

 The Settlement Experiences of New Migrants

 Good morning ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Gary Hardgrave, Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, and other distinguished guests.

 Firstly I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation upon whose land we are standing today.

 I have invited you here to highlight an important new research report entitled "The Settlement Experiences of New Migrants", by Professor Sue Richardson and her colleagues at the National Institute of Labour Studies in South Australia.

 One reason why I applaud Professor Richardson's work is that she is making use of one of the richest sources of information about migration - my department's longitudinal survey of immigrants to Australia.

 The longitudinal survey is a remarkable project that we can rightly claim is ahead of the rest of the world. In fact the British home office has recently sought the advice of my department in helping them set up a similar survey.

 The survey contains the responses of a representative group of migrants to more than 300 questions. These questions cover a wide field. Essentially, they can be divided into two types:

 those that ask about the economic welfare of the migrants; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» those that ask about their social welfare. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In August last year I had the pleasure of launching Sue Richardson's report entitled "The Labour Force Experiences of New Migrants" which examined the economic outcomes of migrants based on the longitudinal survey.

 That report told a very positive story about how new migrants were quickly finding good, well paid jobs in which they were putting their qualifications and skills straight to work.

 Today, I take equal pleasure in launching this companion volume, which examines the social and settlement experiences of new migrants.

 This report draws upon the wealth of information that new migrants have given us about the many aspects of their settlement in this country.

 As well as providing a fascinating insight into the process of migration, this information is important in confirming the critical nation- building role of immigration in Australia. This nation-building role is played out along several dimensions.

 Firstly there is the economic dimension that is often at the forefront of the immigration debate. This includes issues such as:

 the size of the migration program; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» the number of skilled migrants; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» the net benefit to the budget; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» the dollar value of migration to the economy. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 These are of course very important issues. The fact is that in economic terms, immigration, as it is currently managed, is very good for Australia's economy

 Then there is the demographic dimension. And here, let me make a simple and unequivocal statement: Australia needs a properly managed migration program to prevent the population of this country from starting to fall in about thirty years time from now, and then go on falling, as it becomes older and less fertile.

 It is hard to exaggerate the social and economic implications of this scenario or the critical role that immigration can play in preventing it becoming

 a reality.

 Humanitarian resettlement is a third dimension of immigration. We have one of the largest offshore humanitarian resettlement programs in the world. It provides the best way of helping people who are in serious humanitarian difficulties and who need resettlement.

 Over the years, we have brought to this country hundreds of thousands of refugees and people in need of humanitarian resettlement via the humanitarian program. This is an effort of which we can all be proud.

 And then there is the global dimension.

 We are a numerically small country that is geographically remote. Migration is one of the critical connections that we forge with other countries in order to play our full role as a citizen of the world.

 Migration, therefore, has a very significant trade, cultural and geopolitical role. But migrants are not numbers or economic units or demographic building blocks, important as these dimensions of migration may be.

 Migrants are people - people who will become part of our society - people whose personal and social experiences are as important as their economic and demographic impacts.

 That is why I welcome Professor Richardson's report, which fills a very important gap in our understanding of this human and social dimension.

 We have one of the best migration programs in the world that targets the kind of migrants Australia needs, and one of the best humanitarian programs in the world that identifies those in most need of our help. But our job is only half done if we ignore how these migrants fare once they get to Australia.

 The other half of our task is to ensure that they settle quickly and become full and productive members of Australian society. We therefore need to know about the settlement experiences of these migrants:

 How easy is it for them to find a house and a job? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Does Australia live up to their expectations? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Do they like it? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Do they want to become Australians themselves? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 What attracted them to Australia and why did they decide to settle in a particular state or territory? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Perhaps most importantly, do they intend to stay and would they recommend the move to their friends and colleagues back home? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The best way to find these things out is to ask the migrants themselves. This is, of course, not a foolproof approach. How many of us, for example, would be able to account for our household expenditure at the drop of a hat?

 It is also possible that the migrants interviewed six months after arrival might still be in a "honeymoon" mood. So, valuable as it is, this study needs to be followed up with a look at migrant experiences once they have been here a little longer - and in a moment I will mention further work on this very issue.

 Without, I hope, stealing Professor Richardson's thunder, I'd like to point to some of the key insights the report contains.

 Ninety per cent of migrants interviewed in the survey six months after arrival were very happy with their decision to migrate. Interestingly, the most satisfied were from the most well-off and the least well off groups - that is business migrants and humanitarian program entrants.

 The satisfaction of humanitarian migrants with their new life in Australia is reflected in the fact that almost 100 per cent of them intended to become citizens as soon as they were eligible, compared with 80 per cent of all other migrants. As well as the significant group who came here to marry Australians, migrants were also attracted to Australia by long term, inter-generational factors:

 a better future for the family; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» a better lifestyle; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» the beauty of the Australian environment; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» our climate. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Conversely, very few of the migrants interviewed came here because they disliked their life in their home country or because they were unemployed or were not satisfied with their careers.

 In other words, we don't target people who can't succeed in their own countries:

 We attract those who have established themselves at home but have the enterprise and initiative to seek a better life in Australia. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 We also take people who are about 10 per cent healthier that the Australian average, which shouldn't surprise us as all migrants have to pass a thorough medical examination before being granted a visa;

 I am also pleased to learn that only around three per cent of those interviewed cited racism as an aspect of Australia that they disliked. I find this particularly heartening given that about one third of the migration intake comes from Asia and 15 per cent (most of whom are humanitarian entrants) come from the Middle East and North Africa.

 On the other hand, we should not be surprised that humanitarian entrants found it harder to find employment and, as a result, had lower incomes and poorer housing than other migrants:

 We don't pick these migrants for their education and English skills. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 We choose them precisely because they are the most in need of help. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 And we give them that help.

 Professor Richardson's report confirms that the help is well targeted and appreciated. And despite these outward signs of hardship, humanitarian entrants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy to be in Australia. This confirms my opinion that not only is the humanitarian program performing an outstanding job of targeting those we can help the most. It also brings people to Australia who have the attitude that will enable them ultimately to prosper in their new homeland.

 Sue Richardson's report presents a very positive picture of the early experiences of new migrants in Australia and provides some key insights into their motivations for coming here.

 Together with the findings of its companion report into labour force experiences, it helps explain why Australia continues to perform well in attracting high quality migrants in the face of increasing international competition. Compared, for example, with the performance of countries such as New Zealand and Canada.

 In this context, it is gratifying to learn that around 75 per cent of the migrants surveyed said they would encourage others to migrate to Australia.

 And I believe that these favourable outcomes will continue to improve the longer the migrants are in Australia.

 As I have mentioned, the survey on which this report is based is longitudinal. The same people who were interviewed six months after arrival were also interviewed a year later - that is eighteen months after they arrived in Australia.

 My department will soon commission two further studies of the labour force and settlement experiences of migrants based on the second round of interviews. Early indications are that the outcomes are substantially improved even over those reported at six months. In other words, the honeymoon period of six months appears to be developing into an amicable marriage between the migrants and their new land.

 In closing, I would like to make one more observation.

 Migration is perhaps the single most important event in the history and sociology of Australia. One in every four of us came from another country, and for these Australians migration will always be one of the most important events of their lives. For many more - the families and descendants of migrants - migration remains a central part of their identity and their family memories.

 In other words, Sue Richardson's report tells us about one of the seminal Australian experiences. I look forward to finding out more about this archetypal Australian story.

 I would now like to invite Professor Richardson to provide us with some observations about her report.

 Professor Richardson is the Director of the National institute of Labour Studies and Professor of Labour Economics at Flinders University, Adelaide.

 She has had an impressive career in the fields of economics and labour studies both in Australia and overseas, having been a visiting scholar or fellow at such institutions as the ANU, Colombia University, and Cambridge University. The list of her publications is equally prodigious.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I take pleasure in introducing Professor Sue Richardson.
