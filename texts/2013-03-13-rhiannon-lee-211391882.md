 media release

  Wednesday 13 March 2013   Greens push for more and better overseas aid  Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne and Greens spokesperson on overseas aid Senator Lee Rhiannon will join the Oaktree Foundation rally tomorrow morning.   Christine Milne will speak at the launch of ‘The Movement to End Poverty’, an initiative of the Oaktree Foundation with up to 1000 young people visiting parliament to lobby for more and better overseas aid.  WHO: Christine Milne and Lee Rhiannon  WHERE: Parliament House front lawns   WHEN: The rally will begin at 8am; Christine Milne will speak at 8.15am  The Senate will vote on a Greens motion to protect the overseas aid budget from cuts in the upcoming budget (motion below) at 11.50 - 12.30 tomorrow.   Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne said “It will be inspiring to have hundreds of young people descend on parliament to meet MPs and push for Australia to give its fair share in overseas aid to end global poverty.   “I congratulate the Oaktree Foundation for bringing the call for more and better aid to the doors of parliament.  “The aid budget should not be treated as a honey pot for the old parties to dip into when they are looking for more money.”  Greens spokesperson on overseas aid Senator Lee Rhiannon said “In the past year, the Labor Government has pushed back its commitment to increase aid and directed $375 million away from in-country aid programs to pay for the onshore costs of detaining refugees.   “My motion calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that our aid budget is ring-fenced from further cuts in the upcoming budget.   “The Greens are asking Labor and the Coalition to reaffirm their commitment to increase Australia’s aid contribution to the UN’s endorsed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income and to publicly release their timetables for reaching this target.”  Media Contacts Christine Milne: Alexandra Lamb on 0437587562 Lee Rhiannon: Alison Orme on 0487350880

 media release

  Notice of Motion - Senator RHIANNON (New South Wales)   I give notice that on 14 March 2013 I will move:  That the Senate— 1) Notes that:  a) The United Nations‘ endorsed target to meet the Millennium Development Goals is for developed nations to devote 0.7 percent of GNI to foreign aid by 2015 yet Australia currently contributes a mere 0.35 percent. b) Both Labor and the Coalition went to the 2010 election with a commitment to increase aid to 0.5 percent of GNI by 2015. c) In the 2012/2013 budget, Labor pushed back by a year its commitment to increase aid to 0.5 percent and the Coalition removed its timetable altogether. d) Since the 2012/2013 budget the government has directed $375m from the aid budget to pay for the onshore costs of detaining refugees, and the ADF wrongly classified almost $190m in military spending as overseas development aid.   2) Calls on:   a) the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that the overseas aid budget does not suffer further cuts in the May 2013/2014 budget; b)            the Government and Coalition to publicly reaffirm their commitment to the UN’s       endorsed target of 0.7%  and to release their timetable for reaching the target.
