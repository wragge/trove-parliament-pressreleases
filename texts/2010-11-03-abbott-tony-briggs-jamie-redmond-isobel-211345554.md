 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 

 THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR 

 FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH 

 Tony Abbott Doorstop - Visit to Inverbrackie;  interest rates   03/11/10  

 

 TONY ABBOTT: It’s good to be here with my federal colleagues Scott Morrison, the  Shadow Minister for Immigration, and also with Jamie Briggs, the local member, but also  with Isobel Redmond, the Leader of the Opposition here in South Australia. I think Jamie has  done a terrific job articulating the concerns of local people about the proposed detention  centre here at Inverbrackie.    

 Now, I’m going to ask each of my colleagues to speak in turn, but I just want to say that this  is obviously quite an idyllic part of Australia and bringing asylum seekers to a place like this  is hardly sending the right message to the tens of thousands of potential boat people in our  region. I think bringing asylum seekers to an area like this is basically saying to the people  smugglers and their customers that the welcome mat is out, that the red carpet treatment is  available and it’s the last thing that the Government should be doing.    

 Now, the basic problem here is that the Government has lost control of our borders and it  can’t stop the boats and building a detention centre here is not going to contribute to stopping  the boats, if anything it is going to add to the pull factors which have been in place ever since  the Rudd-Gillard Government changed the rules back in August of 2008.    

 So, I’m here today to listen to local people but just as I look at this facility here, it’s hard to  see that bringing asylum seeker families to a beautiful idyllic area like this is going to send  anything other than the dead wrong message to the people smugglers and their potential  customers. So Scott, do you want to say a few words?    

 SCOTT MORRISON: Thank you. Well, it’s good to have the opportunity to come here today  and to be joined by Tony Abbott and Isobel Redmond and of course Jamie Briggs. What  we’re doing here today is providing the consultation directly to the community of Woodside  that the Minister has so far still refused to do. We had the sanitised and forced form of  discussions that occurred earlier this week but still the Minister would not come to Woodside.  

 

 Now, I understand he toured through this facility but never had the gumption to go and face  the people of Woodside in an open meeting. That’s what we’ll be doing today. We’ll be  listening very carefully to the concerns and questions, legitimate questions which the  Government has described as hysteria. I think that’s a very insulting way to treat legitimate  concerns which range from everything from bushfire risks to simply how this is going to  impact on how the local schools are run. It’s not just a question of how much money Chris  Bowen is going to shell out to state governments to keep them quiet about this, it’s a question  about how it’s going to work on the ground and the reason this is occurring, as Tony has said,  is because this Government has a rolling detention crisis. The reason there is a need for 400  more beds here at Inverbrackie or another 1,500 at Northam or another 600-odd up in Curtin,  the reason for all of that is because the boats keep coming. We have had a record number of  boats already arrive this year and decisions such as this will ensure that there are more.    

 JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, thanks Tony, Scott and Isobel and for you all being here on this  beautiful warm Adelaide Hills day. Look, it is a great pleasure to have Tony and Scott here. I  think this is a great contrast from the Labor Party’s style of managing our country. You’ve  got Tony Abbott the Leader of the Opposition, our Shadow Immigration Minister Scott  Morrison going to a forum which is for the community, for the community to have their say 

 about what they think of this decision, something that Julia Gillard, who was here 24 hours  before her announcement of this detention facility wasn’t willing to do, something that Chris  Bowen who strolled into town, went 20km away from the actually site on Monday and had a  hand-picked meeting wasn’t willing to do.    

 There are concerns, there are concerns about bush fire risk a month before the bushfire season  starts. Chris Bowen said on Monday he’s got no plan to deal with a catastrophic day. There  are still concerns about the impact on the schools, the impact on health services; there are  legitimate questions which people in the community have which not been answered and so  Tony, Scott and I will listen to their concerns today and we’ll take them back to parliament.    

 ISOBEL REDMOND: Thank you. Well, can I first of all welcome Scott and Tony to the  beautiful Adelaide Hills as warm as it is, and thank them for taking the time to come to visit  this area. As they’ve already indicated, this is a wonderful part of the world and my concern  is simply that at a state level the government has not taken the steps that it should have taken  to ensure that the community’s concerns are addressed, that there are, as the others have  already mentioned, a number of issues, particularly in relation to schooling and how our local  small schools will cope with a sudden influx of a number of children who obviously will not  have English as a first language, that will certainly have an impact - we need to address those  issues.    

 The risk of bushfire in this area, particularly after a wet winter is another major issue, for this  area for the settlement of people who are not even familiar with the risks of bushfire. We  have enough trouble here with people who’ve moved into the area who are permanent  residents who don’t understand the risks. This is a major concern and we do need to address 

 it.  

 

 I think the presence of Tony and Scott here today indicates that on the Liberal side of politics  we have a good relationship, we expect to be able to discuss these things with the community  and with each other at state and federal level and the failure of our state leaders in this state to  discuss with our federal Government I think is an indictment on them.    

 TONY ABBOTT: Thanks Isobel. Ok, alright, are there any questions that people have?    

 QUESTION: Tony, isn’t it true that the Opposition is powerless to actually stop this  detention facility going ahead?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Well, I don’t believe that the people of Australia are powerless. I think that  people power does sometimes get a response in Canberra and I think it is so obvious that this  is the wrong place to be building a detention centre that if people make their voices heard,  maybe even a Government as tone deaf, even a Prime Minister with as tin an ear as this one  will listen.    

 QUESTION: [inaudible] more compassionate version though then previous Coalition  government centres such as Baxter and Woomera?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Well, the point I should make is that the Howard Government did get  families out of detention. There were virtually no children in detention by the time the  Howard Government left office because, amongst other things, we actually stopped the boats.    

 Now, if you want to avoid detaining women and children the best way to do it is to stop the  boats. But the point I make about this is that there are many, many Australian families who  would be perfectly happy to live in this kind of accommodation and what sort of a signal are  we sending to the people smugglers to bring asylum seekers to a place like this and  effectively settle them in the community. Basically it’s saying to the people smugglers, it’s  saying to their customers, if you can get here you can stay here and you can have a great life.  Now, that’s hardly the message we want to send to people who are contemplating coming to  Australia illegally.    

 QUESTION: But these houses are empty at the moment and there aren’t other needy  Australian families living in them, so why not make them available for refugees?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Well, I suspect if the Federal Government were to announce that these  houses were available, put proposals to us, they would be knocked over in the rush. But  what’s happened here is that the Government has said no, this former military  accommodation is going to be used to house asylum seeker families. Now, they’ve done that  without consultation in a very arrogant and even cowardly way, announcing a decision and  not fronting local people to explain it and defend it. But, as I said, I’m sure that if the Federal  Government was to say the accommodation here at the Woodside base is available, what do 

 you think we should do with it? There’d be any number of proposals.    

 QUESTION: Do you feel your visit today and meeting with local people may fuel racism that  may not have been here in the past?    

 TONY ABBOTT: I completely reject any suggestion that people don’t have a right to ask  legitimate questions about what happens to their community if there is a big influx of people.  This idea that the people of this area are somehow rednecks to question what is an arrogant  and cowardly Government decision is just wrong.    

 QUESTION: Two more boats arrived last night, do you directly link their arrival with these  announcements about the new detention centres?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Well, it’s very interesting that there have been 28 boats and more than  1,400 people come since the election. So, scarcely two months after the election, scarcely two  months after an outcome we’ve had this further surge in boats and arrivals. Now, I think that  there is no doubt that a Government which has lost control of its borders is a standing  incitement to the people smugglers to keep sending the boats and that’s why what we need to  do is reduce the pull factors, introduce temporary protection visas, make sure that we have  rigorous offshore processing, don’t send what would effectively be a picture postcard to the  people smugglers ‘come to Inverbrackie’.    

 QUESTION: Do you think it would have been more appropriate then for the Government to  consider reopening Baxter than Invernbrackie?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Look, I’m here today to listen to the people of Invernbrackie. I know what  the Government should do. I think the Australian people know what the Government should  do; it should stop the boats and having a detention centre here in the idyllic Adelaide Hills is 

 hardly the way to stop the boats.    

 SCOTT MORRISON: Can I just add something to that last question, last week with the  support of Tony and Jamie we moved a motion in the parliament and we moved the motion in  the parliament that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration should undertake the  consultation that the Government refused to undertake.    

 Now, the Government rejected that motion out of hand and used their numbers with the  support of a few others. One of the things that was in the terms of reference of that inquiry  was to look at what were all the other alternatives that were available to the Government  instead of using this site. Now, that remains a very valid question. The department has been  running around now for months looking at any number of sites all around the country, yet this  site was chosen and I think it’s a very fair question that the locals have is why this site, why  not other sites?    

 QUESTION: Where would you put them?  

 

 SCOTT MORRISON: Well, our policy before the last election was to reopen the tax payer  funded facility in Nauru and that would have included family appropriate accommodation.  I’ve been to Nauru, I know it can be done. That was our choice, that was our process. This  Government’s choice - they said before the election they wouldn’t be expanding the onshore 

 detention network, since then they’ve opened another 3,000 beds. So we’ve always been  upfront with the Australian people about what our policies are, this Government changes  them by the day.    

 QUESTION: Well Mr Abbott would you support a detention centre in the outback; is that a  better option?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Look, the point I’m trying to make is that you do not send idyllic picture  postcards from Australia to the people smugglers and their customers and you know this is  effectively a postcard from Australia saying come on over, that’s what it is and I just think  that that’s the last thing that we should be doing.    

 QUESTION: [inaudible] rate rise, obviously the big banks are under some pressure over their  decision to raise interest rates above the RBA level, you’ve spoken about your mortgage, who  do you bank with and would you consider shifting your loan?    

 TONY ABBOTT: Look, it’s not my mortgage which is the issue, what’s the issue here is lack  of competition in the sector and the Coalition has put forward a plan to get more competition  in the sector. Last week the Government pilloried the plan, this week a very embarrassed  Government is starting to look at it. Well, they should not have got us into this position in the  first place but I think that Joe Hockey and the Coalition can feel vindicated by the  Government’s shuffling belatedly and embarrassedly towards our position today.    

 Thanks very much.
