 CHIPP TO HAWKE : DOUBLE YOUTH REFUGES

 "How many more kids will have to die on our streets before the 

 Government takes action?" Senator Chipp said today referring to 

 the report that a homeless teenager was burnt to death in a bin 

 in one of Melbourne's city lanes.

 "In last year's Budget the amount for youth refuges under the 

 Youth Services Program was set at the miserable figure of $3.8m 

 on a national basis. This represented to increase in real terms 

 compared with the last Fraser Budget.

 "There is no youth refuge in the inner city of Melbourne and many 

 regions across Australia where there is at best one youth refuge 

 for several municapilities or none at all.

 "Existing funding guidelines do not provide for the establishment 

 of new refuges.

 I

 "I know that a committee has been meeting for months now 

 reviewing these guidelines.  I don't want to hear that they are 

 still 1  under consideration* .  I want the Government to take 

 immediate action to double the amount available for youth refuges 

 and to provide it to the community groups waiting to start youth 

 refuges.

 "I repeat: 1  How many more kids have to die before the Government 

 gets its act together?'"
