 Labor still has the Australian Federal Police intercepting boat arrivals 

 17/04/13 

 The Australian Federal Police have yet again had to assist in the interception of an illegal boat arrival  despite not having any maritime capacity, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  and Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said. 

 “Despite the AFP now having to assist the overstretched Border Protection Command in intercepting  boat arrivals on a regular basis, Labor has cut both funding and personnel from the agency in the last  two consecutive Budgets, including $133 million in the 2012/13 Budget,” Mr Keenan said. 

 “In the last two weeks alone, Labor’s border protection failures have resulted in boats arriving on  the mainland undetected as well as the AFP, the WA State Police Force and two Australian citizens in  a dingy having to intercept illegal boat arrivals. 

 “It is no wonder that Border Protection Command cannot keep up with this workload when you have  24 boats and well over 1500 people arrive in just over two weeks. 

 “The Government must restore the funding cuts that it has made to our frontline border protection  agencies in their May Budget so that they have the resources and personnel to deal with this crisis at  our borders. 

 “As we approach the 300th boat arrival for this financial year, the Gillard Government must put an  end to this daily ferry service being run by the people smugglers. 

 “Labor has made Australia a soft touch on border protection and until there is a change in policy and  a change in Government the people smugglers will continue to exploit this,” Mr Keenan said.
