 TRANSCRIPT 

 TONY BURKE MP  Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP  INTERVIEW , PARLIAMENT HOUSE,  CANBERRA  WEDNESDAY 6 SEPTEMBER  2006   

 E&OE-PROOF ONLY  ________________________________________________________________________ 

 Subject:  Visa 457; Jack Zhang,    ________________________________________________________________________ 

 

 Tony Burke:  Good morning.  The stories of people being abused under 457 visas are  getting worse every day.  What we’ve had today is the story of Mr Jack Zhang, which is  reported in the Fairfax media.  Jack, in order to get a job had to pay to receive a wage:   just under $10 000 to an employment agency in China and a further $10 000 to his own  employer.  Every week $200 came out of his pay packet to repay that debt.  Once the debt  was fully paid he was fired.  Once the media found out about it, he was then evicted from  his home, because his employer was also his landlord. 

 

 I wish I could say that this visa system is out of control.  But it’s worse than that.  What  we’re seeing with these visas is them being used in exactly the way the government  hopes they’ll be used: that’s to drive wages down, to take away your rights at work.   

 You need to have a system of temporary work visas but you don’t need to have a system  that is open to exploitation the way the government’s allowing this to go forward.   

 I’d also refer to Gary Hardgrave’s comments that the new answer to skilled migration,  instead of training Australians, is to open up a training college in Kenya in the refugee  camp.  So people who’ve been turned away from TAFE in Kalgoorlie or in Kingston, the  Australian government will be training more apprentices they’ll just be training them in  Kenya. 

 

 It’s one of the more bizarre approaches I’ve ever heard of to training Australians and that  seems to be the government throwing its hands up in the air and realising it can’t train  Australians first when that’s actually its job.   

 Journalist: Is your concern with Mr Jack Zhang or with the Australian workers he  displaces?   

 Tony Burke: Well it works both ways.  The skilled migration program -the alleged  skilled migration program, he ended up sweeping the floor - but I am concerned that he  takes away Australian jobs, the positions aren’t being advertised first.  But secondly, once 

 he comes and gets exploited, every other Australian in the marketplace has to compete  for those rates.  That sets the new low benchmark.  It’s bad that he gets exploited.  That  then drives wages and conditions down for everybody in the workforce. 

 

 Journalist:  But when you see the union movement and others taking up his cause, they’re  really crying crocodile tears aren’t they?   

 Tony Burke: No.  Anything that’s bad for him is bad the whole of the Australian  workforce.  If you set a new low benchmark, that affects everybody.  And it does exactly  what the government wanted when it introduced its extreme IR laws. 

 

 Journalist: What do you think should be done?  What sanctions should be put in place?   

 Tony Burke: You shouldn’t be allowed to use temporary work visas as a way of paying  people below what the market rate in Australia is.  You shouldn’t be allowed to have  temporary work visas be used to displace Australians in work.   

 Journalist:  Do you think this 457 visa should just be abolished?   

 Tony Burke: No.  You need to have a system of temporary work visas.  What you need  them to do is be genuinely involved in filling skills shortages.  These visas can be used  for positions that have never been advertised in Australia.  The first ad to appear 

 anywhere in the world can be in China.   

 Journalist: Tony what’s your reaction to another four of the Bali Nine being sentenced to  death.   

 Tony Burke: It’s chilling.  The people there were involved in a very serious crime.  But  even the prosecution in Indonesia was asking for life and they were given death.   

 Journalist: What should the Howard Government do?   

 Tony Burke: I have no interest in politicising this.  Labor will work with the Government  in whatever way to try to get a lowering of the sentence.  They were charged with a  serious offence there’s going to be some penalty.  We just all hope and pray that it’s not 

 the death penalty.    

 END.
