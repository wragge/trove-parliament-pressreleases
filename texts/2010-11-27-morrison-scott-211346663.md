 More boats add to Labor's rolling detention crisis  

 27/11/10  

 The arrival of two boats 24 hours will add further pressure to Labor's rolling detention  crisis, Shadow Minister for Productivity and Population & Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 “The first boat turned up 24 hours before a media release was issued, showing the  Government withheld the information, consistent with their broader policy of secrecy  as seen with the NBN.  The second vessel arrived yesterday afternoon,” Mr Morrison 

 said. 

 “The latest two arrivals had 74 people on board and are now on their way to an  already overcrowded Christmas Island,” he said. 

 “Three years and one hundred and ninety two boats later, since Labor was first  elected, Australia has record numbers and a rolling crisis in our detention network. 

 “Riots, brawling, gruesome protests and self harm have all returned to our detention  network, after three years of Labor's failed policies. 

 “Three years ago you could count the number of people being detained who had  arrived illegally by boat on less than one hand, there were just four. That was the  legacy of the Coalition's policies that stopped the boats. 

 “After Labor's failed policies there are more than 5,100 illegal boat arrivals being  detained with more on their way to Christmas Island. 

 “Labor has committed more than $350 million to establish an additional 6,000 beds in  our detention system, not including the hundreds of millions more needed to run the  expanded network. 

 “This is a government that has created more beds in our immigration detention  network than in our public hospitals.  

 “The arrival of another two boats serves as a further reminder of Labor's continued  failure,” Mr Morrison said.
