 NEWS RELEASE

 Date: 13 April 1990

 AUSTRALIA PROVIDES $1.5m FOR BOAT PEOPLE IN INDONESIA

 Australia will provide $1.5 million for urgently needed  

 upgrading of the Galang holding centre for Indo-Chinese  

 boat people in Indonesia,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs  

 and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans announced today.

 Senator Evans said the recent dramatic increase in  

 arrivals of Indo-Chinese boat people had placed a severe  

 strain on the Galang centre, which is the largest in.  

 Indonesia. .  .

 "Australia's contribution, to be channelled through the  

 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), is  

 a further demonstration of Australia's determination to  

 cooperate, particularly with the countries in the region  

 bearing the heavy burden of the boat people, to find a 

 solution to this tragic dilemma," he said.

 "At the Galang centre,  thousands of boat people are being  

 housed in public buildings which are unsuitable for  

 accommodation, and the level of sanitation has  

 deteriorated rapidly.

 "As an immediate measure,  UNHCR will construct 40 basic  

 huts to accommodate 2000 people, and refurbish nearby  

 sanitary facilities.

 "In the longer term the camp facilities will be upgraded  

 to accommodate around 17,000 instead of the current  

 10,000. The Australian contribution will be used for this  

 longer term upgrading."
