 Minister Attends Act Schools Debating Championships

 MPS 66/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Philip Ruddock will attend the ACT School Debating  Championship at Radford College this evening.

 Radford College and Lyneham High School will take on the topic 'That Australia's policy on boat people has been a success'  in the Grand Final Debate.

 Mr Ruddock, who recently met the newly-crowned world champion Australian Schools Debating Team at a reception at  Parliament House, said he was expecting a hard-fought debate.

 'I am looking forward to seeing the teams' hard work and practice come to fruition,' Mr Ruddock said.

 'As good citizens, we should be open to the views of others, and willing to be active participants in a robust - but civilised -  debate about issues affecting our country.

 'The skills learned by students involved in debating will enable them to be active participants in a vigorous, open-minded and  ongoing dialogue about where we are going as a nation,' Mr Ruddock said.

 The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs sponsored the ACT Schools Debating  Championship.

 'I commend all participants in the ACT Schools Debating Championship, and look forward to an ongoing relationship with  schools debating in Australia,' Mr Ruddock said.
