 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION SCOTT MORRISON  

 Wednesday 10th July 2013 

 Subjects: Labor’s $1 billion detention cost blow out on illegal boat arrivals, 100,000  projected illegal boat arrivals over three more years of Kevin Rudd based on current  arrival rates 

 E&OE 

 MORRISON: 

 The blow out in detention costs revealed today for Serco to run our detention  network across Australia and at Christmas Island is further evidence that Australians  are paying the price for Kevin Rudd’s decision to get rid of the policies that worked  under John Howard when he rolled out the Rudd carpet to people smugglers almost  six years ago. When Kevin Rudd was first elected there were just four people in our  immigration detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. At the last election  that number had grown to more than 4,000. As we speak today that number has  grown to more than 9,500 people. The total cost blow out that has resulted from all of  this and all the costs whether it is in the community or the detention network or other  places for the immigration department is now more than $10.3 billion over the  forward estimates since 2009/10. That is the price that Australians are paying for  Kevin Rudd’s decision to get rid of John Howard’s policies that worked. The  particular significance of these figures today is they are for our immigration detention  network. Back in 2011 when Chris Bowen introduced the community release scheme  the promise then from his Department Secretary, then Mr Metcalfe, from him as  Minister and the Minister that followed in Brendan O’Connor was that this would  make it all cheaper. They were going to put all people out into the community, where  it would be cheaper. But the truth is very different to that. We have more people in  detention today, our detention network is more crowded today, than the day Minister  Bowen outlined that promise all those years ago. The costs are higher, there are  more people in there and the cost to the taxpayer is even greater. That is the  significance in the blow out to this detention contract today of $1 billion. 

 Mr Rudd must be judged on his record when it comes to these issues and let’s  reflect on that record again. When he came to office people were arriving illegally by  boat at the rate of two per month. At the last election they were arriving at the rate of  22 per day. Today they are arriving at the rate of more than 100 people every single  day and we have three boats turning up every two days. So what can we expect  from this Prime Minister if he is re-elected? Well just simply working off the actual  numbers of the rate at which people are arriving now under the last 100 days that 

 would mean if that was projected out over the next term of a Labor Government we  would move to a figure, as I have noted here on these charts, of over 100,000  people during the next term of a Labor Government under Kevin Rudd. That is more  people than is needed to fill the MCG. Now if people think that that is an alarming  projection, if we had actually estimated the number of people that would have ended  up coming here in this term and we had used that same assumption at the last  election then only about 25,000 people would have turned up during this  Parliamentary term and so far we have had more than 39,000. So if Kevin Rudd is  re-elected then this is the sort of scenario that people can expect. People can expect  that under Kevin Rudd the boats will continue to come because the only thing Kevin  Rudd is planning to do is keep talking. 

 The time has come Mr Rudd for the election solution when it comes to deciding the  policies that should be on our borders. The Australian people should be given the  choice about what they want to see back on our borders and the policies that they  believe should be in place on our borders. The people of Australia I think have a very  clear choice when it comes to this election - they can have a government led by  Kevin Rudd’s whose policy is to go to a conference for more talk. Just more talk from  Kevin Rudd. Or they can choose the Coalition who will not only restore the policies  that worked under John Howard but go the extra mile as we have been making very  clear to the Australian people now for years. At this election we will pass the point of  no return when it comes to stopping the boats. With the alarming rate of arrivals that  are occurring now if that were allowed to continue for a further three years by the re-election of the Rudd Government then this problem will be not just out of control it  will be potentially beyond control. So this election there is the choice to stop the  boats or to let the boats keep coming. The people smugglers at this election if Kevin  Rudd is re-elected will have not only won the battle, they will have won the war. 

 QUESTION: 

 What will this third column look like under a Coalition Government? 

 MORRISON: 

 You can expect within the term of the next Coalition government if we are elected  that we will see a return over time in that term to the levels we were able to achieve  under the Howard Government. 

 QUESTION: 

 So just remind us, how many boats? How many arrivals? 

 MORRISON: 

 Well as I said to you yesterday, in our first term if we are elected we will get  ourselves back to the situation where the boats have stopped. 

 QUESTION: 

 What do you mean by passing the point of no return? 

 MORRISON: 

 What I mean by that is we are currently at the rate of three boats turning up every  two days. We are at the rate of more than 100 people a day and that is up from 22  people a day at the last election. This means the people smugglers’ business model  would be so hyperdrived if Kevin Rudd is re-elected that the potential to have the  sort of effect that we believe we can have right now after three more years of Kevin  Rudd can push this beyond the point of no return. But there is the time to act now for  the Australian people. That is why I am saying Mr Rudd it is time for the election  solution. He should call the election and he should let the Australian people decide  the border policies they want to see put in place. Either more talk from him or action  from Tony Abbott on day one. 

 QUESTION: 

 On the cost blow out and the increased arrivals, do you know if that is unique to  Australia over the past few years or are other countries facing similar situations? 

 MORRISON: 

 Well talk to Serco. Australia is their biggest business. It is their biggest business. And  this is the business they are in globally. Australia has been the growth industry for  detention facilities . It has been a detention centre revolution under this Labor  Government. It has been a stimulus package all of its own to go along with the other  measures that Kevin Rudd put in place when he went on his spending spree. The  Australian situation in terms of cost blow outs in this area is phenomenal and they  are the product of one thing - not Mr Rudd’s slowness to act but the decision he took  to act when he first became Prime Minister and that is when he abolished John  Howard’s border protection wall. 

 QUESTION: 

 So how is the Coalition going to reduce detention costs? 

 MORRISON: 

 By stopping the boats. That’s how you do it. That’s the only way you can do it. This  government pretended that just by letting people out into the community and they did  that initially with work rights and we told them at the time - if you do this you are  sending out an invitation for people to come - and that is exactly what has occurred.  They changed the decision later on to remove the work rights but this is a  government that doesn’t get it. They don’t listen and they don’t believe in strong  border protection policies. That is the clear choice people have at this election. I  accept that there are many Australians who may not agree with the Coalition’s  policy. There may be many in the media who don’t agree with the Coalition’s  policies. The Australian people should decide who comes to this country and the  circumstances in which they come by having the border policies in place that they  believe in. That’s why we need an election solution when it comes to our borders. 

 QUESTION: 

 So community detention is cheaper but you are saying it leads to more arrivals? 

 MORRISON: 

 Well that is the history, that is the experience. The inability of this government to put  in place the policies that stopped the boats coming has led to the continued arrival of  people and even if they are, as they are, spending less time in detention they just  can’t push them through the detention network fast enough. It just keeps clogging  up. We have more people now on Christmas Island as we speak than where there  when the riots took place. This is a government under whom it only ever gets worse,  the costs only ever get greater and the only other thing you can be certain of is Kevin  Rudd will only keep talking. That is all Kevin does. He goes to conferences and he  talks. 

 QUESTION: 

 What do you think of Paris Aristotle’s suggestion that asylum seekers should be  given work rights? 

 MORRISON: 

 We don’t agree with that proposal because we believe that if you throw away your  documents then you shouldn’t just be at the back of the queue, you shouldn’t be in  the queue at all. That is our policy. It has been our policy for more than three years.  We will never give people an incentive to get on a boat to come illegally to Australia.  We just won’t do it. It is not in our DNA and they are the policies we need because  people will continue dying at sea, people will continue to still have the visas that they  may otherwise have got waiting in those camps around the world denied to them.  The cost will continue to blow out and the boats will continue to come. We have been  around this now for a long time. It is time to have it decided and the place for that to  be decided is at an election. So Mr Rudd, call the election, let’s have the election  solution to your border crisis. Thank you. 

 END
