 TAMPA 12 MONTHS ON - DEFENCE PATROLS COSTING $685 MILLION

 Twelve months on from the Tampa incident the Government is maintaining Defence patrols that will cost $685 million in 2002-03.

 Defence and the taxpayer are now paying for the Howard Government’s decision to ramp up patrols against unauthorised boat arrivals just prior to the 2001 election.

 $685 million represents the full cost of operating the ships and aircraft involved in Operation Relex, including salaries, fuel, repairs, rations and capital depreciation. The figures are calculated on the basis of information from Defence on the individual ships and aircraft involved in the operation.

 The same methodology was used by the Audit Office when costing Defence’s contribution to Coastwatch patrols.  In its report the Audit Office highlighted that Defence aircraft were ten times more expensive to operate than civilian contractors.

 In an attempt to hide the cost of this operation the Minister for Defence, Robert Hill, has personally directed that no information on costings be released.

 Because the Howard Government has not fully funded the cost of Operation Relex Defence has been forced to make cuts and savings across a range of areas.  Major equipment acquisitions have been delayed, essential maintenance and upgrades have been postponed and exercises have been cancelled, all impacting on the future capability of the ADF.

 The Navy has admitted that the warfighting skills of its personnel are eroding because of the time spent on border patrols.

 The $685 million spent on Operation Relex confirms that the use of highly trained Defence Force personnel and sophisticated warships is a very expensive way of deterring unarmed boats.  The full cost of operating a frigate is approximately $1 million a day.

 Labor is committed to the introduction of a Coastguard as a more cost-effective way patrolling our northern borders.  This is consistent with the use of civilian ships and aircraft in patrolling against boats attempting to import drugs and firearms and illegally access Australia’s fishing grounds.
