 OPPOSITION TO CUT MIGRANT FUNDING - WHERE WILL THE ÎÎÎ¤.Î¤,?

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affaire, Senator Robert Ray, has called on the opposition to  give details of the 520 million in cuts it says it would  make to the immigration portfolio if it were in Government.

 Senator Ray said the Opposition's plan for the economy,  released in October last year, gave no details of which  programs would be cut back or ended, to enable its $20  million funding cut to immigration to go ahead.

 "The Hawke Government's budget for the immigration portfolio  is well documented," the Minister said.

 "Given that the Opposition has announced a major cut in  spending on immigration, the Opposition immigration  spokesman, Mr Ruddock, should come clean and make public  the details of hie program of cuts.

 "At the moment, we can only guess where t h e  "They would find it very difficult to justify a cut to the  department's immigration processing and visa issuing  operations because computerisation in those areas has  resulted in a massive increase in productivity in recent  years.

"Mr Ruddock must tell us, for instance, whether the Adult  Migrant Education Program, which had 70,500 migrants  learning English last year, is on his hit list," Senator Ray  said. â  "Would he cut the community grant-in-aid scheme, which gives  .  maximum'priority to the settlement needs of women and young immigrants, refugees and torture victims? .

"If he fails to detail where the Opposition would make its  cuts to immigration, he will confirm people's worst fears  about Coalition plans for the immigration portfolio," Senator Ray said.
