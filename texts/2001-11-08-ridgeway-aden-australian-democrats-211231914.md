 A Statement From Senator Aden Ridgeway The Race-Based Election

 After six years of this Coalition Government we now find ourselves in a similar intellectual climate to that which the members of this Government claimed existed before they won office in 1996.

 That  is  -  one  in  which  there  is  no  room  for  debate,  no  room  for  expression  of  ideas  and  no  room  for difference on any topic that doesn’t accord with the “politically correct” government line.

 The political climate is charged with the destructive forces of racism and intolerance.

 But maybe those now expressing shock at the race card turning up on the electoral table, should look a little more closely at the deck from which it’s being played.

 I was elected to the Senate in 1998 after 18 months of a Native Title-inspired race based hysteria campaign whipped up by the Howard Government.

 Now I see those same divisive sentiments being fanned in this so-called debate about refugees.

 I echo the concerns being expressed by many public figures including the “old-guard” of the Liberal party and commend their courage in calling for leadership on this issue.

 Never have we needed it more.

 As an Australian Democrat Senator, I have witnessed manipulation and abuse of the legislative process that resulted  in  immigration  legislation  being  passed  which  breached  Australia’s  international  commitments  to basic human rights.

 I have witnessed a government that has been able to inflame antagonism towards all refugees by distorting the facts and painting them as potential terrorists and drug dealers.

 I have witnessed the talk back radio test being the only the determinant of public policy, with both parties allowing themselves to be totally intimidated by perceived popular opinion.

 This “lowest common denominator policy” has been the hallmark of this Government’s performance and we cannot expect anything better from either of the two old parties.

 I believe there are many Australians who want to see their political representatives take up the fight against racism in this country - whether it’s racism against Indigenous Australians, migrants or refugees.
