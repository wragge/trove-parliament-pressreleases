  STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE FEDERAL OPPOSITION, THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY 
MP

  

  Telstra and Ericsson send Mobile Phones to 
Refugee Camps

  

  Following representations by Senator Chris Schacht, who last week 
visited refugee camps in th e Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia, 
I have been informed that Telstra and Ericsson have responded by donating 
mobile phones for use in the refugee camps.

  

 Recent media reports have shown the effectiveness 
of mobile phones in allowing refugees to trace the movements of family 
members and to keep in touch with loved ones.

  

 Ericsson has kindly provided six mobile phones, and 
Telstra will cover call costs up to $10,000.

  

 I thank both Telstra and Ericsson for their generosity 
and compassion with this kind gesture to displaced and suffering people 
half a world away.

  

 CARE Australia will arrange the use and distribution 
of the phones in the refugee camps.
