 Ruddock Introduces Tough New Measures to Reduce Illegal Entrants MPS 046/2000 - Budget Media Release 1

 The Federal Government has moved to further combat the number of people arriving in Australia illegally while at the same time increasing the number of places available to people who want to migrate to Australia legally.

 The Government has allocated an additional $116.8 million to introduce additional measures to tackle people smuggling and for a long-term strategy to establish new detention centres, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

 These costs will be offset to a significant extent by savings resulting from increased efficiencies in transport, resourcing and administration of detainees.

 A $64.7million package over four years across the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Attorney General's and Family and Community Services portfolios will build on initiatives already implemented by the Government to tackle the problem of people smugglers and illegal arrivals.

 "The new measures will send a clear signal that Australia is serious about protecting its borders and we will not tolerate what in many cases is flagrant disregard for Australia's laws," the Minister said.

 "In addition, the Government has allocated $52.1m to establish new detention centres and refurbish existing centres over the next few years.

 "The Australian Government continues to warmly welcome people who 'follow the rules' to live permanently in Australia - that is, the migrants who meet strict criteria to migrate

 through the Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program or people in genuine need of resettlement through our Humanitarian Program.

 "An illustration of this warm welcome is the planned increase in the number of places for skilled and family migrants in 2000-01 - up 6,000 places to 76,000 - and our commitment to the Humanitarian Program which will be maintained at 12,000 in 2000-01.

 "Nevertheless, we shall continue our efforts to stem the tide of unauthorised arrivals," he said.

 Measures to Stop Illegal Arrivals

 Mr Ruddock said the new measures included:

 $12.4 million over four years to expand DIMA's network of compliance officers to help Australia's posts, initially in Islamabad, Belgrade, Moscow, Amman, Tehran, Suva and Cairo, combat document and identity fraud and people smuggling. The new staff will complement similar positions in Asia and the Middle East;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $3.1 million over four years to place additional airline liaison officers in airports known to be key transit routes for unauthorised arrivals; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $5.3 million over four years for additional off-shore resources to speed up humanitarian processing to combat the false perception that unauthorised arrival is the only way to engage Australia's protection obligations;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $5 million each year in the form of targeted aid contributions and resettlement support as part of Australia's efforts to build a coordinated international approach to develop a long-term solution for Afghan and Iraqi refugees;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $2 million in 2000-01 to develop a pilot program for the use of targeted reintegration assistance for unauthorised arrivals returned to their home country; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 funding to support the development of technical and physical assistance to border control agencies in transit countries to help them combat people smuggling. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 New and Upgraded Detention Facilities

 Mr Ruddock said the Government is implementing a long-term strategy to increase detention accommodation for those caught entering Australia illegally or overstaying their visas.

 Two new detention facilities will be built in Darwin and Brisbane and existing facilities will be upgraded.

 The Minister said the location of the new sites was also consistent with the Government's commitment to bring jobs and new business to rural and regional Australia. The new detention arrangements include:

 $52.1 million over four years to establish a 500-bed Immigration Reception and Processing Centre at Darwin, primarily for unauthorised boat arrivals, and a 200-bed centre at Brisbane to accommodate unauthorised air arrivals and overstayers; and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the redevelopment of detention facilities at Maribyrnong in Melbourne, a long-term plan to replace the Perth Airport centre, and refocussing the ongoing redevelopment of the Villawood centre in Sydney to reflect changing needs.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Migrant Numbers Increase

 The Minister said that increasing the number of places available to people migrating through the Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program by 6,000 to 76,000 places would deliver additional economic, budgetary and employment benefits.

 The Humanitarian Program intake for 2000-2001 will remain unchanged at 12,000, and the program will be supplemented by any unused places rolled over from this year's program.

 Mr Ruddock said the changes to the Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program included:

 increasing the skill stream proportion of the total migration program to nearly 53 per cent; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 retaining the 5,000-place contingency reserve in the skill stream for use by employers, regional authorities and State/Territory Governments; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introducing, subject to legislative arrangements, a contingency reserve of 4,000 places under a new permanent visa class for aged parents. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Mr Ruddock said: "The Government believes it is important to send a clear message that while it will not tolerate the activities of people smugglers or the illegal entry of people into Australia, there are legal ways for people to come to this country and a key way of doing this is through the migration program."
