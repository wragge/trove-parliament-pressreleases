 Budget 2009-10 - New Directions in Detention 

 Tuesday, 12 May 2009 

 The Australian Government has committed $77.4 million over four years to  implement key immigration compliance and detention policy improvements in  community care, status resolution and assisted voluntary returns, the Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today. 

 Following last July’s landmark speech announcing the Government’s policy, New  Directions in Detention, and ongoing administrative changes to reflect the  Government’s new detention values, the new funding addresses the need for the  prompt resolution of people’s immigration status while they remain in the community. 

 ‘The Government’s commitment in resolving the status of those in the community  means there will be an increased capacity to assist people to reach a timely  immigration outcome without the need for detention,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘These measures support the principles that indefinite detention is not acceptable  and that those people who have no right to remain in Australia either leave  voluntarily or are removed. 

 ‘The measures provide integrated initiatives to actively, efficiently and effectively  manage those in the community to an immigration outcome through early  intervention and provision of needs-based support or assistance.’ 

 The measures will allow the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) to  tailor flexible and appropriate solutions to clients’ particular circumstances by: 

 â¢ actively managing clients who require some  intervention to resolve their case through the  formal introduction of a national Community  Status Resolution Service  

 â¢ providing an assisted voluntary return service to  facilitate a client’s departure from the  community without the need to detain first, and  

 â¢ providing a package of services including health  and welfare support, together with immigration  advice and assistance to vulnerable clients with  exceptional circumstances, in order to facilitate  resolution of their status.  

 The Government will also introduce more flexible work rights arrangements for  asylum seekers. 

 Senator Evans said the cost of providing these services would be offset through  DIAC savings on existing immigration detention outlays. 

 ‘Collectively, these measures advance the Government’s commitment in resolving  people’s immigration status expeditiously. Improving support for vulnerable people in  the community improves their prospect of voluntary departure from Australia, where  this is the appropriate outcome,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘They also reflect the Government’s determination to implement a humane and risk-based approach to detention. For example, appropriate health and welfare support  means families, who otherwise may be detained, can instead be managed humanely  in the community.’ 

 The early intervention strategy which underpins this measure was formally tested  through the Community Care Pilot. The measure builds on, and continues, the work  of the Community Care Pilot, which is due to expire on June 30. 

 ‘Early intervention, together with targeted assistance to particularly vulnerable  clients, is critical in reaching accelerated, appropriate immigration outcomes for our  clients,’ Senator Evans said.
