 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 8 November 2013   

 Greens move to end Tony Abbott’s reign of  silence on boat arrivals   

 The Australian Greens will move an Order for Production of Documents in the first week of  Parliament which will force the Abbott government to be up front with the public when it comes  to refugee boat arrivals, turn-backs and rescue operations as they happen.   

 “This government’s reign of secrecy has to end,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “After the Immigration Minister’s absurd performance in his weekly briefing it’s clear that this  government will have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to transparency.   

 “Reports of an incident today appear to have uncovered a botched turn-back, but the Minister  doesn’t want anyone to know about it.   

 “It’s clear that Mr Morrison’s excuses are starting to wear thin.   

 “The Greens want to end the secrecy and I am calling on the Labor Party to support our move  for an open and accountable government.”
