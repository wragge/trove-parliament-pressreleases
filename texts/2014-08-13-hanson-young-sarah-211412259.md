 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, August 13, 2014   

 Greens congratulate ‘Love Finds a Way’ protesters as court dismisses charges   

 The Australian Greens have congratulated a group of South Australian faith leaders,  who protested the Abbott government’s cruel treatment of refugees, as charges against  them were dismissed today.   

 “Today’s decision shows just how out of step the Abbott government’s cruelty really is,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Religious and community leaders have been standing up for vulnerable people and  protesting against the government’s cruelty across the country.   

 “It’s time the Abbott government listened to the growing concern in the community and  released all of the children it currently has locked up behind bars.   

 “Whether the children are in Inverbrackie in the Adelaide hills or languishing in the hell-hole on Nauru, their mental health is being damaged beyond repair. The Abbott  Government is knowingly creating the next damaged generation.   

 “The Greens will continue to work with these community members who are standing up  for a better way on refugees. I congratulate them for their courage and compassion in  supporting these vulnerable children.”
