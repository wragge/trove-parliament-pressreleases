 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/980 WEDNESDAY 29 SEPTEMBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS & SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  Refugee Victims of 2001 Election Campaign Still Suffer The Australian Democrats have vowed to ensure that the thousands of refugees and asylum seekers harmed by the policies put in place during the last election campaign will not be forgotten. "There are still hundreds of people, including children, still being traumatised in long-term immigration detention, one for over six years," said Democrats' Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett releasing the party's comprehensive refugee package in Adelaide today.  Senator Bartlett, who is the only federal politician to have visited the refugees imprisoned on Nauru, said there were many people still suffering as a direct result of Government policy since before the 2001 Federal election, who must not be forgotten. "The Government refuses to even monitor the fate of people deported from Australia, despite the unanimous recommendation of a Senate Committee. A new report by the Edmund Rice Centre - the first real research into deportations - found that "there is no doubt that our current refugee protection system is in urgent need of reform."  "There are thousands of people who were the victims of the last election campaign.  Three years on, many are still suffering.  Many lives remain in limbo, with no security and few rights.  Families continue to be separated and despair flourishes amongst the insecure and uncertain future facing so many refugees and asylum seekers. These innocent victims have had their lives destroyed and damaged by the Liberal Government, often with the direct consent of the ALP.   "As the Edmund Rice Centre report shows, many are not protected against the prospect of being deported to unsafe locations and situations." "There are still people being kept in isolation, out of sight on Nauru and Christmas Island.  "There are still thousands of people in the community only on temporary visas, uncertain of their future and some of them denied even the most basic assistance.  Many of these people are also at risk of being deported to unsafe locations with little warning. Continued.

 "Nobody has done more in the Senate than the Democrats to continue to fight for justice for refugees  and asylum seekers.  Only by keeping the Senate strong and the Democrats in the Senate balance  of power can we be sure the battle to obtain justice and reverse the harm can be continued." 

 The Democrats package calls for a comprehensive review of the Migration Act and refugee and visa  determination procedures to identify and remove the many breaches of basic human rights law and  principles that have now become commonplace. 

 The package also calls for an end to the temporary protection visas which keep families separated  and lives in limbo, an end to mandatory and indefinite detention and an end to the farcical Pacific  Solution. The massive and continuing human suffering cannot be justified. 

 

 Key measures of Democrats refugee package: 

 â¢ A formal review of the Migration Act, the refugee and visa determination processes to bring it  back into line with basic human rights principles and Conventions; 

 â¢ Adoption of the unanimous Senate Committee recommendation to monitor the fate of people  deported to potentially unsafe locations; 

 â¢ Scrapping of Temporary Protection Visas for refugees; 

 â¢  Scrapping  mandatory  indefinite detention; 

 â¢ Ending the Pacific Solution and providing visas for all those still detained on Nauru.
