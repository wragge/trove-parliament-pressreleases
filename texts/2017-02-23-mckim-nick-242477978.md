 Media Release: US deal chaos causing uncertainty for people seeking asylum 

 February 23, 2017 

 The government's confusion over the US refugee â€œdeal" is creating further anxiety and  uncertainty for people who have already suffered for far too long, Greens Immigration  spokesperson Nick McKim says. 

 "While the government argues with itself over whether or not this is a people swap, there are  men, women and children suffering in Australia's inhumane detention centres due to the  ongoing uncertainty," Senator McKim said. 

 "This 'deal' was apparently signed more than three months ago, yet not a single person has  been resettled in the United States." 

 "From statements on the record, we know that this agreement does not oblige President  Trump to accept a single person from Manus Island or Nauru." 

 "The simplest way for to resolve the impasse is for Maclolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton to  close the camps and bring the people detained offshore to Australia."
