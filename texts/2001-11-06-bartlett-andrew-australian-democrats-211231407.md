  Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 06 November 2001  MEDIA RELEASE  01/701              

 Democrats: Politicians ‘choke’ on refugee issue The cracks appearing in the Coalition and the ALP over their stance on refugees highlights the bankrupt nature of the bipartisan support for the Government’s current policy, according to the Australian Democrats.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said it is significant that several MPs and candidates, including Western Australian Liberal, Julie Bishop, prominent Liberal Party member and political apirant, Greg Barns and Labor candidate for New England, Annette McCarthy, have chosen to voice their concerns during the election campaign.

 “A number of Coalition and ALP MPs and candidates have had second thoughts about their respective party’s stance on refugees, and this is not surprising considering the refugee policy is not working,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Over the past few days, we’ve been hearing voices of concern and criticism from within the two major parties, but it now seems politicians on both sides of politics are seemingly ‘choking’ on the refugee issue.

 “It is of great concern that the Liberals and the ALP appear to have gagged MPs and candidates on this issue when a proper debate about refugee policy is needed.

 “There are also reports today that Minister Ruddock’s own department has revealed that the Government’s hard-line refugee policy is not working.

 “Close to 2000 people have attempted to come to Australia over the past two months - nearly four times as many as for the same period last year.

 “Australia’s newly implemented Border Protection and Migration Bills are failing to deter desperate and frightened people - the numbers arriving prove that.

 “This is despite the Government splurging millions of Australian taxpayer dollars on bribing poorer foreign governments, to take on our refugee responsibility, and ‘investing’ in the use of Australia’s naval resources to detain and transport asylum seekers for incarceration on isolated Pacific islands,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “For weeks and weeks, Prime Minister Howard and Minister Ruddock have claimed that the refugee problem is easing, but nothing could be further from the truth. The boats keep coming, and will continue to come.

 “Both Mr Howard and Mr Ruddock have argued that other Asia-Pacific nations should be taking more refugees, but Australia can’t seriously expect other countries to take greater numbers of refugees when we are seen to be aggressively and hard-heartedly turning people away, knowing that many of these people are genuine refugees,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “As the Democrats have said before, the issue of refugees is a global problem and requires a global solution. Unless Australia recognises and acknowledges its global role and responsibilities in this process, the refugee issue will not be resolved - Australia’s mismanagement and inhumanity is likely to condemn hundreds of innocent people to death or torment,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
