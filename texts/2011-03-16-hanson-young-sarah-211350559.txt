 Use of force on asylum seekers inappropriate:  Greens   

 Confirmation from the Government that the Australian Federal Police did in fact use synthetic bullets  on asylum seekers held on Christmas Island over the weekend, further highlights the terrible  problems with the Government's mandatory detention policy, said the Australian Greens.   

 “The use of synthetic bullets coupled with tear gas, on vulnerable people who have fled persecution  and torture, seems to be an excessive use of force,” said the Australian Greens Spokesperson on  Immigration, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.   

 “The Minister for Immigration must reveal who authorised this use of force; confirm when he was first  made aware of the decision to take this course of action; and, what possible justification could have  been given for using synthetic bullets and tear gas on asylum seekers?   

 “The Minister’s comments that these bullets simply cause bruising dismisses the psychological harm  that this force may have on vulnerable people  who are already suffering trauma from the torture and  persecution that they have fled as asylum seekers.   

 “The independent investigation must address the circumstances surrounding the reasons for the  growing tensions within the immigration detention network, and what duty of care both the  Immigration Department, and Serco, have to the asylum seekers detained, and whether or not they  have been breached,” said Senator Hanson-Young
