 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS  AFFAIRS

 Push for more Migrants to Settle in Regional NT

 VPS 006/2004

 More and more migrants are settling in the Northern Territory under regional migration initiatives.

 In 2002-03, some 130 visas were granted to people under State-specific and regional migration initiatives for the Northern  Territory.

 This is an increase of approximately 132 percent over the 2001-02 financial year. 

 Since 1997-98 some 550 visas have been granted to people who were planning to settle in the Northern Territory under the  various regional migration programs.

 The Acting Prime Minister, John Anderson, and I today announced a series of new measures to attract more migrants and  refugees to Australia's regional areas.

 Visa grants for regional areas are steadily increasing, but more can be done to assist regional Australia to get the people they  want and this is what the measures being announced today aim to do.

 From 1 July, qualified people who want to come to Australia as skilled migrants will be able to obtain a three-year temporary  residence visa if they commit to living and working in regional Australia. After two years they will be able to apply for  permanent residency.

 There is also a new visa for self-funded independent retirees to encourage them to settle in regional areas.

 Under this visa, participating state and territory governments will be able to sponsor self-funded retirees settling in regional  Australia. 

 Self-funded retirees provide an opportunity for Australia to benefit both from their capital investment and the money they  spend while in Australia.

 In 2002-03, approximately 8,000 visas were granted in Australia under State- specific and regional migration initiatives, an  increase of 92% over the 2001-02 program year.
