 "Recent experience has shown that the refugee system, and particularly the review phase, must deliver decisions which are seen by the community to be impartial and well-grounded," he said.

 Mr Hand said the newly-appointed Members, together with additional Members and Registrars, would work to ensure that the necessary arrangements were made to allow the Tribunal to fulfil its charter.

 This would include setting up RRT registries in Sydney and Melbourne, recruiting staff, and establishing operational procedures which would be fair, economical, informal and quick.

 "I have no doubt that every person who seeks a review of a refugee decision will be well served by the new Tribunal," Mr Hand said.
