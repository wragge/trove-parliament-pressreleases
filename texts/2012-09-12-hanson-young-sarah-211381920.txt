 MEDIA RELEASE 

 12 September 2012 

 A sorry day for human rights and compassion as Parliament approves indefinite detention 

 The Australian Greens today condemned the passing of the Nauru designation instrument as the  Government and Coalition voted down Greens amendments that would have limited the harm  caused to refugees by the Gillard government’s new Pacific ‘Solution’. 

 "Labor and the Coalition have given the green light to dump children, unaccompanied minors and  pregnant women in prison camps on Nauru indefinitely with no protections, against the expert  advice of humanitarian organisations including the UN” said Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  

 "Rather than caring for refugees Labor and the Coalition have lined up together to pass laws that will  cost vulnerable people’s lives, inflict damage to children and fail to stop desperate asylum seekers  taking boat journeys.  

 "The truth is neither Labor or Tony Abbott can be trusted to treat refugees humanely, and today  they have joined forces to make sure they don’t have to.  

 "Both Labor and the Coalition voted against putting a time limit on how long Australia will leave  refugees in detention and have refused to establish an independent health panel to monitor the  welfare and care of those left on Nauru.  

 “The UNHCR and the Houston Panel both listed key welfare protections that are the absolute  minimum necessary to care for refugees who have their applications processed offshore, but those  details and protections are non-existent in the designation that Parliament has today approved.   

 “The Greens and refugee experts know that we can protect and care for refugees by giving them  hope that they can be safely resettled directly from Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan without  boarding a boat. 

 “The boats are still coming because the punishment of being dumped on Nauru does not deter  desperate people. What has the Australian government done to get out on the ground in Indonesia  and let people know that they have the chance of a safer pathway and a visa if they don’t take a  boat? 

 “The Greens have always said that punitive offshore dumping will not work as a deterrent but giving  people safer pathways than a risky boat will. 

 “The Gillard's Pacific ‘Solution’ is a cruel hoax that won't save lives, will inflict more suffering to  refugees, flouts the Refugee Convention, and will cost Australian tax-payers billions of dollars.
