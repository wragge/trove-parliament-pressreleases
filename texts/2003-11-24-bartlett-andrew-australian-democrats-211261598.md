 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Immigration Spokesperson    November 24, 2003                        MEDIA RELEASE                       03/839            

 

 Thousands of Islands Back in Australian Zone   

 The Government’s excessive move to excise thousands of Australian islands from the migration  zone was disallowed today.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, won Senate support to disallow the move imposed by  the Government in response to 14 Turkish Kurds who arrived on Melville Island seeking asylum.   

 “Excising the thousands of islands from the Australian Migration Zone was a massive over-reaction  by the Government and a crude attempt to instill fear in the community about people seeking  asylum in this country,” Senator Bartlett said   

 “The Government must come clean on the Minasa Bone incident.  The Government over-reacted, it  misled the Australian people, and it has been caught out.   

  “The Government excised parts of Australia from the Migration Zone simply to put people beyond  the reach of the courts and the rule of the law.   

 “Northern Territory Supreme Court Justice Dean Mildren last week even accused the Government  of clandestine behaviour over the 14 asylum seekers.   

 “The Government owes it to the Australian people to stop fudging the truth.   

 “The Government must also admit it’s actions do not target people smugglers, as it claims. Instead,  they target refugees.   

  “This Government’s moves are designed to make refugees suffer. Thousands of them are living in  the Australian community in fear. They face an uncertain future and are being kept forcibly  separated from their families.”
