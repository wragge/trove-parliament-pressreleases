 The Hon Stephen Smith MP  AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 Media release 

 14 August 2008 

 Australian Humanitarian Assistance  Following Conflict in Georgia  Australia will provide $1 million to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance to people  adversely affected following the conflict in Georgia. 

 The recent conflict has caused the displacement of over 100,000 people according to  estimates by both the Government of Georgia and the Russian Federation.  

 The International Committee of the Red Cross reports 2,000 dead and a further 3,500  injured.  

 To help address immediate humanitarian needs, Australia has committed $500,000 to the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to provide urgently needed  relief to the displaced including shelter, blankets and water. 

 A further $500,000 has been allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross  (ICRC) for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of  field hospitals for critical surgery in Gori and South Ossetia. 

 ICRC assistance will also include distribution of hygiene kits and access to clean drinking  water.  

 Australia has also agreed to the deployment of two Australian humanitarian technical  experts to support the United Nations Childrens' Fund, UNICEF, in restoring water and  sanitation to affected areas.  

 UNHCR and ICRC are well-established in Georgia including South Ossetia and Abkahzia.  Their ongoing support in these areas dates from the 1992 conflict.  

 Australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which  commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions  held before the conflict broke out, there have been reports of ongoing military action by  Russian forces.

 Australia calls on Russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire, respect the territorial  integrity of Georgia and resolve its differences with Georgia through peaceful means.  

 The military action taken by Russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in  widespread damage and heavy casualties.  

 Australia looks to both Georgia and Russia to immediately implement the terms of the  ceasefire agreement so as to ensure that conditions on the ground are safe for the  immediate and effective delivery of aid.  

 The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise Australians not to travel  to Georgia.
