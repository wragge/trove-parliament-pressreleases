 2008-09 International Development Assistance Budget    

 The 2008-09 Budget lays the foundation for implementing the Government’s  long-term commitment to increase Australia’s Official Development  Assistance (ODA) to 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI) by 2015-16.    

 Australia will provide an estimated $3.7 billion in ODA in 2008-09, increasing  Australia’s ratio of ODA to GNI from 0.30 per cent in 2007-08 to 0.32 per cent  in 2008-09.  The Government expects to increase Australia’s ODA to levels  equivalent to 0.35 per cent of GNI in 2009-10, 0.37 per cent of GNI in 2010-11  and 0.38 per cent of GNI in 2011-12.     

 The new measures contained in this Budget give effect to the Government’s  election commitments to address climate change adaptation needs, establish  Australian leadership on disability and eliminating avoidable blindness and  improve access to clean water and sanitation.     

 The 2008-09 Budget increases the focus of the program on practical  development outcomes, promoting faster progress towards the Millennium  Development Goals (MDGs) and greater attention to alleviating the situation  of the vulnerable.    

 In 2008-09 Australia will scale up expenditure in major sectors influencing  MDG outcomes, including education (up 5 per cent), health (up 8 per cent),  rural development (up 7 per cent), environment (up 7 per cent) and  infrastructure (up 17 per cent).  Assistance to help the most vulnerable,  particularly those who suffer disability or who are refugees or victims of  humanitarian crisis, will also increase.  

 

 

 Budget Highlights   

 Making faster progress towards the MDGs   

 The Australian Government is committed to helping developing country  partners attain the MDGs.  Most developing countries in the Asia-Pacific  region can claim progress in meeting some of the MDGs, however, none is on  course to achieve them all.  Making faster progress on the MDGs requires a  concerted and well-coordinated global response.   

 Australia‘s development assistance helps partners expand economic activity  to create jobs and raise incomes, combat disease and improve nutrition, raise  basic educational attainment, and improve the responsiveness and  accountability of the state in meeting citizens’ basic needs. 

 The  Government  will  increase  Australia’s  multilateral  engagement,  through   increased  multilateral  development  financing  and  a  major  increase  of   $200 million over four years in Australia’s core funding for key UN agencies  leading efforts to achieve the MDGs. 

 New multi-year allocations are made to improve access to clean water and  basic sanitation ($300 million over three years) and to meet high priority  climate adaptation needs in vulnerable countries ($150 million over three  years), implementing the election commitments made by the Government.   

 Priority will be given to helping the Pacific and Papua New Guinea achieve  the MDGs through expanded assistance in 2008-09.  New programs focusing  on infrastructure development, land administration and public sector capacity  building will contribute to the Pacific Partnerships for Development outlined  in the Prime Minister’s March 2008 Port Moresby Declaration. The  partnerships will provide a new framework for Australia and the Pacific  island nations to commit jointly to achieving improved development  outcomes, on the basis of mutual respect and mutual responsibility.   

 Addressing the needs of the vulnerable   

 Action to address disadvantage and vulnerability is essential to alleviating  poverty in our region. The most vulnerable include those who suffer  disability or who are refugees or victims of humanitarian crisis.  They are cut  off from access to basic services and the opportunity to improve their quality  of life.   

 A significant scaling up in assistance for some of the most vulnerable - those  suffering avoidable blindness and people with disabilities - will commence in  2008-09, piloting approaches to better eye and vision care and developing a  strategy for addressing disability needs through the development assistance  program.   

 Increasing assistance will be provided to new partners including Iraq and  Afghanistan in transition from conflict. Increased assistance will support  vulnerable civilian populations and help underpin reconstruction. 

 

 

 Further details on development assistance initiatives in the 2008-09 Budget  are provided below.   

 

 Access to Clean Water and Effective Sanitation   

 Australia will invest $300 million over three years, with $8 million in  2008-09, to address the critical challenge to health and wellbeing posed by  inadequate access to clean water and sanitation.  

 This initiative will improve access for the poor to clean water and effective  sanitation in urban, peri-urban and rural areas and provide more predictable  water supply by protecting fresh water sources.  Better management of water  resources and improved sanitation will reduce the transmission of disease  and lead to improved health for poor people, particularly women and  children.   

 Adaptation to Climate Change   

 Australia will invest $150 million over three years, with $35 million in  2008-09, to meet urgent climate change adaptation needs in vulnerable  countries in Australia’s region.   

 Funding will support improved scientific information on climate change  impacts, more effective strategic planning and vulnerability assessments and  the implementation of high priority adaptation measures, for example, by 

 better protecting infrastructure from extreme weather events and securing  fresh water supplies.  Funding will increase planning and investment in  responses that reduce the vulnerability of communities.  Support will  address specific country and regional needs, for example, better  management of the Mekong river basin, better urban planning in the mega-cities of Asia,  and measuring sea level change, modelling sea inundation  and assessing coastal vulnerability in Pacific island states. 

 Fighting Avoidable Blindness   

 Australia will invest $45 million over two years on meetings its election  commitment to help eliminate avoidable blindness in the region and on  establishing a comprehensive strategy for addressing disability in partner  developing countries.  

 Most funding will be used to support a pilot eye and vision care program to  address blindness and vision impairment, including by expanding the  number of qualified eye health workers. 

 UN Partnership for MDGs   

 Australia will invest an additional $200 million over four years to strengthen  partnerships with key United Nations development agencies.  

 

 

 Australian development assistance will boost the capacity of UNICEF, WHO,  UNFPA, UNIFEM, UNDP, UNOCHA, and UNAIDS to lead global efforts to  realise the Millennium Development Goals.  Core funding for these  organisations enable Australia to contribute to work on issues as diverse as  increasing child literacy, improving maternal and child health and the  empowerment of women in countries beyond our own region. 

 Pacific Land Program   

 Australia will invest $54 million over four years, with $6.5 million in  2008-09, to protect customary land rights, promote economic and social  development, and reduce the potential for instability through land-related  conflict in the Pacific.  

 Assistance will support partner government-led improvements in land  administration.  Australian funding will help address the challenges to land  use and ownership from urbanisation.  Clarification of land title is a key 

 prerequisite for private investment. Funding will also improve the skills of  professionals and semi-professionals in areas such as planning, surveying  and valuing. 

 Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility   

 Australia will invest $127 million over four years, with $5.5 million in 2008-09, to improve basic infrastructure services in the Pacific. 

 Targeted support to Pacific island nations will address local constraints to  growth and challenges to nation building and stability.  Australian funding  for improved infrastructure services in both rural and urban areas including  transport, water, sanitation, waste management, energy and communications  will facilitate growth and enable more Pacific islanders to participate in the  development process. 

 Investing in Pacific Public Sector Capacity   

 Australia will invest $107 million over four years, with $6 million in 2008-09,  to strengthen public sector administration in the Pacific.  

 Funding will improve public sector performance by supporting management  and policy reform, while also providing immediate assistance to improve  individual and institutional capacity in priority areas as identified by partner  governments in the region.  The inititive will address a key impediment to  poverty reduction, by helping to improve service delivery and enable growth.

 Afghanistan Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance   

 Australia will contribute $62 million in 2008-09, through AusAID, in  humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan to help meet the  basic health, education and food needs of Afghans living in Afghanistan and  the reintegration and protection of Afghans from bordering countries. 

 Total Australian Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Afghanistan in  2008-09 is estimated to total $122 million, including AusAID expenditure and  ODA-eligible expenditure by other government departments.   

 Assistance with ongoing humanitarian needs will be complemented by  assistance focused on rebuilding a stable Afghanistan.  Australian assistance  will strengthen the capacity, transparency and accountability of the Afghan  Government and administration (including in law enforcement).  

 Australian assistance will help build government and civil society capacity to  deliver improved basic services, promote human rights awareness and  support community-led recovery.  Australia will also provide land mine risk  education and removal, in addition to rehabilitation assistance for those  injured by land mines. 

 In addition to assistance delivered at the national level, in Oruzgan Province  and on the border region with Pakistan, Australia will support local  reconstruction and technical training.  

 

 Iraq Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance   

 Australia will provide $140 million over three years, with $60 million in  2008-09, for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction priorities and to  assist in building the capacity of the Iraqi Government in key sectors. 

 The Australian Government’s enhanced package of assistance will help meet  the immediate humanitarian needs of Iraq’s vulnerable civilian population by  providing access to essential food items, emergency shelter, clean water and  adequate sanitation and basic health services.  It will improve Iraqi  Government capacity and assist reconstruction efforts in Iraq by improving 

 basic services, particularly in agriculture, and supporting mine risk education. 

 To deliver this assistance, the Government will work closely with key  international humanitarian and development agencies including the  International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme and the UN Children’s  Fund (UNICEF).
