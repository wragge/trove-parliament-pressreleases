 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 Lawyers should have access to Burmese clients 

 

 Senator Nettle, 19th August 2006 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the government to allow the  Burmese asylum seekers now on Christmas Island full access to their lawyer and for  them to be brought to Australia while their claims are processed. 

 "It is great that the asylum seekers have managed to make a written request for a  lawyer. Now the government must allow the lawyers full access to their clients," said  Senator Nettle. 

 "Asylum seekers access to lawyers should not rely on them being able to contact a  lawyer. The government needs to ensure that all asylum seekers are offered legal  support. 

 "The best way to ensure the Burmese asylum seekers have full access to their lawyer  is to bring them to Australia while their asylum claims are assessed. 

 "These asylum seekers must not be taken to Nauru. A major problem with off-shore  processing is that asylum seekers are isolated from legal assistance. In the past,  lawyers have been denied visas to Nauru and have not been able to take instructions  from their clients. 

 "The treatment of the Burmese asylum seekers will be a test of whether the  government truly believes asylum seekers should have access to legal assistance, or  whether their recent promises regarding this were simply a ploy to convince  backbenchers to support their plan to send all asylum seekers to Nauru. 

 "Why should these Burmese asylum seekers be treated worse than the West Papuans?  The Australian government has recognized the horrendous human rights abuses that  continue to occur in Burma."
