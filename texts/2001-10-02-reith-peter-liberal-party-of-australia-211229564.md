 SPEECH The Hon. Peter Reith, MP Minister for Defence

  

 02 Oct 2001 MIN 21001/01

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PETER REITH MP

 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - SYDNEY

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Reith, the people on board Tobruk, are they going to be taken to Nauru or will they be now taken to Christmas Island?

 REITH:

 No, they are going to Nauru. The Nauruan Government put out a statement last weekend saying that they would accept additional persons [inaudible]…Tobruk is headed towards Nauru.

 JOURNALIST:

 Will they be forced off like the people on board Manoora?

 REITH:

 Well, obviously we will talk to them about the Australian Government’s policy for unauthorised boat arrivals. The situation in respect of Manoora is, as you would know, the people off the Tampa have all disembarked and some have moved on to New Zealand. We have been talking with the additional group from the ACENG and we have as a country have been extremely patient with these people. They have been well fed, they have been well clothed, they have been well looked after but ultimately they are not coming to Australia and they do not have any rights to remain on board HMAS Manoora. And we have made that very clear and as a result of all the discussions and negotiations and the like in the end after consultation with the Nauruan Government we have decided that enough was enough and it was time that they went ashore.

 JOURNALIST:

 Will the Nauruan Government allow that to happen?

 REITH:

 Well, I filled in Rene Harris yesterday morning in a conversation and the Chief Secretary, Matthew Batsui(?) in advance of us commencing action and went through in some detail the likely course of action. Basically my advice in respect of the first group was that things went reasonably smoothly although one of the number of six was pretty intent on making life a bit difficult and resisted and so there was pressure obviously to move him on. In respect of the second group I have not had a, sort of, moment by moment detail of exactly what happened. I have seen some of the film clips. In the first group one of the six made it quite clear that you know he’d be putting on a show for the Australian press, there’s no doubt about that. He was quite up-front. As to the second group I cant give you details, Laurie, because I have not had a personal detailed explanation.

 But look, they are coming off there’s no question about this and we have been extremely reasonable about this. We have negotiated, we have sat down, we have talked, we have been patient in every possible way. These people do not have a right to come to Australia. That has been explained to them in their own language, in writing and the like. So I don’t think there’s anything else we can reasonably do and we do not intend having them on the boats.

 JOURNALIST:

 Does the International Migration Organisation, will they accept them if they are removed by force onto Nauru……

 REITH:

 Well, that is a matter for IOM, I mean, they have just had a changeover in personnel. I mean, I did have the opportunity to talk to Mark Gatchell(?) who has just left, I think he left two or three days ago. I spoke to him when I was in Nauru a couple of weeks ago about our general policy approach and they have been very supportive I must say. I have not spoken to the new person about the operation in the last day or two in removing people. But look, ultimately that is a matter for IOM. But look, no-one can have any doubt Australia has acted very reasonably, very patiently, and yes, we did make sure that we were able to manage the thing with these people coming off so they had a member of the ADF on each shoulder and that’s simply because we didn’t want people to be trying to make a show any more than necessary.

 JOURNALIST:

 But what is Mark Gatchell’s(?) replacement telling you now? Are they [inaudible]….

 REITH:

 I have not personally spoken to him. We have got our people on Nauru who are holding those discussions.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]…….Australian Government….

 REITH:

 Well, I can’t give you a word by word description of what has been said with IOM in the last 12

 hours, I am sorry.

 JOURNALIST:

 Was it the problem with the Manoora that delayed the election to stop Mr Howard calling it yesterday?

 REITH:

 Oh, no, no, no, not to my knowledge no.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]…….of the so-called blockades to the north of Australia. Labor is saying it’s basically being dismantled, there’s not as many [inaudible]…

 REITH:

 Well, I must say I am quite disappointed by the Labor Party’s attitude. I gave Steve Martin a private briefing after, what, Monday a week ago or Tuesday a week ago and told him exactly what we were doing. We were quite clear with him. When I announced that we were continuing the operation I made the statement that we would not be detailing the movements of frigates or otherwise. The Labor Party thinks that this is a point they can score in support of their Coast Guard proposal. I have no intention whatsoever of making detailed announcements of Australian ship movements to the north.

 JOURNALIST:

 But you made a detailed announcement when you put it there why won’t you announce when you take them away?

 REITH:

 Well, we did it very simply, Laurie, because we were sending a message that we had naval units to the north to deal with the situation. And again, I make no apology for that either.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]…

  

 REITH:

 Well, we are maintaining the capability that we have had there in terms of being able to do the job and I have done that on military advice. But if the Labor Party wants to make a political point out of this just for their silly Coast Guard proposal well, we will obviously challenge their proposal.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you deny you are keeping it a secret because it’s an electoral embarrassment that you are

 pulling your ships out?

 REITH:

 I rang the Labor Party and gave them specific details of what we are doing Laurie.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Well, I did it for the one reason and there’s no reason whatsoever for this to be a political opportunity for the Labor Party to buttress its arguments in respect of a Coast Guard which…

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]….Government when you announced you were sending the ships there.

 REITH:

 Well, it was part of an overall plan to send a clear message that Australia would not be continuing to allow people just to arrive unasked for and then demanding access into our system.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]…you have pulled them out.

 REITH:

 Well, no, pull out is your words, Laurie. I have not detailed what frigates we have got there but we still have frigates there and we are still maintaining with the assets that we have the same surveillance coverage that we had in the first three weeks and we will continue with that operation because it has been effective and therefore that’s the reason we are doing it. As to why we are not providing details well, because there are operational reasons why we don’t need to specify to people smugglers exactly what we are doing. It’s as simple as that.

 JOURNALIST:

 When it comes to anti-terrorism then, particularly on civil aircraft, have the United States made any representation if we want to fly our planes to Los Angeles [inaudible]….

 REITH:

 Well, look, John Anderson handles the aviation side and the contacts with the Americans in that regard. If there’s more to be said about that, it can be said later today.
