 SUBJECTS: Coalition superannuation policy; asylum seekers; ANZ job ads; Denis Napthine; election; Melbourne Cup.

 JOURNALIST:

 Treasurer, the peak superannuation body says that the changes you’re making to superannuation is just tinkering around the edges, it doesn’t help people in the $30,000 - $70,000 bracket?

 TREASURER:

 Well I think in this policy there are benefits for a full range of Australians who are interested in superannuation. There are benefits for low income earners, who can have a Government contribution into their superannuation of up to $1000 to match their own contributions. There are benefits for families because you can get a situation where a husband could pay into superannuation on behalf of his wife. There are benefits for children, because we will be announcing a proposal to allow savings to be put into superannuation for children. And there is a reduction in the surcharge rate of 10 per cent per year, for three years, so, it will bring that top rate down from 15 per cent, by 1 ½ per cent a year to 10.5 per cent. So, this is a very broad ranging improvement in superannuation with benefits for families, lower income earners, middle and upper income earners, and for children as well.

 JOURNALIST:

 Is this position at odds with that expressed by you some years ago where you said that the Coalition was the only party with the courage to actually hit those high income earners?

 TREASURER:

 This is an important improvement, I think, which gives benefits to people across all income ranges. And we are able to do this now because, having got our Budget back into balance, and repaid $60 billion worth of Labor Party debt, we can actually reduce some of the taxes and improve benefits. And, once you get your Budget back into balance, and once you repay debt, and we have repaid $60 billion of Labor Party debt, then you do have the opportunity to reduce taxes and we are taking that opportunity in relation to superannuation.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you stand by your comments that the superannuation favours the rich in favour of, as opposed to poor income earners?

 TREASURER:

 No, the superannuation system is designed to encourage all people to put money into superannuation, and so the announcements that we are making today are improving incentives for all people, right across the income ranges, and for families, and also for children. There is some very exciting developments there for children, to be able to put savings away on behalf of children as well.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, you have, you’re a self confessed fan of Julie Bishop’s in the past, and you, her comments that Australia must take more refugees can’t be helpful?

 TREASURER:

 I am not sure that is what she said. I think what she said is, she, like the Government, believes that people can’t just defeat Australia’s immigration laws by coming in on boats, that they have to be properly assessed and that they have to come in under our program. Now, once they are properly assessed, our program allows for, it’s an intake of approximately 12,000 per year. That is the right intake in the view of the Government, and that is the intake which the Government believes is appropriate for the circumstances.

 JOURNALIST:

 And Julie Bishop thinks Australia should take more?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I think you will have to clarify, you will have to clarify her position with her. But as, I have just read the article in one of the local newspapers, I don’t believe she disagreed with the Government at all on its approach to asylum seekers. She believes, I think it was quite clear from the article, that people who want to come into Australia should come in under assessment, under the refugee program. The Government has 12,000 places under that program, and I think that is the appropriate number.

 JOURNALIST:

 The ANZ Bank has found that employment newspaper advertisements dropped by 2.2 per cent in October. Does this concern you?

 TREASURER:

 Well, we would always prefer job vacancies to be strong, of course we’d always prefer strong job vacancies, but at the present, unemployment is 6.7 per cent, and there have been 800,000 new jobs created since this Government came to office, and we are going into a very difficult period. You have seen unemployment rise in the United States, very significantly. The United States economy is most probably in recession. But, Australia is stronger, is growing stronger than the United States at the moment. We won’t be immune to world developments, they will affect us. What we have got to do is we have got to make sure that we keep our economy as strong as possible in the face of those international developments.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, there is renewed speculation that Mr Napthine is under pressure in Melbourne from within his own ranks. Were you surprised at the timing of that, that it has cropped up now? And would you urge the Victorian State Liberals to show a bit more discipline?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I think the important thing for the Liberal Party at the moment is to remain focused on the Federal Election, and I think all Liberals that want to see good government in Australia, want to see the Howard Government returned, will stay focused on that as a priority, and I think that is the important thing to be doing at the moment.

 JOURNALIST:

 So what would be your advice to your State colleagues in Melbourne?

 TREASURER:

 I just say to all Liberals, the important thing is to say focused on the job, the job at hand, and that is the Federal Election. Five days to go, Australia’s future rides on it, let’s stay focused on the task at hand. Thank you.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, what is your tip for the Melbourne Cup?

 TREASURER:

 I am going for Sky Heights. Because, I like the name, I think it has got good blood lines, it has got a good barrier and it has got a good jockey. And Sky Heights for the Melbourne Cup, sky high for the punters, I hope. Thank you.
