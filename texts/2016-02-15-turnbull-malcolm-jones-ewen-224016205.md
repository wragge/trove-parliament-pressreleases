 PRIME MINISTER 

 THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP 

 TRANSCRIPT 

 15 February 2016 

 Joint doorstop with Ewen Jones MP  Lavarack Barracks, Townsville 

 E&OE... 

 EWEN JONES: 

 Can I just say, briefly, it’s a pleasure to have the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Townsville - and at  combat training centre where we see what is great about Australia’s Army. Adapt, innovate, overcome,  challenge yourself which is what we want to do as a city and what we need to do as a nation. 

 So the challenges in front of Townsville are great and the Prime Minister is here in Townsville to see  them first hand and to take those lessons back as we work towards our budget and towards the next  election. 

 It’s an important time for Townsville and it’s a great time to have the Prime Minister here, especially at  the 3 r d Brigade where we do see innovation, adaptability and agility personified in what these young  m en  a nd  wo me n ac tu a ll y do  her e. 

 So, thanks very much for coming, Prime Minister and I’ll hand you over for some questions. 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Thank you. Thanks very much, Ewen - and it is great to be here with you. 

 What an inspiration it is to see how the 21 s t century army is adapting to new challenges, new challenges 

 on the battlef ield, a nd usin g the newes t techno logies  t o ensure that our young me n and women, when  t h ey  g o ou t to  d ef en d ou r na t io n,  d ef en d ou r va lu e s,  pr ot ec t ou r in te re st s , are  d oi n g so  in  a  w a y th at  

 gives them greatest eff ecti veness, th e greatest a bilit y  to succee d and al so give s them the maximum   p ro te ct i on . 

 

 This is very important work here. You can see how - and I've been briefed by the Brigadier and Colonel 

 H i l l - h o w th ey  a re  a da pt ing  to  e ver y  n ew  st ag e of  t ech n ol og y,  e v er y pi ec e of  n ew  i nf orm at io n an d 

 experience coming in from Afghanistan or Iraq is being analysed and then incorporated into the training 

 here. 

 I met only th e other day wit h hundreds of y oung serv ic emen and women  in Iraq w ho had been train ed 

 here. And of course, many of these young soldiers have been to Iraq and Afghanistan and many of them 

 w i l l  b e  d e p l o y e d  t h e r e  w h e n  t h e i r  r o t a t i o n  c o m e s  a r o u n d .  S o ,  t h i s  i s  a  c r i t i c a l l y  i m p o r t a n t  p a r t  o f  

 ensuring Australia's Army is at the very cutting edge of military technology, both in terms of signals and 

 of course, in  terms of mi lita ry technique and traini ng. 

 It's also good to be in Townsville. This is one of the great cities of Australia's north. And we believe in 

 Austral ia's north.  Our north ern Austral ia pol icy, our No rthern Austral ia Infrastru ct ure Fund, is des igned 

 to put subst antial m oney - billion s of dol lars - into i nfrastructure in north ern Au st ralia to ensure that it 

 can realise its great potential. 

 This is the most exciting time to be an Australian. This is the most exciting time for Australia. We have 

 g re at er  o pp ort un i ti es  t ha n w e  h a ve  e ver  h a d be for e.  A n d  t he y ar e no  gr ea te r tha n  h ere  i n no rt he rn  

 Australia. So close, as it is, to the huge expanding markets of Asia, which we have, of course, opened the 

 doors wider with those big trade agreements that Trade Minister Andrew Robb has negotiated over the 

 last few years. 

 So, it's very good to be here and I look forward to your questions. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Prime Minister, today's Fairfax poll appears to suggest some voters having second thoughts about your 

 G o ve rn me nt . W ha t wo u ld  yo u  s ay  t o th o se  v ot er s w ho a pp ear  t o be  h a vi ng  s e co nd  th ou gh ts ? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Well, let me just say this: that the Government's providing the economic leadership that Australia needs 

 and Australians deserve. It's a leadership - an economic leadership - that is based on confidence. And a 

 recognition, that we are at a time of great opportunities and you can see Australians are hearing that 

 message. Last year, there were over 300,000 new jobs created in Australia. That's the largest number of 

 new jobs created in our country since 2006, which is back in the days of the Howard Government and of 

 course well before the Global Financial Crisis. 

 A n d ,  o f  c o u r s e ,  i t ' s  a  t i m e  t o o  w h e n  w e  h a v e  s e e n ,  i n  t h e  l a s t  q u a r t e r  o f  l a s t  y e a r ,  t h e  h i g h e s t

 down, job growth is going up, female participation is going up. These are very strong figures and what 

 needs to be recognised, too, is this resilience is being seen at a time when we are coming off the mining 

 boom. Parti cularly  the min i ng construct ion boom th at' s been felt in Quee nsland and Western  Au stralia 

  JOURNALIST: 

 in particular, but it always had to happen once the mines are built and the big projects are built, then 

 production goes on, but it doesn't employ as many people, obviously. And many folk forecast Australia 

 w o u ld  f al l i nt o so me th in g of  an  e co no mi c  h ol e af te r tha t . B ut  w e 'v e go t a st ro ng , d i ve rs e e co nom y .

 decision s and tha t's w hy yo u're seeing th e numbers we 've had. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 But voters appear to be sending a message that they want to see more, specifically on economic 

 l e ad er sh ip  - do  y o u ac ce pt  t h at ? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Can I tell you, the budget is now less than three months away. And in the lead-up to the budget and at 

 the budget, we wil l lay out  our economic plan for the  year ahead and of course for the election which  

 will be later this year. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Scott Morrison has criticised Labor's proposed changes to the negative gearing system. Where do you 

 see the problem s are w ith Labor's poli cy and where d o you see th ere are exce ss es in the ne gative 

 gearing sys tem that the  Go vernment might be  prepare d to address, or is it too dif ficult? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Well, we are looking at a whole range of matters in the tax area. And we're looking at them very 

 carefully. I know some people would like us to, you know, make instantaneous judgments and 

 instantaneous decisions on complex economic matters. I think that's only a few people, frankly. 

 The truth is that governments have got to work through these issues very carefully, and having done so, 

 then announce them at the proper time. So yes, we are looking at all of these tax issues and negative 

 gearing is one of them. 

 As far as Labor's announcement is concerned, I will make a couple of observations: one is that it raises 

 relatively little money in the near term, over the next 4 years, and they acknowledge that. So it doesn't 

 address the b ig defi cit prob lem we hav e at the mom ent , which I  might add , the La bor Party crea ted. 

 So yet again, they're still addicted to spending and they're not prepared to do anything to address the 

 deficit they've created. 

 The policy as described has been criticised, and I think fairly, as likely to really distort the housing 

 investment market. So it is - it's not a well-designed policy, if I can put it that way. And it doesn't have 

 the - doesn't provide any budgetary relief, at least any time soon. 

  PRIME MINISTER: 

 When it comes to infrastructure, will you be making a commitment to the Townsville Super Stadium any 

 t i me  s oo n? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 The proposal is with Infrastructure Australia at the moment. Again, with these big projects we have to 

 look at them carefull y and i t's being e xamined r ight at the moment. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 What if I nfrastructure Austr alia find s it's  not a v iable p roject, where to next? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Well, we will go through the analysis of the proposal very carefully. Whatever decision is taken will be 

 properly explained at the time. I know - you know, I know there is a - there's often almost a yearning to 

 have snap decisions all the time. The most important thing is that governments approach these issues 

 carefully, thoughtfully, on the basis of the evidence, and then come to a considered decision and that's 

 what we're doing, and all will be revealed in due course. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 And Hell's Gate, you mentioned this in Parliament last week. 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 I did. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 An intere sting propo sal tha t the Government  wil l... 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Well, it's been around for a while. And it's certainly being considered as part of the Water Fund, yes, 

 absolutely. 

 As you know, I have a passion for water. Barnaby Joyce and I share that passion. I was the Water 

 Minister, remember, years ago. I love nothing more than pipelines and dams, but they've got to stack 

 up. They've got to stack up. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Prime Minister, on infrastructure - you had a lot to say about public transport when you first came in. 

 You're going to give a speech later in the week about it. Can you tell us why you demoted the Cities 

 Ministry do wn to a Parl iam entary Se cretary? 

 

 Well, the Cities Ministry has in reality been promoted. Let me explain. The Federal Government spends a 

 lot of money on infrastru ctu re in citie s and tou ches on  cities in many ways,  throug h the infrastruc ture 

 portfolio, through the environment portfolio, and of course, through other investments, housing, social 

 services and so forth. So it is a whole of government issue - communications as well. 

 And yet, to date at least, the Federal Government has not had a holistic approach to cities. One that is 

 d e s i g n e d  t o  e n s u r e  t h at  e ve r y  a n g l e ,  e v e r y  a s p e c t  o f t h e  F e d e r a l  G o v er n m e n t  i s p r o m o t i n g  g r ea t e r  

 amenity in cities, large and small and also greater liveability. You know, that's what we want to achieve. 

 Are we supporting b etter o utcomes for Austral ians? 

 And so what I' ve done is I' m moving the Citie s Un it w hich has b een in th e Depar tment of En vironment -  

 it's es sential ly a po licy  dev elopment unit  -  I'm movi ng that into the Department of  Prime Min ister and 

 Cabinet. 

 So because it has a whole of government impact, it really needs to be in the central agency, the most 

 i m por ta nt  a ge nc y  i n th e gov er nm en t,  wh ic h i s,  o f co ur se , th e P ri me  M in i st er' s ow n  d ep art me nt . S o it 

 will  be th ere in  PM &C  and  I've  appointe d a  really  ou tstanding  young  or ne w M ember of Parliam ent,  

 Angus Taylor, who I think everyone recognised as one of the - has got one of the biggest brains in the 

 room. 

 And I've appointed Angus who's a top-flight economist who's worked a lot in these areas, to assist me in 

 particular on Citie s and an other whole of  government agenda, whi ch is  the dig ital  transformation of 

 government. So that's the reason. 

 So it is actually quite contrary to what's been reported. It's recognising my recognition that Cities and 

 Cities policy is a whole of government agenda and as we develop that policy, it should be developed 

 within PM&C and I have Angus's very considerable talents to assist in that regard. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 [inaudible] ... a Brisbane hospital over a child who's seeking asylum here, doctors at the hospital refuse 

 t o  d i s c h a r g e  t h e  b a b y  f o r  f e a r  o f  h e r  b e i n g  r e t u r n e d  t o  N a u r u .  T h e  I m m i g r a t i o n  M i n i s t e r  h a s  b e e n  

 tellingly silent on the matter. What's your view and do you concede it's not a great look to have doctors 

 withholding babies. 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Can I say to you, we are - and as the Minister has said - as Peter Dutton has said, we are assessing all of 

 these cases carefully on a case by case basis. No decision would be taken which would imperil the health 

 or security of any individual. 

 We're managing this policy with great care. And with great compassion. And at the same time, doing 

 everything we can t o ensur e that we do not do an ythin g or say anyt hing w hich wil l be used b y the 

 people smugg lers to get  m ore vulnerable p eople ont o those boats. 

 

 Let's not forget, let us not forget, when we came into government in 2013, there were 2,000 kids in 

 detention. Now, there's less than 100. And about 75, I believe, last time I checked and the number is  reducing. 

 Peter Dut ton is handlin g thi s very we ll. But it is a d iffic ult job, be cause we have to  do it in a way th at 

 gives no incentive to the people smugglers, who are ruthless, and they are ruthless and they use every  m ed i um , th ey  u se  a l l of  soc i a l m ed i a,  T wi tt er  a nd  Fa ce b oo k an d ev er yt h in g el se , t o pro mo te  t he ir   b u si ne s s,  a nd  we  g iv e t hem  o ne  in ch  o f en c our ag eme n t an d th ere  wi l l be  m ore  p e op le  o n boat s an d  w e ' l l  b e  b a c k  t o  w h a t  w e  h a d  w i t h  t h e  L a b o r  P a r t y ,  I  r e g r e t  t o  s a y ,  w h i c h  w i l l  b e  t h o u s a n d s  o f  

 unauthorised arri vals an d h undreds of peop le drowned  at sea. 

 So that's what we're seeking to do, keeping people safe, keeping our borders secure, acting with  compassion. 

 On that note, I thank you all very much for your questions, and another beautiful day in Townsville. 

 Thank you.
