 STATEMENT BY LEADER OF DELEGATION -  THE HONOURABLE SENATOR  GARETH EVANS O.C ...

 MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE OF   AUSTRALIA

 ASEAN PMC 6 + 6 SESSION WITH AUSTRALIA   6 JULY 1989

 OPENING STATEMENT BY SENATOR GARETH EVANS,  AUSTRALIAN 

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS k TRADE, AT 6 â¦ 6 

 SESSION, ASEAN POST-MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE, BRUNEI, 6 

 JULY 1989.

 May I, at the outset congratulate you, Your Royal

 Highness, on your election as Chairman of this ASEAN / 

 Ministerial Meeting And Post Ministerial Conference.

 I am personally very pleased that this my first visit 

 to this ancient capital of Bandar Seri Begawan should 

 have coincided with the conclusion by Brunei 

 Darussalam of its first year in the chairmanship of 

 the ASEAN Standing Committee, Brunei's successful 

 hosting of ASEAN through this last year is

 certainly reflected in the excellent arrangements 

 which have obviously been made for this meeting and 

 augurs well for the success of "our discussions over 

 the next three days. \

 In the twelve months since the ASEAN PMC .last met we 

 have seen many changes in the international an^ 

 regional environment, changes which have heralded both 

 promise and risk, opportunity and uncertainty.

 The promise and the opportunity have flowed most 

 strikingly from, the welcome moves over the last few 

 years away from East-West confrontation, moves which 

 have gained even further momentum in the last year.

 To the earlier achievements of the INF Treaty and the 

 Afghanistan settlement, we have seen added the peace 

 plan for Namibia, the resumption of the START

 negotiations and solid progress on the complicated but

 crucial question of conventional force reduction· in 

 Europe. We have also seen NATO demonstrate that it is 

 more than ready to respond to new and constructive 

 Soviet policies with an imaginative and comprehensive 

 proposal on European security, reflecting in large 

 part the vision and leadership of President Bush.

 Closer to the region, we saw in May the historic visit 

 to China by President Gorbachev, thereby putting a 

 symbolic seal to a process of normalisation which has 

 the potential signi/icantly to reduce tension in the 

 region.

 In contrast to these positive developments we have in 

 recent weeks witnessed the tragic events which have 

 occurred in China. Respect for human rights has been 

 cast aside in the suppression of the pro-deoocrac.v 

 movement. These actions have caused shock and 

 revulsion throughout the world.

 What has happened in China raises fundamental foreign 

 policy and economic questions "for the region, and  X 

 indeed for the world. There are- no clear answers to 

 these questions at present.

 Chinese leaders have sought to assure the world that 

 the economic reform and open door policies will 

 continue. Only time will be the judge of that, but 

 one cannot escape the conclusion that it was these 

 policies which contributed in part to the aspirations 

 of the pro-deoo‘crac'y movement. It wbuld be a further 

 tragedy if in the suppression of those aspirations, 

 the Chinese leadership also turned its back on 

 economic reform which is not only in China's interests 

 but also in the interests of us all.

 The Australian Government will,  on my return to 

 Australla, be addressing the framework for the longer 

 term conduct of Australia's relations with China in 

 the light of the situation now prevailing. Like many 

 others we believe there is a need to keep the lines of 

 access -and communication with China open across all 

 elements of Chinese society. The Chinese need to be 

 encouraged to pursue the processes of economic reform 

 and liberalisation! and a pragmatic and constructive 

 foreign policy, and we should be trying to find ways 

 of assisting that process.

 In his opening speech to last year's ASEAN PMC my 

 precedessor, Bill Hayden, predicted that we were about 

 to see the first down-payment on peace for Kampuchea/ 

 Cambodia. Over the past twelve months there have 

 been more instalments than most people could have 

 believed possible. That we have come so far so 

 quickly owes an enormous amount to the diligence, 

 imagination and flexibility of Indonesia, Thailand and 

 the other ASEAN States - in their leadership of the 

 JIM process - as well as to the long-overdue 

 announcement by Vietnam of a deadline for the 

 withdrawal of its forces from Cambodia.

 France and Indonesia are now engaged cooperatively in 

 the mounting of an international conference in Paris 

 next month. It is our hope that that conference will 

 facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive and 

 durable settlement of the Cambodian problem: Australia 

 very much endorses, in this respect, the central theme 

 of the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting Communique, that a 

 durable settlement must lie one that i* comprehensive - 

 in which external and internal aspects of the problem 

 are treated as integrally linked.

 >

 The principal parties in the Cambodian conflict now 

 acknowledge that it ie time for a resolution. There 

 are clear Indications that the international community 

 ia sympathetic towards supporting a viable settlement 

 and to assist in facilitating it. There is an evident 

 preparedness in principle to guarantee the 

 independence and neutrality of a new Cambodia and to 

 search for practical means of assuring the terms of 

 any durable settlement. It would be a great pity - 

 and the waste of a great opportunity - if in these 

 circumstances ^ithe Cambodian factions were unable to 

 reach a settlement. .

 P.6

 Last monthi several of us present here today met in 

 Geneva at the International Conference on Indochinese 

 Refugees. I reaffirmed then « as I do again today - 

 that Australia is committed to playing its part in 

 putting in place and making work the balanced package 

 of measures which was endorsed at that conference. 

 Australia does not underestimate the complexity of the 

 task of finding solutions to these long-standing 

 humanitarian problems. We have no illusions that 

 sufficient voluntary returns will occur over the next 

 few months to off-set the large numbers of boat people 

 that have recently arrived in the ASEAN region. But 

 without effective provisions for the return, under 

 conditions of safety and dignity, of persons deemed 

 not to be genuine refugees, it is difficult to see how 

 the Comprehensive Plan of Action, into which we have 

 all put so much effort, can succeed.

 One of the paradoxes confronting Governments is that 

 the increasing interdependence of nations, which is 

 generally recognised, is being undermined by self 

 centred trade policies. Countries that ought to know 

 better, and regions which have themselves come to

 prosperity through trsde, appear to be increasingly 

 â¢susceptible to the false promises of protectionism and 

 managed trade. It is crucial that this trend be 

 reversed and that ail countries work for an open 

 multilateral trading system which alone can deliver 

 the greatest good to the greatest number.

 The agreement achieved at the April Trade Negotiations 

 Committee Meeting saved the Uruguay Round from 

 collapse. But in aVl areas - agriculture no less than 

 minerals and energy productsf textiles, safeguards 

 services and other sectors - the really hard work is 

 still ahead of ua. The most difficult part of the 

 Round is yet to come and it will test the extent to 

 which the commitments already ·  given to further 

 liberalise world trade and reduce distortion can be 

 translated into actual results.  The clock is ticking 

 fast. Fewer than 18 months remain before the end of 

 the Round.

 We have a unique opportunity to shape the direction of 

 trade and economic policy efforts until the end of the 

 century. We must make the extra effort now while 

 there is still time, so that we can meet the goal of 

 achieving a worthwhile comprehensive outcome to the 

 Uruguay Round negotiations by the end of 1990.

 Opportunity also characterises the economic 

 environment of the Western Pacific Region.

 Over the last two decades the Western Pacific Region 

 has been an outstanding economic success with some of 

 the world's fastest growing economies.  The 

 performance of the ASEAN economies has been no less 

 remarkable,  with their share of world output doubling 

 between the early 1960» and 1986.

 19 17:30 FOREIGN AFFAIRS CANB 062 732081

 Economic growth in the Western Pacific Region haa been

 accompanied by a strong growth in interdependence and 

 intra regional links, not only in trade but also in 

 investment, tourism and increasing technology flows. 

 These processes together with continuing structural 

 change have helped assist in the successful spread of 

 industrialisation to ASEAN.

 While the growth prospects for the region for the next 

 decade and beyond remain good, there are a number of 

 uncertainties which could affect the region's 

 prospects. They; include :

 .  uncertainty over how long the current 

 expansion in the industrialised economies 

 (already the longest this century) will 

 continue;

 .  the persistence of non tariff barriers in the 

 world economy affecting, in particular, 

 products of interest to the Western Pacific 

 Region; ”

 .  the danger that structural problems within 

 the Western Pacific Region, particularly 

 large trade imbalances, might be resolved in 

 ways which restrict rather than expand 

 Pacific trade

 .  the possible future direction of regional 

 .  integration in the world economy and the need 

 to ensure that this occurs in a way that will 

 complement multilateral trade liberalisation.

 These uncertainties pose important challenges to the 

 region. In the face of a rapidly changing

 international environment, the region needs to be able 

 to project its interests more effectively in

 international economic form·· For example, we need to 

 ensure that the interests of dynamic Pacific economies 

 in an open multilateral trading system are reflected 

 in the outcome of the Uruguay Round and future rounds 

 of multilateral trade negotiations.

 Similarly there is a need to work towards the 

 resolution of any trading tensions in the region as 

 they arise through the process of consultation and 

 dialogue rather than^ by threats and retaliation.

 We believe that effective regional economic 

 coooperation can assist in pragmatic ways to sustain 

 the welcome momentum of economic growth in the Asia- 

 Pacific region,  as well as supporting the multilateral 

 trade system, and I look forward to an opportunity to 

 discuss this whole issue further later today.

 Let me conclude with these observations.  Our presence 

 here is a testament to the importance we ail attach to 

 the South East Asian region. For the dialogue 

 partners among us it is also a testament to the 

 priority we accord to our relations with ASEAN, that 

 "pillar of the region’s harmony and stability** as His 

 Majesty The Sultan of Brunei put it so well in his 

 Inaugural Address.

 One of the great strengths of ASEAN has been the vigor 

 with which it has pursued the cause of South East 

 Asian unity and co-operation. That vision of unity 

 has always been a broad one,  intended to embrace not 

 just the ASEAN states but also eventually the other 

 nations of South East Asia.

 Now,  for the first time since the foundation of ASEAN,  

 there is - with current developments in Indochina - 

 some prospect of that broader vision coming closer to

 reality. Australia welcomes the growing dialogue  

 between ASEAN and her other South East Asian 

 neighbours because we believe that it can only serve 

 to strengthen regional stability and enhance regional 

 commerce. We share the hope, recently articulated by 

 Prime Minister Mahathir, that we may indeed be moving 

 towards a South East Asia that is “economically 

 prosperous, strategically secure and politically at 

 one."
