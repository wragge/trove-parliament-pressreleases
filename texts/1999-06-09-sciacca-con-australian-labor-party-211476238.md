  OPPOSITION BLASTS IMMIGRATION MINISTER FOR 
BLATANT ATTEMPT TO POLITICISE KO  SOVO REFUGEES

  

  The Federal Opposition has expressed dismay at today’s announcement 
by the Government that seven Government MPs and Senators have been appointed 
as so called “Patrons” to the Kosovo Safe Havens.

  

  Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca h as attacked Immigration 
Minister Ruddock for what he described as a blatant attempt to politicise 
what to date has been a bi-partisan approach to Australia’s response 
to the Kosovo refugee crisis.

  

 “From the moment the Government decided to offer 
Australia as a safe haven to the 4,000 Kosovars, the Opposition has 
given strong bi-partisan support to the operation.

  

 “If the Minister felt there was a need to appoint 
Patrons for the safe havens, he should have discussed this matter with 
me, and with independent community leaders around the safe haven locations. 
People appointed as Patrons should represent all the community, not 
only those who voted for the Coalition.

  

 “This humanitarian operation belongs to the Australian 
people - not to the Government - and this blatant appointment of only 
Government members, when at least some of the areas are situated in 
Labor MPs electorates is disgraceful.

  

 “At the very least, if the Minister wanted Federal 
politicians to act as Patrons, he should have appointed them on a non-Party 
basis.

  

 “This Government is now turning the plight of the 
Kosovo refugees into yet another opportunity for ‘jobs for the boys 
and girls’,” Mr Sciacca said.
