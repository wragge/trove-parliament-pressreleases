 ANOTHER BOAT ARRIVAL, ANOTHER LABOR POLICY FAILURE 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The illegal arrival of yet another boat carrying 53 people demonstrates Labor’s failure to send a strong message 

 to people smugglers, putting people’s lives at risk and compromising the integrity and fairness of our refugee 

 programme, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 “Since Labor started fiddling with the thermostat on border protection we have had a people smugglers armada. 

 61 boats have arrived since August 2008 with 2677 desperate people putting their lives at risk. This is an 

 unacceptable outcome,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “The Rudd Labor Government’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge the consequences of their own words, policies 

 and responses means that the only way we can send a clear message to people smugglers is to elect a Coalition 

 Government,” he said.  

 “Since August 2008 we have witnessed a rapid escalation in the enormous risks to people’s lives by smugglers 

 wanting to make a quick buck out of human misery.  

 “This is a direct result of the Prime Minister deliberately softening the Howard Government’s successful border 

 controls. It wasn’t broken, it didn’t need to be fixed.  

 “Mr Rudd must take personal responsibility and fix what he has deliberately fouled.  

 “It is imperative that Labor accept there are “pull factors” of their own making which are drawing continued people 

 smuggling activity, destination Australia.  

 “This will continue while ever the Prime Minister remains in a state of denial over the outcomes of his own actions 

 in tinkering with previously successful border protection measures set down by the Howard Government.  

 “Australians will judge Mr Rudd on what he does, not what he says. He cannot spin these boats or the people 

 smugglers away,” Mr Morrison said.
