 SUBJECT / S: Abbott Government’s $80 billion cut to health and  education; Closure of Medicare Locals; Settlement of refugees    

 TANYA PLIBERSEK, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Good afternoon,  I am here in Adelaide today with my colleague, Kate Ellis, talking about recent  budget cuts to health and education and how they will affect the people of South  Australia.   We heard last Tuesday that the Federal Government will cut $5.5 billion of funding  to health and education over the next decade right here in South Australia. That has  a very dramatic effect on both the health system here and the education system.  This morning I was with Amanda Rishworth at one of the Medicare Locals here in  South Australia and the staff at the Medicare Local was telling me what it means to  them to be told their being wound up. It means that a whole lot of services being  provided by the Medicare Local will be lost to the community. Headspace, Partners  in Recovery, all of the programs that have been making a huge difference in primary  healthcare, mental healthcare, GP hours and afterhours and indeed this particular  Medicare Local had seen immunisation rates in the community that they are  responsible for increase dramatically because of the steps that they have taken  around immunisation, so all of those primary healthcare services were lost. Then we  hear on top of that, these Budget cuts mean hospital beds closing in South Australia.  Hundreds of hospital beds will close in South Australia, the equivalent of the Flinders 

 Medical Centre taken out of the South Australian health system because of Federal  Government cuts to the health system.   Now this afternoon here with Kate we have been touring this fantastic, marvellous  school hearing about the great work that is done here. South Australians will  remember that Christopher Pyne said before the election “You can vote Liberal or  you can vote Labor, your school will get exactly the same funding.” Well that  promise has been broken, that promise to South Australian school children has been  broken. And it was broken knowingly and deliberately.   We know that without Gonski School Funding, schools like this will miss out on the  substantial growth that in the future for these schools. That means that these kids  will miss out on a quality education. It is an extraordinary argument from the  Federal Government that if you just cut funding to the states in health and education  they will somehow become more efficient, somehow services will improve if you cut  $80 billion out of hospitals and school funding. It is the most ridiculous, dishonest  claim from the Federal Government. The worst thing about these health and  education cuts is how they will affect patients in the health system and students in  the education system. But the other shockingly bad thing about these cuts is the fact  that they were knowingly and deliberately lied about before the election. Tony  Abbott said, more than once, he said many, many times before the election no cuts  to health, no cuts to education, no change to pensions, no new taxes. He said it  voluntarily, no one was holding a gun to his head, and he has broken every one of  those commitments.   The no new taxes commitment; he has hit people with a GP tax, an increase co-payment for Medicines, an increase in petrol tax and an increase in income tax at  the same time. He keeps breaking the no new taxes, no increase taxes promise and  it comes on top of severe cuts to the services that South Australians depend on.  Cuts to their hospitals which will see hospital beds close, itâll see patients waiting  longer for emergency treatments, see patients waiting longer for elective surgery  and cuts to the education system, that will see kids like these missing out. It will see  South Australians missing out on technical education, vocational education and see  South Australian young people paying much, much more for a university education.  Iâll hand over to Kate.    

 KATE ELLIS, SHADOW MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, MEMBER FOR  ADELAIDE: Well thank you. It is fantastic to have our Deputy Leader, Tanya  Plibersek, here in Adelaide today talking about these cuts. Now in South Australia,  when people went to the polls last year they were faced with large posters at polling  booths saying âwe will match Laborâs school funding dollar for dollar.â With $30 billion  cut from school funding, that has been shown to be a lie. But what we want to  outline today is the impacts that this lie will have and these huge cuts to our schools  will have on the education that students are receiving here in South Australia right  now.   Now this morning we heard that the lies havenât stopped. Christopher Pyne on South  Australian radio today said “This budget doesnât contain any education cuts.” That is  clearly not true and his own budget papers make that very clear. But the Liberals are  also telling the Australian public that any cuts are so far in the future that they are  not having an impact until after the next election. This is yet another lie. We need to  be very clear that when you flag the biggest cut to schools in this countryâs history, 

 the impacts of that start to be felt straight away. As Premiers, including Liberal  Premiers, right around Australia have made clear, they need to look at programs  which will be shut, they need to look at special supports that will not be offered,  support for students with a disability, support for students with special needs,  supports for students who need extension classes to make sure that they reach their  full capacity.   Now anyone who runs any sort of budget knows that if you know there is a very big  cut coming in just a few yearsâ time, you have to start making preparations for that.  This is why it is so important that Tony Abbot reverses these cuts as the Premiers  are calling on him to do. We want to make sure that we are all working to improve  our schools, not to rip finances, rip programs, and rip teachers and support officers  out of our schools. Cuts which will be starting in the very near future and if Tony  Abbott and Christopher Pyne donât want to take Laborâs words for that, they should  listen to the words of their own Liberal Premiers who are telling them over and over  again. The Labor Party knows, the Australian public knows, principles know,  teachers know, Liberal Premiers know that these are real cuts and they are real cuts  which will start having an impact immediately. They need to be reversed.   PLIBERSEK: Thanks. Might ask questions of Kate first, and then if youâve got any  questions of me you can ask them when youâre done with Kate.    JOURNALIST: Well in South Australia there are some others cuts which will be  coming in from the first of July, so can you talk a bit more about the immediate  effects of the Budget cuts?   ELLIS: We will see a range of different effects on South Australianâs lives  immediately. We know for example that those pensioners who are now facing the  prospect of changes to their pension will start to feel the impact from concessions  which are being ripped away, which will increase their cost of living. We know that  there are changes to the health budget which will have immediate impacts in terms  of shutting down beds, and in terms of closing Medicare Locals, another promise  which was made to the Australian public. We know that in a range of areas the cuts  that this Government are proposing will come into effect straight away, and least of  all we also know that when it comes to higher education South Australian uni  students have every right to be upset, that a government who said they would not  increase fees will start slugging students with the highest fees this country has ever  seen. This will no doubt have an impact on South Australians and their decisions on  higher education. These are just some of the very real impacts which will be felt  from this Budget now.     Tony Abbott, Joe Hockley, and locally Christopher Pyne, cannot tell the Australian  public on the one hand we have made a range of cuts but on the other hand this will  not have a very severe and immediate impact on your life because that is just  another lie and South Australians will see the truth all too soon.   JOURNALIST: But if the cuts go ahead isnât it the state government, it will be up to  them, before hospitals close and schools close, to find some kind of cash stream to  make up for the short fall?   ELLIS: Well I did see Christopher Pyne try to answer the question of where State  Governments would find $80 billion for our schools and hospitals. Now letâs also be  very clear that when it comes to school funding this Government havenât just  announced the biggest cut in Australiaâs history, they have also said that, unlike the  Gonski agreement, they have given a green light to State Premiers right around the 

 country to start cutting school funding immediately. This is actually, it is not true  that the Federal Government can just wash their hands of decisions that the State  Governments make because it is within their power to prevent these cuts, and it is  within their power to look at other options, other than attacking our schools and  hospitals. We know that there are a number of areas where this Government is quite  prepared to shell out large amounts of funding. It is just a sign of their wrong  priorities, that those areas are not schools and hospitals, which are first on the  chopping block.   JOURNALIST: Can Federal Labor afford to reinstate the $80 billion?   PLIBERSEK: Well we are not going to start speculating about what would be in a  re-elected Labor governmentâs first budget. What we can say is this is a clear broken  promise. Tony Abbott could not have said more often there will be no cuts to health  and no cuts to education. And in their very first Budget, in their own glossy Budget  documentation, in the pamphlet that they are handing out to boast about their  Budget they have got an $80 billion cut in that pamphlet. It is extraordinary to first  of all say you wonât cut, then make a cut of this size, and then walk around  afterwards saying that there is no cut you are all imagining it. It is extraordinary that  Tony Abbott would think anyone would believe anything that he says from now on.  These are some of the largest cut we have ever seen to, well these are the largest  cut we have ever seen, to hospitals or schools and they have come despite Tony  Abbottâs promise not to cut health and not to cut education.   JOURNALIST: Well theyâd argue that if itâs not in the forwards estimates then itâs  not really locked in. Is that a fair argument?   PLIBERSEK: Well, no, itâs a convenient argument because we make plenty of  commitments that go beyond the forward estimates. Labor has found many savings  when we were in Government that go well beyond the forward estimates. When I  was Health Minister for example, we means-tested private health insurance, that  was opposed tooth and nail by Tony Abbott and by the Liberals and they fought us  every step of the way. Not only have they taken that saving now, and of course they  will continue it, but they have actually expanded the saving, they have actually  frozen some of the income levels so that more people will be hit by this means-testing than when Labor was in Government. So you see that there are responsible  ways of making long term savings. We pay less today for generic medicines than we  ever have because of responsible long term savings that Labor took when we were  in Government, again opposed by the Liberals. We proposed tax changes that would  stop international companies structuring themselves so that they could avoid  corporate tax in Australia, again opposed by the Liberals. Labor has proposed many  sensible saving measures that the Liberals have fought tooth and nail against. They  have also introduced their own spending measures that show their wrong priorities.  A $5.5 billion a year paid parental leave scheme at the same time as the Liberals are  trying to convince Australians that we all need to tighten our belts, just doesnât ring  true. A $9 billion grant to the Reserve Bank at a time when the Liberals are telling  people we just need to tighten our belts, again just doesnât pass the sniff test.   JOURNALIST: Isnât the GST a possible solution that should at least be discussed?   PLIBERSEK: Well look I think thatâs something for the State Premiers and Joe  Hockey and Tony Abbott should explain to Australians. Why is it that Tony Abbott  and Joe Hockey went to the election promising no change to the GST, no change to  its rate, no change to its coverage and now they have backed the State Premiers 

 and Treasurers into a situation where they think that the States will make the  unpopular decision to argue for a lift in the GST? But there are two things here -  there is the broken promise on health and education cuts and then there is the  broken promise on tax increases. Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott canât get out of  taking responsibility for both of those things. There is absolutely no need to increase  the rate of the GST if the crazy spending priorities like paid parental leave are set  aside. If Tony Abbott could let go of paying millionaires $50,000 to have a baby then  I donât think we would be talking about GST increases right now.   JOURNALIST: Tanya, will you be supporting the resettlement of refugees from  Nauru to Cambodia?   PLIBERSEK: Well look we havenât seen any of the details of this proposal yet but I  have a number of concerns. Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in Asia.  Cambodia continues to have problems feeding its own people,  malnourishment is  still a problem in Cambodia. It is a post conflict country that has some significant  challenges day to day.  And I would like to hear from Tony Abbott, from Scott  Morrison, Joe Hockey, those people who blocked the arrangement that Labor came  to with Malaysia, why Cambodia is a better place for refugees or asylum seekers to  be sent to than Malaysia where people could work, live in the community, their  children could go to school and they could access health services?
