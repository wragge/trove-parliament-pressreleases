 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 SPEECH TO CEDA

 Extracts from the speech "Building a Nation" presented-  by   Mr Alan C a d m a n , Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic   Aff a i r s , to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia   (CEDA), W e d n e s d a y , 11 June 1986 (Boulevard H o t e l , Sydney).

 "The Coalition has been arguing for some time that an increase in   the general level of migration is most desirable. We have argued   that such an increase should be based upon attracting migrants   who are y o u n g , employable, educated and with skills as well as  

 attracting those who will invest in the cou n t r y . ,

 "The Government's newly announced program for the coming year   finds general agreement with the Opposition's policy. There is   to be an expansion' over the next two years of about 10,000. Some   of the additional migrants will have an economic advantage for   Australia. ,  .

 "This is a welcome change and it will begin a restoration of a   balance that has been missing for three years. The Government   has argued its case for increased immigration on a 1  populate or   p e r i s h 1  basis. We, on the other hand, believe the most  

 compelling reasons are economic.

 "Unfortunately, I do not believe the Government will be able to   sustain its expanded program against its critics from the Left   Wing of the ALP and the union m o v e m e n t . As the real extent of   Australia's mismanaged circumstances of a deficit-funded economy  

 impact more heavily on the workforce, 'populate or pe r i s h '  will   have little m e a n i n g . Preserving the average age of our   workforce, 15 or 20 years hence, carries little persuasion   against the immediate claims of militant union leaders or the  

 spendthrift policies of the Left. Expanded migration will not   solve the national economic crisis and the proposition of a   migration-led recovery is unrealistic. How e v e r , a balanced   substantial program will assist in recovery.

 2

 "Alongside the social and cultural contribution, migration has   brought entrepreneurship, a small business ethos and   technological innovation. The economic benefits of our post-war   migration program have included the expansion of the domestic   market, a more rapid rise in overall gross domestic product than   would otherwise have been achieved, an increase in the labour  

 force, the ability to be able to cope with our 'skills gap'  and   generally the recruitment of a population in its productive   years. .

 "Increases in migration demand balanced program,·balance is the.   most important criteria for migration planning.

 "It would be unrealistic to fail to acknowledge that we, in the   Opposition, do not have a commitment to the reunion of families   or to the compassionate side of immigration. They have   contributed much to our nation.

 "Migrants have helped build the nation. Underlying are the   shared values that bind us together - the liberty and freedom of   the individual, access to the opportunity to succeed, and strong   family attitudes.

 "Whilst I have argued that increased migration is economically   beneficial, provided that the balance of the migration 'mix1  is   weighted .towards migrants who are economically positive, we would   be more than unfair to our population and to those newcomers who   we would want to so warmly welcome, unless we could ensure that   we can economically afford new migrants and, just as importantly,  

 that they would have a sound economic future in their newly   chosen home."

 BUILDING A NATION

 AUSTRALIA HAS DEPENDED UPON MIGRATION TO INCREASE POPULATION, TO 

 PROVIDE LABOUR. TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TO PROVIDE A BASIS  FOR SELF-DEFENCE.

 THE NATION HAS -&J3BR BEEN ENHANCED BY THE TREMENDOUS INFLUX OF 

 INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH A CAPACITY FOR HARD-WORK. AND ENDEAVOUR  AND A COMMITMENT TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLES WHICH UNDERPIN OUR SOCIETY.

 IN PUTTING MIGRATION UNDER THE ECONOMIC MICROSCOPE WE SHOULD NEVER 

 LOSE SIGHT OF THE HUMAN FACTORS. HUMAN FACTORS NEED TO BE ACKNOWLEDGE 

 AS THESE ELEMENTS CANNOT BE REDUCED TO STATISTICAL TERMS.

 MIGRANTS HAVE HELPED (g BUILD THE NATION. UNDERLYING ARE THE SHARED 

 VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER - THE LIBERTY AND FREEDOM OF THE 

 INDIVIDUAL. ACCESS TO THE OPPORTUNITY: TO SUCCEED, AND STRONG FAMILY  ATTITUDES. ’

 ECONOMIC MIGRANTS. REFUGEES. DISPLACED PERSONS AND FAMILY REUNION  MIGRANTS - ALL LOOK FOR MUCH THE SAME: THINGS IN OUR SOCIETY.

 THE FIRST SETTLERS WANTED LIBERTY AND, OPPORTUNITY AND OUR PEOPLE 

 HAVE BEEN STRIVING FOR THESE GOALS SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR NATIONAL  FOUNDATION - ALMOST 200 YEARS AGO. THESE VALUES ARE THE CORE OF OUR 

 NATION - FREEDOM, ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY AND FAMILY. ·  '

 SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR, IMMIGRATION LEVELS HAVE FLUCTUATED. 

 DEPENDING UPON THE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA.

 THE IMPACT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS FOR IMMIGRATION, OFFER GUIDANCE 

 FOR POLICY INITIATIVES. ASSESSMENT WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE MACRO­ ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE REQUIRE SUBSTANTIVE RESEARCH. IN THIS REGARD,

 DR. NEVILLE NORMAN AND KATHRYN MEIKLE ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED ON 

 THEIR OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF THE ECONOMICS OF 

 IMMIGRATION. ;

 THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND POPULATION GROWTH IS CLEARLY 

 DISPLAYED IN THE TWO HISTORICAL PERIODS OF SUSTAINED UP-SWING ECONOMIC 

 GROWTH, BEING 1861-1891 AND 1945-1970. |  THE TWO PERIODS ALSO DISPLAY 

 A STRONG MIGRATION INPUT. j  !

 A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS CAN ALSO BE HIGHLIGHTED IN RELATION TO

 ECONOMIC GROWTH. ALONGSIDE THE SOCIAL ! AND CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION, â¢ . . . i â  MIGRATION HAS BROUGHT ENTREPRENEURSHIP.! A SMALL BUSINESS ETHOS 

 AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF OUR POST-WAR  MIGRATION PROGRAMME HAVE INCLUDED THE EXPANSION OF THE DOMESTIC MARKET.  A MORE RAPID RISE IN.OVERALL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT THAN WOULD 

 OTHERWISE BEEN ACHIEVED. AN INCREASE IN THE LABOUR FORCE, THE 

 ABILITY TO BE ABLE,TO COPE WITH OUR "SKILLS GAP" AND GENERALLY THE .  . 1  .  · RECRUITMENT OF A POPULATION |N ITS PRODUCTIVE YEARS.

 .  .  Î¯ â   - â   '

 MIGRANTS CREATE DEMAND EFFECTS IN THE ECONOMY THROUGH PERSONAL  EXPENDITURE AND THROUGH INCREASED GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE FOR SCHOOLS. 

 HEALTH SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES. SUBSEQUENTLY,, ADDITIONAL INVESTMEN 

 FOLLOWS AS RESIDENTS. BUSINESSES. GOVERNMENTS AND FOREIGN INVESTORS  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ADDITIONAL DEMAND AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

 IMMEDIATELY ON ARRIVAL THERE IS AN OUTLAY OF FUNDS BY THE NEW MIGRANT.  IN 1983-84 THE AVERAGE MIGRANT BROUGHT $32.000 WITH THEM TO AUSTRALIA. 

 THIS REPRESENTED $777 MILLION DOLLARS. ;  IN ADDITION. THE BALANCE OF 

 MIGRANT PRIVATE TRANSFER PAYMENTS IN TRAT YEAR WAS A NET GAIN OF  $406 MILLION. THE FURTHER INCOME FROMjWAGES AND SALARIES THEN 

 CREATED ADDITIONAL SPENDING. j

 â   .  .  â   .  i  â 

 GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT MUST BE ,DIRECTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH DEMAND, BALANCED AGAINST THE SUPPLY OF ADDITIONAL LABOUR 

 AND OPULATION. IN ESSENCE. MIGRATION CLAUSES THE POTENTIAL GROWTH 

 IN BOTH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF GOODS AND SERVICES.

 4

 EVIDENCE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PROPOSITION THAT ADDITIONAL 

 POPULATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN AUSTRALIA'S FOREMOST REQUIREMENT FOR GROWTH 

 FURTHERMORE. THERE ARE STRONG INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POPULATION  GROWTH. CAPITAL FORMATION AND CAPITAL INFLOW.

 UP TO 1860 THE GROWTH OF POPULATION WAS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON .  

 MIGRATION WHICH CONTRIBUTED ABOUT 75% OF THE TOTAL INCREASE. BETWEEN 

 1860 AND 1890 ABOUT 25% OF THE POPULATION'S INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE  TO MIGRATION. -

 IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE LEVEL OF ANNUAL MIGRATION HAS GENERALLY 

 BEEN LESS THAN 1% OF THE POPULATION.  IN THE 1920"S AVERAGE ANNUAL  MIGRATION WAS ABOUT 25,000 PEOPLE OR 0.46%. THE TOST WORLD WAR TWO 

 TARGET OF U  PER ANNUM WAS ACHIEVED BETWEEN 1949 AND 1952 AND IN 1955.

 AS DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN 1949 AND 1970, .  

 MIGRATION TARGETS FLUCTUATED ACCORDINGLY. SINCE 1970, ON AVERAGE, 

 THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP DECLINE IN MIGRATION LEVELS. IN 1985  MIGRATION REPRESENTED ABOUT 0.5% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. HOWEVER.

 IT SHOULD BE RECOGNISED THAT THE 1979 TO 1983 PERIOD OF THE  FRASER ADMINISTRATION DISPLAYED AN INCREASE IN MIGRATION LEVELS -

 BETWEEN 1947 AND 1981 MIGRANTS AND THEIR CHILDREN CREATEDfl^OUT 

 3/5THS OF THE NATIONAL POPULATION GROWTH. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT 

 IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY MAKING AT A TIME WHEN EMPLOYMENT IN PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY INDUSTRY IS FALLING AND WHEN EMPLOYMENT GENERALLY IS BAS

 5

 MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIALLY ON HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS AND SPECIALIST  SKILLS THAN IT WAS IN THE 1960’S.

 WHAT OF THE MIGRANTS THEMSELVES ?

 A NUMBER OF MISCONCEPTIONS ARE COMMONLY HELD ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND 

 THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MIGRANTS ON OUR SOCIETY. IT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED  THAT OUR MIGRATION-PROGRAMME HAS BASICALLY BROUGHT UNSKILLED LABOUR.  THAT IMMIGRATION COSTS AUSTRALIANS JOBS, AND THAT ALL MIGRATION LEADS  TO A DRAIN ON GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE. THAT STATEMENT NEEDS FURTHER 

 EXAMINATION. HOWEVER. THERE IS SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE  WHICH CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES IMMIGRATION TO BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO  AUSTRALIA. .

 IMMIGRANTS HAVE NOT BEEN BASICALLY UNSKILLED ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN :  

 A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF MIGRANTS GO INTO PROCESS WORK AND INTO 

 MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES. IT IS AN UNTRUE GENERALISATION'TO CONTEND  THAT^ Ml GRANTS WERE UNSKILLED FACTORY FODDER. MANY HAVE BEEN BUT MANY  aS^NOT. IMMIGRATION CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN SOX OF THE INCREASE IN THE  

 OVERALL WORKFORCE SINCE 1947 AND CERTAINLY IN REFERENCE TO PARTICULAR  

 AREAS OF INDUSTRY SUCH AS MANUFACTURING, THE INCREASE IN THE WORKFORCE   LEVEL IS DRAMATIC. FOR EXAMPLE, BETWEEN 1961 AND 1966, THE INCREASE  

 IN THE MANUFACTURING WORKFORCE FROM MIGRATION WAS OVER 122X.

 IMMIGRATION EVEN IN THE PERIOD BEFORE THE 1973 ECONOMIC VIABILITY 

 TEST, PRODUCED LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN THE PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATIONAL 

 LABOUR FORCE. FOR EXAMPLE. THE 1966 CENSUS INFORMS US THAT OF ALL

 ENGINEERS, 31% WERE MIGRANTS. OF GEOLOGISTS AND GEOPHYSICISTS,

 47.3% WERE MIGRANTS AND OF UNIVERSITY LECTURERS AMD TEACHERS. 40.1% WERE MIGRANTS.

 IN ADDING TO THE INCOME CAPACITY OF THE COMMUNITY, SECOND-GENERATION 

 MIGRATION GROUPS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER INCOMES THAN MANY NATIVE-BORN  AUSTRALIANS.

 A RECENT STUDY BY NINA MISTI LIS OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.  CONCLUDED THAT IN ALMOST ALL OF THE SECOND-GENERATION GROUPS STUDIED. 

 AUSTRALIANS WHOSE FATHERS WERE BORN IN BRITAIN. IRELAND, NEW ZEALAND. 

 GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS. POLAND. GREECE AND ITALY, HAD A HIGHER INCOME 

 THAN OTHER NATIVE-BORN AUSTRALIANS. THUS. IN ECONOMIC TERMS.

 THE MIGRATION OF THEIR PARENTS WAS SUCCESSFUL. SHE ALSO CONCLUDED.

 AND I  QUOTE: /

 "THE FAVOURABLE ECONOMIC LOCATION OF THE SECOND GENERATION 

 MAY INDICATE THE DEGREE OF THE.IR ADJUSTMENT TO THE  LABOUR MARKET AND THE CONVERSE. IF THIS IS SO. THEN  IT PROVIDES OPTIMISM IN AUSTRALIA IN TERMS OF THE SOCIAL  IMPLICATIONS OF LARGE-SCALE MIGRATION.* '

 THESE CONCLUSION ARE ALSO CONFIRMED BY PAUL MILLER' STUDY FOR AIMA.

 7

 I  QUOTE:

 "GROSS INCOME DATA FROM THE 1981 CENSUS INDICATE THAT 

 EMPLOYED OVERSEAS BORN 16 TO 24 YEAR OLDS FARE REASONABLY  WELL IN THE LABOUR MARKET. HAVING. ON AVERAGE, EARNINGS 

 4.5% HIGHER THAN AUSTRALIAN 16 TO 24 YEARO.DS."

 THERE STILL REMAINS A DOWN SIDE IN PUBLIC PERCEPTION AND THEY TEND 

 TO SAY "OH, THAT’S VERY GOOD. BUT WHAT ABOUT JOBS FOR AUSTRALIANS  AND WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT COSTS." LET US LOOK AT THAT.

 THE ANSWER REALLY DEPENDS UPON DOMEST1C. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN  AUSTRALIA AT ANY. POINT IN TIME. ULTIMATELY THE BENEFIT DEPENDS UPON 

 WHETHER IMMIGRATION CREATES MORE DEMAND FOR LABOUR THAN THE SUPPLY  OF LABOUR.

 IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT ALL IMMIGRATION WILL, IN THE LONG RUN, CREATE  MORE JOBS THAN THE LABOUR IT SUPPLIES. THE REASONS ARE — r THE 

 SPENDING BASE OF MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVE . THE SPENDING HABITS OF AFTER 

 ARRIVAL MIGRANTS .  THE CREATION OF PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT THROUGH 

 INDUCED EXPENDITURE FROM MIGRANT FAMILIES .  PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYMENT  BASED UPON RELATIVE INCREASES IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AND THE 

 PROVISION OF SOCIAL INFRA-STRUCTURE.

 THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE TO BE BALANCED AGAINST THE COST OF A POOL OF 

 UNSKILLED LABOUR WHICH MAY DEVELOP TO A LEVEL ABOVE THE CAP A C H Y  

 FOR INDUSTRY AND THE COMMUNITY TO ABSORB IT.

 8

 THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT PREDOMINANTLY ÎÎÎ-SKILLED MIGRATION  WILL CROWD OUT EXISTING NON-SKILLED MARKETS IF THE BALANCE OF THE  PROGRAMME IS NOT CORRECT. ALTHOUGH THE LONGER TERM BENEFITS OF 

 MIGRATION ARE EVIDENT. THE BALANCE OF UNSKILLED TO SKILLED PEOPLE WILL  AVERT MOST OF SHORT-TERM DOWN-SIDE EFFECTS.

 N. W. FISHER STATES THAT AROUND 44% OF MIGRANTS ENTER THE LABOUR 

 FORCE AND THEREBY ADD TO LABOUR SUPPLY. IF, FISHER ARGUES, THERE WAS  NO INCREASE ON THE DEMAND SIDE. THEN UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD RISE. HOWEVER. 

 IMMIGRATION DOES ADD TO THE DEMAND FOR LABOUR BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED 

 DEMAND FOR GOODS AND SERVICES FROM THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS.

 ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE TO SUGGEST THAT IMMIGRATION HAS EXPANDED 

 AT A TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY HAS USUALLY BEEN BOUYANT, IT WOULD  APPEAR AS D. W. STAMMER OBSERVED IN "IMMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY",

 THAT THAT THE YEARS OF INCREASED IMMIGRATION HAVE NOT BEEN YEARS OF 

 !  INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT."

 JOHN PERKINS' STUDY "IMMIGRATION AND THE DEMAND FOR CONSUMER GOODS 

 AND HOUSING", DEDUCED THAT THERE WAS "A SYSTEMATIC TENDENCY OF IMMIGRAT  TO RAISE THE DEMAND FOR CONSUMER GOODS BY A GREATER PERCENTAGE THAN 

 THE ADDITION TO POPULATION". THIS WAS PARTICULARLY NOTED IN THOSE  CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE WHICH RELATED TO HOUSING, DOMESTIC 

 HOUSEHOLD AND DURABLE CONSUMER GOODS.

 SUCH IS THE CASE IN THE IMMEDIATE 5-YEAR PERIOD AFTER ARRIVAL.

 9

 IT WAS NOTED BY THE ECONOMIC RESEARCH UNIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 

 IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND  ABOUT 10.5% MORE DWELLINGS CONSTRUCTED DURING THE MID-1970'S, HAD IMMIGRATION BEEN MAINTAINED INSTEAD OF REDUCED.

 WHAT ABOUT THE COST OF IMMIGRATION TO OUR TAXPAYERS ?

 INCREASES IN OUR MIGRATION PROGRAMME BRING ADDITIONAL COSTS.

 IN SUPPLYING SOCIAL INFRA-STRUCTURE AND SERVICES, WELFARE. EDUCATION 

 AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE GALBALLY PROGRAMME WAS THE PREVIOUS 

 GOVERNMENTS SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO SHORT-CIRCUIT THIS PROCESS.

 IN THE STUDY OF SIMULATIONS UNDERTAKEN BY DR. NORMAN AND KATHRYN 

 MEIKLE, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT EDUCATION EXPENDITURE IN TOTAL. IN 

 PER CAPITA TERMS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WOULD 

 RISE AS THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE POPULATION, THROUGH MIGRATION, FELL.

 SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE PAYMENTS WOULD INCREASE IN TOTAL.

 ALTHOUGH THE PER CAPITA EXPENDITURE AND ITS REPRESENTATION AS A 

 PERCENTAGE OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WOULD. IN FACT, FALL. THE 

 SAME WOULD BE TRUE FOR HEALTH EXPENDITURE - THAT IS. AS THE AVERAGE  AGE OF THE POPULATION COMES DOWN AND THE NUMBER OF TAXPAYING EMPLOYED 

 INDIVIDUALS RISES. ,

 10

 NONETHELESS, SUCH ASSUMPTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ARE  PREDICTED UPON THE BASIS THAT THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT INFUSION 

 OF UNSKILLED NOR UNEMPLOYABLE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT THE AGE MEDIAN  OF THE INTAKE IS PREDOMINATELY YOUNG AND ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT.

 THE COALITION HAS BEEN ARGUING FOR SOME TIME THAT AN INCREASE IN 

 THE GENERAL LEVEL OF MIGRATION IS MOST DESIRABLE. WE HAVE ARGUED 

 THAT SUCH AN INCREASE SHOULD BE BASED UPON ATTRACTING MIGRANTS 

 WHO ARE YOUNG. EMPLOYABLE, EDUCATED AND WITH SKILLS AS WELL AS  ATTRACTING THOSE WHO WILL INVEST IN THE COUNTRY.

 THE COST TO TAXPAYERS. OF ANY EXPANDED IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME.

 IS STRONGLY LINKED TO THE POTENTIAL OF MIGRANTS AND THEIR “ON ARRIVAL*  ABILITIES.

 LET ME SUMMARISE SOME CONCLUSIONS WE CAN SAFELY REAC hT ^ Y  .

 DESPITE THE WORK OF CEDA AND THE CONTINUING INTEREST IN T Ht AREA 

 OF THE EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION AND EMPLOYMENT AT AN ACADEMIC LEVEL, 

 THE LEVEL OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH TENDS TO BE/EMPIRICALLY  INCONCLUSIVE. HOWEVER, SOME PROPOSITIONS ARE APPARENT.« FIRSTLY. 

 THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICY. DOMESTIC  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA AND THE LEVEL OF ENCOURAGED AND 

 ACHIEVED MIGRATION.

 SECONDLY, LABOUR MARKET BENEFITS FROM MIGRATION ARE REDUCED

 UNLESS GOVERNMENT FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY TAKE SUFFICIENT

 ACCOUNT OF CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF MIGRATION, TO ACCOMMODATE INVESTMEN

 11

 THIRDLY. IN THE LONGER TERM IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT INCREASED  MIGRATION INCREASES THE LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT.

 FOURTHLY, ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION UPON PER CAPITA  INCOME TEND TO IMPLY A GROWTH OF INCOMES. SUCH AN EFFECT IS 

 BOTH POSITIVE AND SLIGHT. -  '

 FINALLY, IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT IMMIGRATION ASSISTS THE ELEMENTS 

 OF THE ECONOMY TO COPE WITH STRUCTURAL CHANGE. THEREBY ENHANCING  THE ABILITY OF OUR COUNTRY TO GENERATE SUSTAINED EMPLOYMENT GROWTH.

 DESPITE THE DESIRABILITY OF AN EXPANDED I  MMIGRATI ON PROGRAMME.  

 AUSTRALIA'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT MIGRANTS WHO WILL CONTRIBUTE WILL  DEPEND UPON THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY AND THE INTERNATIONAL PERCEPTION 

 OF OUR ECONOMIC POSITION.

 OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POSITION IS GOING TO PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL 

 ROLE IN OUR FUTURE IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME. '

 THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS, THE ALARMING INCREASE IN OUR.OVERSEAS 

 INDEBTEDNESS. A HIGH-INFLATION RATE AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES OF 

 CAPITAL GAINS TAXES AND FRINGE BENEFITS TAXES WILL MAKE AN INCREASE 

 IN IMMIGRATION DIFFICULT.

 IT IS NO USE IGNORING THE PORTENTS OF ECONOMIC GLOOM WHICH ARE  PRESENT TODAY. INVESTMENT LEVELS ARE DECLINING. THE INTERNATIONAL 

 ASSESSMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY WILL ALSO AFFECT THE QUALITY 

 AND RANGE OF MIGRANTS WISHING TO COME TO AUSTRALIA. THAT ASSESSMENT  OF OUR ECONOMY CAN BE GAUGED IN THE DRAMATIC DEVALUATION OF THE DOLLAR

 12

 I  QUOTE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN OF JUNE 6, 1986 REPORTING ON 

 STATEMENTS. IN THE INFLUENTIAL LONDON NEWSPAPER, THE FINANCIAL TIMES

 "THE PAPER LIKENED THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO A SURFER "POISED  OVER A GIANT CURLING WAVE". IT WARNED THAT AUSTRALIA WOULD  EITHER GRACEFULLY RIDE OUT THE PRESENT FOAMING CRISIS OR IT 

 WILL BE OVERWHELMED AND. LIKE THE SURFER. CRASH AND WIPE OUT.  THERE IS NO MIDDLE WAY."

 WHILE INTEREST RATES FOR INVESTMENT AND HOUSING REMAIN AT HIGH 

 LEVELS AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING FALLS IT BECOMES EVEN MORE 

 DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT MIGRANTS FROM SOUND ECONOMIES TO AUSTRALIA.

 THE NECESSITY FOR ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL MIGRATION IN A  DEPRESSED ECONOMY IS OBVIOUS. HOWEVER. THE PRESENT MIGRATION 

 PROGRAMME IS NOT ACHIEVING A LARGE COMPONENT OF SUCH PEOPLE.  .

 THE SKILLED AND BUSINESS MIGRATION PROGRAMME AND EMPLOYER 

 NOMINATION SCHEMES ARE POSITIVE AND ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AN  ECONOMICALLY RATIONAL IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME. IN 1984-85, THE  GOVERNMENT SET A TARGET OF 4,000 BUSINESS MIGRANTS. BUT MANAGED  TO ACHIEVE ONLY 1,417. THE TARGET FOR THE PRESENT YEAR WAS 

 RAISED TO 4,500 BUT THE ACTUAL EXPECTED RESULT WILL PROBABLY NOT 

 BE MUCH MORE THAN 1,500. THE FAILURE TO ACHIEVE TARGET LEVELS  WAS NOT JUST BROUGHT ABOUT JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UNWILLING TO 

 COME TO AUSTRALIA !

 13

 I  QUOTE FROM THE "AGE" OF 15 APRIL 1986;

 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF 

 MANUFACTURERS. MR BRIAN POWELL. SAID THAT BUREAUCRATIC 

 DELAYS OF 8-12 MONTHS WERE FRUSTRATING PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS  MIGRANTS.' IT WAS NOT THE POLICY BUT THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSING 

 OF APPLICANTS THAT WAS CAUSING PROBLEMS.

 FURTHER TO THIS, THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE VICTORIAN EMPLOYERS'  FEDERATION, MR IAN SPICER SAID:

 THAT AUSTRALIA HAD FAILED TO ATTRACT THE FULL QUOTA 

 OF BUSINESS MIGRANTS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ACTIVE RECRUITMENT 

 AND PROMOTION OVERSEAS. DELAYS IN PROCESSING AND CLEARING 

 APPLICATIONS HAVE LED MANY APPLICANTS TO CHANGE THEIR INDS 

 ABOUT COMING TO AUSTRALIA. MANY HAVE GONE TO OTHER COUNTRIES / 

 WHICH COMPETE WITH US TO ATTRACT SKILLED MIGRANTS.

 THE GOVERNMENT'S NEWLY ANNOUNCED PROGRAMME FOR THE COMING YEAR 

 FINDS GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE OPPOSITION'S POLICY. THERE. IS TO 

 BE AN EXPANSION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS OF ABOUT 10,000. SOME OF THE  ADDITIONAL MIGRANTS WILL HAVE AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FOR AUSTRALIA.

 THIS IS A WELCOME CHANGE AND IT WILL BEGIN A RESTORATION OF A BALANCE 

 THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 3 YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARGUED ITS 

 CASE FOR INCREASED IMMIGRATION ON A "POPULATE OR PERISH BASIS".

 WE, ON THE OTHER HAND, BELIEVE THE MOST COMPELLING REASONS ARE ECONOMIC

 14

 UNFORTUNATELY. I  DO NOT DEL I  EVE THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO 

 SUSTAIN ITS EXPANDED PROGRAMME AGAINST ITS CRITICS FROM THE LEFT 

 WING OF THE A.L.P. AND THE UNION MOVEMENT. AS THE REAL EXTENT OF  AUSTRALIA'S MISMANAGED CIRCUMSTANCES OF A DEFICIT - FUNDED ECONOMY  IMPACT MORE HEAVILY ON THE WORK-FORCE, "POPULATE OR PERISH" WILL HAVE 

 LITTLE MEANING. PRESERVING THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR WORKFORCE, 15 OR 

 20 YEARS HENCE. CARRIES LITTLE PERSUASION AGAINST THE IMMEDIATE CLAIMS 

 OF MILITANT UNION LEADERS OR THE SPEND-THRIFT POLICIES OF THE LEFT. 

 EXPANDED MIGRATION WILL NOT SOLVE THE RATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE  PROPOSITION OF A MIGRATION LEAD RECOVERY IS. UNREALISTIC, HOWEVER,

 A BALANCED SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAMME WILL ^ASSIST IN RECOVERY.

 I  QUOTE FROM KENNETH DAVIDSON'S ARTICLE IN THE "AGE" OF JUNE 2ND.

 1986 "BEFORE INVITING MIGRANTS EN MASSE. WE MUST GET ECONOMIC 

 HOUSE IN ORDER" IN WHICH HE SAID"

 IN 1985-86. ONLY 10,000 MIGRANTS WERE RECRUITED FOR THEIR 

 SKILLS AND A FURTHER 1800 WERE RECRUITED FOR THEIR BUSINESS SKILLS

 IT IS PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY THAT ONLY THE 15 PER CENT OF 

 MIGRANTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED FOR THEIR POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION  TO THE ECONOMY WOULD HAVE A LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY HIGHER THAN THE 

 AVERAGE FOR THE RESIDENT WORKFORCE,

 AND CONVERSELY, THE 85 PER CENT OF MIGRANTS WHO COME UNDER 

 VARIOUS NON ECONOMIC CRITERIA WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A LEVEL OF 

 PRODUCTIVITY LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE FQR THE RESIDENT WORKFORCE.

 15

 PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT AND POSSIBLY MEDIUM TERM.

 THUS. IT FOLLOWS THAT GIVEN THE PRESENT MIX OF IMMIGRANTS. THEY  ARE PROBABLY TENDING TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL INCREASE IN LIVING  STANDARDS FOR THE POPULTATION AS A WHOLE."

 INCREASES IN MIGRATION DEMAND A BALANCED PROGRAMME. BALANCE IS THE .  

 MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR MIGRATION PLANNING.

 THE GREATER THE LEVEL OF ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT MIGRANTS WHO 

 ARE YOUNG, EDUCATED AND EMPLOYABLE AND WHO BRING AND CREATE  INVESTMENT. THE GREATER THE OPPORTUNITY AND CAPACITY FOR THE * AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO ABSORB ECONOMICALLY DEPENDENT MIGRANTS.

 AT A TIME WHEN.GREAT PRESSURE IS PRESENT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF  

 GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC SECTOR EXPENDITURE. IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE  

 TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF MIGRANTS WHO HAVE A MARGINAL PROPENSITY  

 TO CONSUME. AND WHO WOULD BE DEPENDENT UPON GOVERNMENT-BASED EXPENDITURE  

 THE OBVIOUS NECESSITY IS TO ATTRACT THOSE MIGRANTS WHOSE SKILLS GIVE   THEM A HIGH MARGINAL PROPENSITY TO INVEST. PRIVATELY-FUND lU 

 CONSUMPTION. ADDITIONAL PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT AND INVESTMENT IS  

 CREATED BY MIGRANTS WITH SKILLS.

 STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE LABOUR FORCE PROPORTION  OF SETTLER-ARRIVALS IS LOWER THAN THE EQUIVALENT PROPORTION FOR  THE AUSTRALIAN POPULATION WHEN THERE IS A HIGHER DEPENDENCY ON 

 FAMILY MIGRATION.

 16

 NORMAN FISHER QUANTIFIED THIS AS A COMPA 

 TO 46% WHEN FAMILY REUNI ON-BIASED PROGR 

 THE AUSTRALIAN POPULATION.

 RISON OF 41% PARTICIPATION  AMMES ARE COMPARED TO

 WE MUST REALISE THAT THE FLOW OF MIGRATION CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSISTENCY AND CONTINUITY OF AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH.  AND THAT LONG-TERM PLANNING ALLOWS A HIGHER DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY 

 TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH PERCEIVED LABOUR-SHORTAGE AREAS.

 FOR THESE REASONS. IT CAN BE STRONGLY ARGUED THAT A YEARLY

 SETTING OF THE MIGRATION INTAKE IS NOT THE SOUNDEST APPROACH.

 CREATING PROGRAMME PLANNING WITH SUBSTANCE, THE ABILITY TO ENCOURAGE 

 ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL STOCK. INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY 

 OF THE WORKFORCE BY MEETING SPECIFIC PROBLEM AREAS. AND BY PROVIDING 

 LEAD-TIMES FOR THE CHANCE OF RATIONAL l|NFR A-STRUCTURE, IS ENHANCED.

 IN PAYING TRIBUTE TO CEDA, NEVILLE NORMAN. KATHRYN MEIKLE AND 

 THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC[AFFAIRS, I  AM COMPELLED TO  INDICATE THAT CONTINUING RESEARCH MUST]BE ENCOURAGED ACROSS A RANGE OF CURRENT ECONOMIC ISSUES SUCH AS THE!EFFECTS OF MIGRATION ON  '  ·  .  â   â   '  .  ; ·  ,  i  .  -  â   .  . 

 EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT: THE CONTRIBUTION TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. 

 SAVING AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: THE LEVEL OF REQUIRED 

 GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON SOCIAL INVESTMENT AND THE LABOUR MARKET,

 17

 THE ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE OF IMMIGRATION CAN BE FURTHER JUST!Î   CO  

 BY THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION THAT MIGRATION MAKES. IT  

 WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE, IN THE OPPOSITION.  

 DO NOT HAVE A COMMITMENT TO T hE REUNION OF FAMILIES OR TO THE   COMPASSIONATE SIDE OF IMMIGRATION. THEY HAVE CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO OUR   NATION. '

 WHILST I  HAVE ARGUED THAT INCREASED MIGRATION IS ECONOMICALLY

 BENEFICIAL. PROVIDED THAT THE BALANCE OF THE MIGRATION “MIX- IS WEIGHTED TOWARDS MIGRANTS WHO ARE ECONOMICALLY POSITIVE. WE WOULD

 BE MORE THAN UNFAIR TO OUR POPULATION AND TO THOSE NEWCOMERS WHOM WE WOULD WANT TO SO WARMLY WELCOME, UNLESS WE COULD ENSURE THAT WE  CA-v) 

 COtit^ECONOMICALLY AFFORD NEW MIGRANTS: AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY 

 THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A SOUND ECONOMIC FUTURE IN THEIR NEWLY CHOSEN  HOME.

 t  SUGGEST THAT WHAT JOHN HOWARD SAYS IN REPLY TO MR. HAWKE'S SPEECH ‘   TO THE NATION WILL BE OF FAR GREATER SIGNIFICANCE TO SOUND IMMIGRATION 

 POLICY THAN THE REMARKS #  THE PRIME M I N I S T E R / ^  'r o ' v>C ,H  i .
