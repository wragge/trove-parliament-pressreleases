 Migration Bill Doomed

 In a dissenting Report on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1994 the  Australian Democrats recommended that the Bill be rejected. Coalition Senators made  a similar recommendation.

 "The Government's intention to go ahead with the Bill flies in the face of the evidence  taken by the Committee," Senator Sid Spindler, Australian Democrat Spokesperson  on Law & Justice and Ethnic Affairs, said today.

 "The Bill would retrospectively authorise detention of asylum seekers and remove the  right to obtain compensation for unlawful detention even as the matter is before the  High Court with an unfavourable decision expected by the Government.

 "To pass this Bill would be to condone an executive government changing the law to  avoid legal liability.

 "The Bill offends against the principle of separation of powers, against the right of  citizens to obtain just compensation when property or a right to property is  appropriated by government.

 "It is also likely to be challenged on the grounds that the Bill deals with matters  beyond the constitutional power to legislate on matters concerning aliens.

 "The Bill if passed would be subject to challenge and hence would prolong rather than  end the now long drawn out process in the Courts.

 "It must be rejected," Senator Spindler concluded.
