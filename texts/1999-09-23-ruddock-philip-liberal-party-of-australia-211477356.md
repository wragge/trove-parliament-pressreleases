  IMMIGRATION MINISTER ANNOUNCES 
BOOST TO SETTLEMENT SERVICES

  

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today launch ed a new website providing valuable assistance to 
migrants and refugees settling in Australia.

  

 “This website, Settling in Australia, provides clear 
information that will assist migrants and refugees to become part of 
the community,” the Minister said.

  

 “The site contains over 200 pages of text, and hundreds 
of electronic links to other sites providing information on a range 
of issues from quarantine, taxation and health insurance through to 
information on Australia’s climate and its indigenous people.

  

 “Around 42 per cent of the current population was 
born overseas or has a parent born overseas. As a consequence, many 
of us have first-hand experience or are familiar with what is involved 
in settling in a new country.

  

 “Many tasks, such as finding a job, enrolling children 
at school, talking to a doctor, or opening a bank account, can be daunting 
for someone new to Australia.

  

 “Accessing this information through the website 
will help ease the transition to a new life and establish links to mainstream 
services. This will ultimately help people make their way as independent 
members of Australian society,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 “The site can also be accessed by potential migrants 
offshore, which may assist in making decisions about migrating to Australia.”

  

 “The links to Government departments, Migrant Resource 
Centres, Migrant Service Agencies and other settlement-related sites 
means there is a much greater capacity to meet the information needs 
of our new settlers.

  

 “Settlement in Australia is an example of information 
technology at its best, as it provides a coordinated, comprehensive 
and consistent approach to the delivery of settlement information,” 
the Minister concluded.
