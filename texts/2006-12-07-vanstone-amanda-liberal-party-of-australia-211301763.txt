 Legislative changes to improve review tribunal processes 

 7 December 2006 

 Review tribunal processes will be more efficient and flexible under legislative changes  introduced into Parliament today, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda  Vanstone said today. 

 ‘The amendments to review arrangements for the Migration Review Tribunal [MRT] and the  Refugee Review Tribunal [RRT] will preserve procedural fairness for visa applicants while  also providing for more flexibility and faster completion of cases,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘The amendments provide that where an applicant is at a hearing before a tribunal, the  tribunal member will have discretion to either orally provide the applicant with procedural  fairness during the hearing or do so in writing.  

 ‘Before the amendments, this could only be done in writing, even if the issue had already  been thoroughly canvassed at the hearing. 

 ‘The amendments will also expressly require the tribunals, when applying the procedural  fairness requirements and procedures, to act in a way that is fair and just. 

 ‘If a tribunal advises the applicant at hearing about any adverse information, the member  must also tell the applicant that he or she may ask for more time to respond. 

 ‘If the applicant asks for more time, and the tribunal considers that this request is  reasonable, the tribunal must adjourn the review. 

 ‘The amendments will also provide that the tribunals are not obliged to provide an applicant  with information already given by the applicant to the department as part of the process  leading to the decision under review.  

 ‘This will help the RRT comply with its statutory 90-day time limit for finalising decisions.’
