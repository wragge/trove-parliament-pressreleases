 Senator Kay Patterson Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Media Release

 9/3/2000

 Irish Prime Minister To View Immigration Services The Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, will get a first-hand look at Australia's immigration settlement services in action on Monday (March 13) when he visits the Canterbury-Bankstown Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) and Campsie Australian Centre for Languages.

 The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kay Patterson, will accompany Mr Ahern, and his partner Celia Larkin, during the visit.

 Mr Ahern's visit will include a presentation on Australia's settlement programs by the Regional Manager of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) Parramatta Office, Greg Kelly.

 After the presentation, Mr Ahern and Ms Larkin will tour the resource centre to view an English class for Korean speakers and community worker interviews, and talk to humanitarian workers and staff from the Tenancy Advice Service. The pair will then tour the languages facility before departing.

 Patrick Bourne, from the Embassy of Ireland, said the Prime Minister included the visit in his itinerary so he could learn about Australia's settlement services, which are regarded as being at the forefront of practices world-wide.

 "Because of its recent economic success, Ireland is for the first time having to deal with refugee and humanitarian migration. Inward migration is a new phenomenon for us," Mr Bourne said.

 "Australia has a long tradition of dealing with immigration issues and has well-established models and processes to study. Mr Ahern will get the chance to look at Australia's best-practice settlement services with the aim of helping establish migrant centres and other services in Ireland."

 DIMA provides funding for a national network of 30 MRCs, three MRC outreach services and four Migrant Service Agencies across Australia, to help them meet the settlement needs of overseas-born residents.

 This financial year, DIMA has allocated almost $27 million for migrant community services, $8.8 million of which was provided for MRCs and MSAs. A further $1.13 million was made available for humanitarian workers at some of the facilities. 

 The Canterbury Bankstown MRC has received $321,000 funding for the 1999/2000 financial year and award funding of $146,000 (over three years) for settlement services.
