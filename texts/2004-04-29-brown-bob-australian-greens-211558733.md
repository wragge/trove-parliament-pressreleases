 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania   

 

 High Court ruling on refugee children ‘barbaric’ - Brown 

 29th Apr 04 

 The ruling of the High Court that effectively means five children released from Baxter  detention centre can be returned from Adelaide to behind the razor wire is barbaric,  Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.   

 “The plight of the children, aged 7 to 15, will add to the worldwide view that  Australia is callous and racist - the original sin here is the Howard government’s but  the whole country will be demonised.   

 “No reasonable human being can agree to this jailing of innocents - the Greens will  oppose it at every opportunity,” Senator Brown said.
