 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 Greens: 10 years since the SIEV X  tragedy, how far have we come?   

 Ten years to the day a boat carrying asylum seekers sank with the loss of 353 lives, another  boat has been intercepted with the passengers again seeking Australia’s protection.   

 “We should all reflect on this sad day in which men, women and 146 children drowned,”  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today.   

 “A decade since that tragedy, at least four other boats have sank or been shipwrecked, with  the loss of more than 255 lives.   

 “The latest boat marooned on Scott Reef demonstrates that people are still taking that  dangerous journey by boat because they want Australia’s help and need our protection.   

 “A decade on, the major parties continue to use the same language to denigrate fragile  people and maintain the false hysteria that Australia is constantly under attack by asylum  seekers.   

 “There are two positives to note this year - the High Court’s ruling off-shore assessments is  now illegal, and the resumption of on-shore checking of claims for protection, even if this  has been done somewhat   reluctantly by the government.    

 “The Greens hope the government and other proponents of mandatory detention will come  to realise years of demonising people who use boats to flee persecution diminishes us a  country.”
