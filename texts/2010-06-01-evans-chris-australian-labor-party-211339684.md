 Liberal fear campaign turns on children  Monday, 1 June 2010 

 The Liberal Party has stooped to new lows in its fear and loathing campaign in  relation to asylum seekers, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Evans said today. 

 'In yet another cynical move, Liberal Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison has  sought to rewrite history and deceive Australians about the current treatment of  children in detention,' Senator Evans said. 

 'It beggars belief the Liberal Party would seek to lecture the Rudd Government on  the detention of children. 

 'Under the Howard Government thousands of children were held, sometimes for  years on end, behind barbed wire fences in immigration detention centres.' 

 The Human Rights Commission's 2004 National Inquiry into Children in Immigration  Detention found:  

 â¢ there were 976 children in immigration detention in  Australia in 1999-2000 (76.6% of whom had arrived  by boat) 

 â¢ there were 1923 in 2000-2001 (84% by boat)  â¢ there were 1696 in 2001-2002 (84.9% by boat). 

 The highest number of children held in detention at any one time between 1 January  1999 and 1 January 2004 was 842 on 1 September 2001.  

 The Commission's Inquiry also found that by December 2003, children had spent an  average of one year, eight months and 11 days in detention. 

 Senator Evans reiterated Labor's long-held commitment to ensuring that children  were not held in immigration detention centres. 

 'Mr Morrison knows that all children currently in immigration detention are being  appropriately accommodated in community detention and alternative places of  detention, just as children were in the final years of the Howard government,'  Minister Evans said. 

 'To suggest otherwise is cheap and misleading. 

 'Labor has a fair, balanced and reasonable approach to the complex issue of asylum  seekers. We will not engage in baseless fear campaigns and we will not politicise the  plight of children in detention care.'
