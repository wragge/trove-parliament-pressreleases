 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP  MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 4 April 2013   

 Another group of Sri Lankans sent home 

 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Brendan O’Connor has today announced another group of  Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals were flown home from Christmas Island to Colombo. 

 The group of 20 were advised of its status and that all of its members were subject to removal from  Australia as none of them raised issues that engaged Australia’s international obligations.  

 Without a valid visa they had no legal right to remain in Australia.  

 All were recent arrivals. 

 Since August 13 last year, 963 Sri Lankans have returned home - 756 of them involuntarily. 

 “When people arrived to Australia unauthorised, any claims they make for their reasons to travel to  Australia are assessed by the Department of Immigration. If these claims are not covered by the  refugee convention, they will be returned to their home land wherever possible,” Mr O’Connor said. 

 “People who pay smugglers are risking their lives and throwing their money away. 

 “There is no visa on arrival, there is no speedy outcome, and there is no special treatment. 

 “We are committed to breaking the evil people smuggling trade, deterring people from taking  dangerous journeys by boat and saving lives at sea. 

 “We will continue to transfer people to Nauru and Manus Island.” 

 People returned involuntarily do not have access to reintegration assistance.
