 ACT Arrivals Increase by 10 Per Cent in 2003-04

 VPS 005/2005

 The ACT attracted the third largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 More than 1000 people arrived and settled in the ACT in 2003-04, an increase of nearly 400 from the 1997-98 low of 650, and up nearly 100 from  the previous year’s total of 957, an increase of 10 per cent.

 ‘The increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1993-94 just 800 settlers arrived in the ACT,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘This means that in the past 10 years ACT arrivals have increased by over 30 per cent and the national increase has been 60 per cent, with well over  200 countries represented.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.’

 Australia-wide, the largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South  Africa, the Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
