 THE HON TANYA PLIBERSEK MP  DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND  INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 

 MEDIA STATEMENT    

 LABOR BACKS CALL FOR MORE HELP TO SOUTH SUDAN    

 Australia can and should do more in response to the food crisis in South Sudan.    

 The ‘fair share’ analysis released by Oxfam shows Australia should be  contributing around $26 million this year - almost twice the amount it currently  does.    

 Instead of lifting our efforts, the largest single cut in the Abbott Government’s  Budget was to foreign aid, with one in every five dollars saved at the expense of  the world’s poor.    

 Now we are seeing the Government having to provide emergency humanitarian  aid to countries where they have cut Australia’s normal aid program earlier in the  year, like Iraq and the Palestinian Territories.    

 In the last two years of the Labor Government, the aid provided to Syria was  more than three times the amount given by the Abbott Government to date,  even though the number of refugees in need is increasing every day.    

 The Government’s $7.6 billion cuts to foreign aid are a blow to the ability of  countries in the developing world to build up their stability, independence and  self-reliance.    

 It is in Australia’s interests to help countries build stable and thriving economies  and societies, rather than waiting to respond to a humanitarian crisis.    

 Like the Abbott Government’s short-sighted cuts in so many other areas, their  cuts to foreign aid are setting us up for much larger costs down the track.    

 And, as always, the Abbott Government places the heaviest burden on the  people least able to shoulder it.
