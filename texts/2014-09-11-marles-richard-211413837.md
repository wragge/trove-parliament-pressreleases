 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 HIGH COURT EXPOSES SCOTT MORRISON’S POLICY FAILURE 

 The Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has been dealt an embarrassing blow with  the High Court today ruling his attempt to offer a refugee a temporary visa as  invalid. 

 Scott Morrison has been so utterly absorbed in looking the part that he has dropped  the ball in running his portfolio competently. 

 Today’s High Court decision comes just a day after he announced a monumental  backflip, putting Australia back on the table for people that arrived after July 19 of  last year. 

 Scott Morrison has been forced to take this step to hide his failure in managing the  Regional Resettlement Arrangement with Papua New Guinea. 

 The Regional Resettlement Arrangement drew a line in the sand, which took  Australia off the table after July 19 of last year and has been the most effective  policy in preventing the flow of asylum seeker vessels to Australia.
