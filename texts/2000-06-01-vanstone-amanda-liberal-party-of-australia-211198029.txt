 27 boat people detained off WA

 A total of 27 boat people have been detained at Ashmore Islands off the north-west coast of WA, Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced today.

 The 27 people, believed to be of Middle Eastern origin, were travelling on a motorised fishing vessel crewed by two people.

 The vessel was intercepted by the Customs vessel, Wauri, which is patrolling the area.

 Customs Coastwatch has tasked the Customs vessel, Roebuck Bay, to assist the Wauri with transporting people to the mainland.

 Senator Vanstone said the people would be handed to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for processing once they reached the mainland.

 "Today’s interception demonstrates the efficiency of Australia’s coastal surveillance system. Despite the remoteness of Ashmore Islands, which are more than 600km from the mainland, officials were on the spot to make a rapid interception," Senator Vanstone said.
