 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/880 THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER 2004   SENATOR NATASHA STOTT DESPOJA SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA'S SIX YEARS OF SHAME The Australian Democrats today called for immediate Ministerial intervention in the case of Mr Peter Qasim, who has been in Australian immigration detention for six full years.  Senator for South Australia Natasha Stott Despoja has written to the Prime Minister urging him to demonstrate compassion in relation to Mr Qasim's case and grant him a visa as a matter of urgency. "Mr Qasim has not committed any crime yet he has now been detained for longer than some convicted criminals such as rapists," Senator Stott Despoja said. "As a Kashmiri man whom the Indian Government refuses to recognise, Mr Qasim is effectively 'stateless' and is trapped in bureaucratic limbo.  "Although he has been eligible for deportation since January 1999 and signed documents requesting this deportation more than a year ago, the Department of Immigration is unable to return him.  "He has approached more than 80 countries to grant him asylum but, so far, none have agreed to accept him. "Following last monthâ€™s High Court ruling on indefinite detention, Mr Qasim now faces the possibility of being detained in Australia for the rest of his natural life unless the Government intervenes in his case. "I urge the Government to exercise one of the many forms of Ministerial intervention available, including granting Mr Qasim a refugee visa or - at a bare minimum - a bridging visa.  "This would at least allow Mr Qasim to live in the community among his many friends and supporters while efforts to deport him continue. "It is heartless and inhumane for the Government to detain people for such long periods of time. The Democrats understand many people at Baxter have been in immigration detention in Australia for around four years and do not know when, or if, they will be released. "The Minister for Immigration has said she is the safety-valve preventing lifetime detention for stateless people - it is high time she exercised that power in the case of Peter Qasim," Senator Stott Despoja said.
