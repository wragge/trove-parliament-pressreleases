 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling SIX BOATS IN THREE DAYS AS  GOVERNMENT REMAINS LOCKED IN CRISIS  OF THEIR OWN MAKING July 18, 2012

 The  latest  illegal  boat  arrival,  with  65  people  on  board,  is  the  sixth boat in three days  and  comes  as  this  dysfunctional government  cannot  even  agree  with  itself  on  border  protection,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Not  only  have  Labor  sought  to  distance  themselves  from  their  own  expert  panel  by  reserving  their  position  on  its recommendations, they remain at war with their alliance partners on the committee they set up to solve the problem," Mr Morrison said. 

 "This  is  Government  that  can't  even  outsource  their  responsibilities,  without  tying  themselves  up  in  knots.  The Government's  Alliance  committee  on  asylum  seekers  of  Labor,  Greens  and  the  Independents  who  met  in  Canberra yesterday demonstrated again why this Government is so dysfunctional on protecting our borders. 

 "Labor and the Greens have weakened our borders by abolishing the policies that worked and now they refuse to restore them. 

 "If Labor wants to insist on their abominable Malaysian people swap then they must demand support for from their alliance partners  as  a  matter  of  confidence.  It's  not  up  to  the  Coalition  to  support  bad  policy.  We  have  a  clear  and  proven alternative set of alternative measures. 

 "If the Government's alliance partners in the Greens and Independents refuse to support the Government on their illegal Malaysian People Swap they should either call an election or simply move to restore the proven policies of the Coalition. 

 "People smugglers are continuing to take advantage of Labor’s inaction with over 800 people already arriving this month  on 14 boats, as arrivals trend at double the government’s estimate of 450 people a month they based their budget on," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr  Keenan  said:  "The  collapsed  state  of  Labor’s  border  protection  regime  has  brought  six  illegal  boats  in  less  than  72 hours  to  our  shores,  an  indication  that  the  people  smugglers  are  taking  advantage  of  a  Government  that  needs  a committee to tell it what to do. 

 "While the Gillard Government continues to navelâgaze and delay putting in place a real solution, the boats continue to arrive in record numbers and our men and women of Border Protection Command are left operating under a policy free zone. 

 "With 6,090 people having already arrived this year, compared with 4,730 arrivals for the whole of 2011, this year will be enormously lucrative for people smugglers who are not going to be deterred until they see some real resolve in Canberra. 

 "Border Protection Command is being used as a taxi service shuttling illegal boats from Indonesian waters to Australia. 

 "It is far past the time that this Government swallowed their political pride and just reâinstalled the Coalition’s successful  policies that they dismantled when they came to Government," Mr Keenan said.
