 STATEMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT BY THE HON STEWART WEST MP  

 M IN ISTE R  FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC A FFA IR S ,

 ON A U S TR A LIA 'S  IMMIGRATION POLICY AND PROGRAM

 I WISH TO INFORM THE HOUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISIONS 

 CONCERNING AUSTRALIA'S IMMIGRATION POLICY AND THE SIZE AND 

 COMPOSITION OF THE 1983/84 IMMIGRATION PROGRAM,

 Preamble

 The Government has reaffirmed  the nine principles  underlying MIGRATION POLICY, I n SUMMARY THESE ARE:

 1, The Australian  Government alone decides who can 

 enter Au s t r a lia ,

 2, Migr’ants must provide some benefit to Australia , ALTHOUGH THIS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE A MAJOR 

 CONSIDERATION IN THE CASE OF REFUGEES AND FAMILY 

 MEMBERS.

 3, The migrant intake should not jeopardise  social COHESIVENESS AND HARMONY IN THE AUSTRALIAN 

 COMMUNITY, .

 4, I mmigration  policy and selection  is non- disciminatory ,

 5, Applicants  are considered  as individuals  or individual FAMILY UNITS, NOT AS COMMUNITY GROUPS,

 6, Su i t a b i l i t y  standards for migrants reflect  Australian  law and social customs,

 7, Migrants must intend to settle permanently ,

 8, Settlement  in closed enclaves is not-encouraged ,

 9, Migrants should integrate  into Austr alia ' s MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY BUT ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY 

 TO PRESERVE AND DISSEMINATE THEIR ETHNIC HERITAGE,

 The q u e s t i o n  of i m m i g r a t i o n  i n t a k e  i s alw ays  p o t e n t i a l l y

 CONTROVERSIAL ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC RECESSION,

 I t HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT IMMIGRATION CAN BE STIMULATORY AT  

 ANY TIME AS NEW ARRIVALS CREATE EXTRA DEMAND FOR GOODS AND  

 SERVICES PARTICULARLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY,

 Co n v e r s e l y , i t can be argued  t h a t to t a k e la r g e numbers

 DURING SEVERE ECONOMIC RECESSION, WHEN THERE ARE FEW JOBS 

 AVAILABLE, SIMPLY ADDS TO UNEMPLOYMENT AND CREATES EXTRA 

 STRAIN ON BUDGETARY OUTLAYS, THE LABOR GOVERNMENT'S POLICY 

 WILL BE TO STEER A MIDDLE COURSE, REJECTING DEMANDS FOR A 

 MASSIVE REDUCTION IN INTAKE AND AT THE SAME TIME PREVENTING 

 MAJOR INCREASES UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES 

 STIMULATE RECOVERY, ’

 For 1 9 8 2 / 8 3 ,  the o r i g i n a l  e s t i m a t e  of between  115,000 and 

 120,000 HAS ALREADY BEEN REVISED DOWNWARDS TO 90,000 - 9 5 ,0 0 0 ,

 The Mi g r a t i o n  program  for 1983/84 w i l l  be h el d to a c e i l i n g  

 of between  80,0 0 0  and 90,000 v i s a e d  m i g r a n t s , w i t h  no growth

 PROPOSED FOR THE TRIENNIUM UNLESS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IMPROVE 

 SUFFICIENTLY, WlTHIN THIS CEILING OUR STRONG COMMITMENT IS 

 TO THE REUNION OF CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS 

 AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS, AND TO REFUGEES,

 Fa m i l y  Mi g r a t i o n

 In, 1983/84 I e x p e c t  the a p p r o v a l  of between  51,000 and 57,000  m i g r a n t s  i n the f a m i l y  m i g r a t i o n  c a t e g o r y , Fa m i l y  m i g r a t i o n

 CATEGORIES Î '  AND ' B '  I . E .  MAINLY SPOUSES, MINOR CHILDREN, 

 PARENTS AND FIANCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN 26,000 AND 29,000 

 AND SUB-CATEGORY ' C '  I . E .  BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND NON-DEPENDENT 

 CHILDREN BETWEEN 25,0 0 0  AND 2 8 ,0 0 0 . .

 The f o r m e r .Govern men t  had in t r o d u c e d  a p o i n t s  a s s e s s m e n t  system

 UNDER WHICH BROTHERS, SISTERS AND NON-DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF 

 INTENDING SPONSORS ARE ASSESSED BEFORE ALLOWING SPONSORSHIP 

 AND WHICH IS USED WHEN MAKING FINAL ASSESSMENT AT OVERSEAS

 WHICH HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION 

 ON UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A COMMITMENT TO 

 FAMILY REUNION AND ASSISTING REFUGEES,

 I HAVE :

 , REMOVED A CONCESSION GRANTED BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT TO 

 WEALTHY PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 65 WHICH ALLOWED 

 â THEN TO MIGRATE PROVIDED THEY HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF 

 INCOME OR CAPITAL. THESE PERSONS WERE A POTENTIAL ADDITION 

 TO THE LABOUR MARKET AND IT COULD BE INFERRED THAT IT WAS 

 POSSIBLE TO "BUY" PERMANENT RESIDENCE;

 . PREVENTED WORKING HOLIDAY MAKERS IN AUSTRALIA REMAINING 

 PERMANENTLY ON THE GROUNDS OF THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND/OR 

 EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS;

 . CLOSED A LOOP-HOLE UNDER WHICH LARGE NUMBERS OF TEMPORARY 

 RESIDENTS COULD REMAIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY WERE 

 IRREPLACEABLE TO THEIR EMPLOYERS. ONLY THOSE APPLICANTS 

 WHO CAN ESTABLISH BEYOND DOUBT THAT THEY ARE IRREPLACEABLE 

 WILL BE ALLOWED TO CHANGE STATUS; AND

 . SUPPORTED THE INTENSIFIED EFFORTS OF MY DEPARTMENT TO 

 LOCATE AND REMOVE FROM AUSTRALIA PROHIBITED IMMIGRANTS 

 AND OTHERS FOUND WORKING WITHOUT AUTHORITY, ( IT IS 

 ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE 50,000 - 60,000 ILLEGAL 

 IMMIGRANTS IN AUSTRALIA AND THAT 10,000 - 15,000 PER 

 ANNUM. BECOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS).

 ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADDRESSED THE 

 TWIN DILEMMAS OF SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES VERSUS 

 THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF MIGRATION AND THE BENEFITS OF 

 FAMILY MIGRATION VERSUS POSSIBLE UNEMPLOYMENT AND SETTLEMENT 

 D IFF IC U LT IE S , THE DECISIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ARE 

 BALANCED DECISIONS. ÎªÎÎ GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT THERE 

 ARE COSTS, BOTH FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL BUT THERE ARE BENEFITS,

 AND IT IS THESE BENEFITS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT 

 TO MAXIMISE AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST,

 IN DETERMINING THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE MIGRATION  

 PROGRAM THE GOVERNMENT IS BACKING AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE. W e 

 HAVE TRIED TO BALANCE THE VARIOUS COMPETING AND CONFLICTING  

 INTERESTS, W E RECOGNISE THAT THE ECONOMY IS IN RECESSION 

 BUT ALSO RECOGNISE THAT WE HAVE HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS TO 

 PEOPLE FAR WORSE OFF THAN US, CONCENTRATION ON SHORT TERM 

 PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT OBSCURE THE LONGER TERM WHEN WE AND 

 OUR CHILDREN WILL REAP THE BENEFITS OF A LARGER, MORE 

 CULTURALLY DIVERSIFIED AUSTRALIA.
