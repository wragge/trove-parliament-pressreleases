 Afghan asylum seeker deaths shows danger of offshore processing

 The revelations on ABC's Lateline program of the fate of asylum seekers kept on Nauru and forced back  to countries like Afghanistan shows the dangers of offshore processing, according to the Democrats. 

 

 Democrat Deputy Leader, Andrew Bartlett the only Senator to visit refugees on Nauru said the federal  governments long record of deceit and dishonesty in this area means they have lost the right for their  denials to be believed. 

 

 "The Minister is being deliberately dishonest in saying that 'no one was returned involuntarily from  Nauru'."    

 "I am the only Senator who ever bothered to go to Nauru to talk to refugees something the Minister  herself has never done and I can assure her and the public that many asylum seekers were repeatedly  told they had no choice but to return."   

 "I witnessed for myself the way the asylum seekers were treated and the information that was given to  them. The pressure on the asylum seekers to return to Afghanistan was constant, consistent and  unrelenting."    

 "The federal government has repeatedly failed to make any genuine efforts to follow up evidence about  what happens to returned asylum seekers, preferring instead just to smear anyone else who makes the  sometimes very dangerous effort to find out the facts."   

 "The government continues to attack the credibility of the Edmund Rice Centre, yet they refuse to make  any genuine effort to follow up what happens to people who are returned. The Australian public is now  well aware that this government refuses to look for or listen to any information it doesnt want to know  about." 

 

 "A unanimous Senate Committee report recommended over six years ago that efforts should be made to  monitor the fate of returned asylum seekers."   

 "This recommendation was dismissed by the government, in the same way they repeatedly dismissed  any other attempts to clean up their morally bankrupt system."   

 "Many of the refugees from Afghanistan and elsewhere who have been lucky enough to be able to stay  in Australia know of people who were returned and had to flee again, sometimes finally getting protection  in other countries such as Canada or the UK."   

 "The government likes to talk about the 'success' of the Pacific Solution, but the simple fact is that no 

 policy that directly leads to the death of innocent people can be justified, no matter how many votes it  wins."
