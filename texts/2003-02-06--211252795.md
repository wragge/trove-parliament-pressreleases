 Statement by State and federal Australian  parliamentarians  

 We oppose Australian military  participation in bombing and war on  Iraq   We join with millions of Australians to oppose war on Iraq and  Australian military involvement.  

 We are heartened by the opposition to this war expressed by former  prime ministers, retired senior military leaders, community organisations  and the heads of faith organisations, both in Australia and in London and  Rome.  

 The 1991 Gulf War was responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 to  300,000 Iraqis during and within twelve months of it finishing. At least  110,000 of those killed were civilians, mainly as a result of bombing  facilities essential to provide clean water to the Iraqi people. Iraqi society  has been devastated by a decade of economic sanctions. *  

 Civilians are the first casualty of war. War will mean further  humanitarian and environmental devastation, and a flood of new  refugees.  

 Iraqâ€™s military capacity has been significantly degraded since the 1991  Gulf war. Despite the claims, there is no evidence that Iraq presents a  clear and present danger to any nation, nor that it is close to having  nuclear weapons. No evidence has been produced linking Iraq to the  September 11 bombings.  

 We support the abolition by all Middle Eastern states of their stocks of  chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and call for a renewed  commitment by Australia to international disarmament issues. UN  resolutions on disarmament and human rights are most likely to succeed  when nations commit to their implementation without fear or favour.  

 We join with governments and communities around the world to say that  war is not the solution to conflict in the Middle East.
