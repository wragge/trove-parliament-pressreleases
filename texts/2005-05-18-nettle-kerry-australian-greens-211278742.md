 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 Australia - Afghanistan deportation  agreement must be made public 

 18th May 2005 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the  government to release the details of the recently announced  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the government of  Afghanistan.  "The details of this MOU must be revealed to reassure the public that  the government is acting responsibly," said Senator Nettle.  "The Greens have real concerns about the secret MOU signed with Iran  after which many Iranian asylum seekers have been forcibly deported  into dangerous situations. If the government has nothing to hide then  it should release the detail of both the Iranian MOU and the Afghan  MOU.  "The Australian government should not be entering into a secret  Memorandum of Understanding that leads to the deportation of asylum  seekers to countries with appalling human rights records, like  Afghanistan and Iran.  "Given the revelations about the bungled deportation of Vivian Solon,  and given the concerns raised by the Edmund Rice Centre's report  Deported to Danger, the public have the right to know the basis of  what the government is agreeing to in this Afghan MOU.  "In August 2003 an asylum seeker, Mohammad Nazari, deported to  Afghanistan from Nauru was killed by Taliban foot soldiers.  Afghanistan is still a war zone run mainly by war lords. We should be  very careful about returning people to such a situation.  "The Greens believe that given the continuing instability in  Afghanistan, Afghani asylum seekers should be allowed to remain in  Australia and those on Nauru should be brought to the Australian  mainland."
