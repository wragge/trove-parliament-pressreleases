 PRESS RELEASE THE SENATE

 P.R. NO. 85/355 CANBERRA 13 DECEMBER 1985

 CHIPP : AUSTRALIAN/INDONESIAN TALKS THIS WEEKEND MUST NOT BE A SELLOUT.

 Senator Don Chipp, Leader of the Australian Democrats said today  of this weekend's talks between Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr.  Mochtar,  and Mr. Hayden that they should not revolve around the  proposed topic, Kampuchea,  but on sensible, positive discussions 

 on the resolution of the East Timor situation and the Irian Jayan  problem.

 "Dr. Mochtar is no doubt delighted at the prospect of spending a  weekend discussing how Australia and Indonesia can help to solve  problems elsewhere,  but the two places where Indonesia can affect  a change, East Timor and Irian Jaya (and the border refugee 

 situation) has been conveniently left off the agenda.

 "Ten years after the Indonesian invasion of East Timor,  the  Australian Government is colluding with Indonesia to pretend that  all is forgotten and forgiven. This is not the caseÎ¯

 "Nothing in East Timor has been resolved, and Australia has not  lifted a finger to bring about any kind of solution",  Senator  Chipp said.

 "As for the Irian Jayan situation, the Australian Government must  press upon the Indonesian Government the need to alter their  policies in Irian Jaya, or Australia together with PNG will be  faced with the prospect of ever increasing numbers of refugees.

 "While we. would all like to see' a resolution of the Kampuchean  conflict, this must not be ddne St the expense of our immediate  and urgent problems in the re’ g'iOn, East Timor and Irian Jaya" ,   Senator Chipp concluded^ *
