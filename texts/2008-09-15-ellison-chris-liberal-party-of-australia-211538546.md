 Senator the Hon. Christopher Ellison  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 “Labor must declare position on excision of Islands”   

 

 The Coalition Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Ellison today called on the Rudd Labor Government to end it's review of the  immigration excision zone and retain the strong border protection polices of the  Coalition.     

 'The Rudd Labor Government has confirmed that they are continuing to review the  immigration excision zone. Labor should provide certainty to our  border security strategy and end their commitment to the flawed policy of ending the  excision of all islands except Ashmore Reef, Cocos and Christmas Island,' said  Senator Ellison.     

 Despite the success of measures implemented by the Government which resulted in a  significant reduction in the number of unauthorized boats travelling to Australia,  people smuggling networks continue to target Australia.      

 'The threat has not gone away and it would be naÃ¯ve to assume that unwinding these  measures would not result in an increase in attempts to come illegally to Australia,'  said Senator Ellison.      

 To provide the strongest possible deterrent to people smugglers and unauthorised boat  arrivals the Coalition legislated to excise from our migration zone of those Australian  territories off our coast that were magnets for people smugglers.     

  People smugglers charge up to US$10,000 per passenger. They are highly organised 

 international criminal networks with no concern for the people they smuggle or  endangering lives through transportation on unseaworthy vessels packed with human  beings.    

 The Coalition’s strong and effective border control policies successfully stopped mass  the influx of unauthorised boat arrivals.     

  The Coalition’s border protection policy has two objectives: to deter unauthorised 

 arrivals and to deal efficiently and humanely with unauthorised arrivals by either  speedily returning them to their homeland or by offering Australia’s protection if they  are genuine refugees.    

 

 

 The success of these policies clearly demonstrate that the approach taken to dealing  with unauthorised boat arrivals should, and must continue to be, one that is firmly  focused on protecting not only our borders, but also the integrity of Australia’s  immigration programme.
