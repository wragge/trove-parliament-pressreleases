 From the Minister for Immigration _   and Ethnic Affairs. THE HON JOHN HODGES, MP

 '  13 October 1982

 POLISH SHIP'S DESERTERS TO STAY

 Two Polish crew-members . who deserted their ship, the 

 "General Kleeberg" in Fremantle, are to be alloxved to remain 

 in Australia.

 Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, John Hodges, 

 said in Canberra today that subject to normal health and 

 character requirements, the two, a woman and a man, would be 

 given entry permits allowing them to remain in Australia 

 permanently. .  . . .  .  â

 The pair had applied for refugee status, which was

 considered by the Determination of Refugee Status (D.O.R.S.) 

 Committee. The committee advised Mr Hodges that the two  applicants did not qualify for recognition as refugees under 

 the terms of the 1951 Convention and the 1976 Protocol Relating 

 to the Status of Refugees. .

 '*Nevertheless,  the present situation in Poland and the un­

 certainty of the future for these two people convinced me that 

 they should be allowed to stay on humantarian grounds," Mr  Hodges said. .

 Mr Hodges said, officers of the Department of Immigration 

 and Ethnic Affairs would contact the pair soon to complete 

 arrangements for them to stay.
