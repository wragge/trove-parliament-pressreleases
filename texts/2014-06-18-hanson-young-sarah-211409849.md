 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 18 June 2014   

 Greens introduce Bill to stop babies being sent offshore   

 

 The Greens have introduced a Bill in the Senate today that prevents the Government  from deporting vulnerable newborn babies to offshore centres like Nauru.   

 “This Bill rules out the possibility of the Government sending babies offshore into  conditions that are unsuitable for new born babies," Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Bill will ensure that the rights of children who are born in Australia to asylum seeker  parents are upheld and protected.”   

 “Nauru is not an appropriate place for these babies to grow and be cared for; I have  seen these conditions for myself, and it is no place for a child to be raised.    

 “They are here, these children were born in Australia, and they deserve to be cared for  and protected from harm.”   

 “These children and their families are already here in Australia, so the argument of  deterrence doesn't affect them.”   

 “Waking up pregnant women and children in the middle of the night and sending them to  Nauru, or Christmas Island, is no way to treat people who have sought help from our  country.”   

 “In years to come, we will look back on this period of Australian history with shame and  disbelief.”   

 “Children are our future and I hope my Parliamentary colleagues will see the value in  giving these children a better start in life.”
