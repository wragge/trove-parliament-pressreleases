 21 BOATS INTERCEPTED SINCE ABBOTT SAID ‘NO’   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said another asylum seeker boat was intercepted overnight -  the 21st since Tony Abbott chose obstructive negativity over the national interest.   

 “Australians realise that we need a genuine deterrent in place to prevent these types of  dangerous boat journeys - but Tony Abbott continues to stand in the way of offshore  processing,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “The question remains for Mr Abbott: how many more boats have to arrive, how many  more lives risked, before he stops the negativity, puts the national interest ahead of  political interest, and allow the Government of the day to implement its policies?”   

 “This latest boat - carrying 55 passengers - shows that asylum seekers will continue to  risk their lives at sea without a deterrent in place. Let’s not forget the hundreds who  have died on these boats in recent times. We need offshore processing to help ensure  this does not happen again.”   

 Mr Clare said the boats would keep coming while Tony Abbott said no. 

 “Stopping this is within our grasp. Working together we can help stop people dying at  sea. We can pass legislation to introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said. 

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
