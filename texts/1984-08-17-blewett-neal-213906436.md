 NEWS  RELEASE

 FROM THE AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR HEALTH  THE HON. NEAL BLEWETT

 Commonwealth Grant to South Australian Health Researcher

 The Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, today  announced a grant of $45 317 for a study in South Australia  to develop a national surveillance system for the collection  of data on childhood accidental injuries.

 The study was to be conducted by Dr Graham Vimpani,  Research and Evaluation Director of the Child, Adolescent  and Family Health Service of South Australia.

 Dr Blewett said child accidents were the major  cause of death in Australian children aged from one to  fourteen years. At present there was no adequate national  data base to monitor childhood accidents to Australian  children and it was hoped Dr Vimpani1s study would contribute 

 to cost effective strategies to prevent childhhod accidents.

 The grant to Dr Vimpani was one of a number of  grants totalling $162 670 made to health researchers in  Australia under the Health Services Research and Development  Grants Scheme, a Scheme administered by the Commonwealth 

 Department of Health.

 For further information on the above project contact:
