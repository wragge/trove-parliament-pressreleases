  MINISTER ANNOUNCES 1999-2000 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM

  

  Australi a’s 1999-2000 Humanitarian Program will again consist 
of 12,000 places including an estimated 10,000 places for offshore applicants 
and 2,000 for onshore applicants, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

  

 Mr Ruddock said that it was also likely that some 
humanitarian places from 1998-99 would not be used, and these will be 
rolled over into 1999-2000.

  

 “These places will be used in the 1999-2000 program 
year to meet resettlement needs for refugees and others in humanitarian 
need, including people from the former Yugoslavia who have been identified 
by the UNHCR as needing resettlement.

  

 Mr Ruddock said the Government was committed to delivering 
an effective and well targeted Humanitarian Program that puts the resettlement 
needs of genuine refugees first.

  

 “Australia is a leading humanitarian resettlement 
country and our commitment has been commended by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, Madam Ogata.

  

 “The Humanitarian Program is designed to help victims 
of human rights abuses who may not have any other option than to be 
resettled. To ensure the focus continues to be on helping this group, 
there will be greater flexibility in how program places are managed.

  

 “This will involve rolling over unused places into 
the next program year or bringing places forward from future programs 
if they are required because of a humanitarian crisis.

  

 “This will ensure that all places allocated to the 
program are used. In the past, some places were lost because some people 
who were granted humanitarian visas were unable to travel.

  

 “The effect of these changes will be to ensure that 
the program makes the fullest possible contribution to humanitarian 
needs, without wastage of places.

  

 “Last year Australia and other resettlement countries 
gave some 25,000 refugees a new home in cooperation with UNHCR and they 
have sought our assistance to continue resettlement in the coming year.”

  

 The Humanitarian Program will again be comprised of 
four key components:

  

  1.   Refugee:  4,000 
places have been allocated for people who meet requirements based on 
the United Nations Convention definition of a refugee and have been 
identified in conjunction with UNHCR as in need of resettlement;

  

  2.   Special Humanitarian 
Program  (SHP): 4,300 places have been allocated for those who 
have suffered discrimination amounting to gross violation of human rights 
and who have strong support from an Australian citizen or resident or 
a community group in Australia;

  

  3.   Special Assistance 
Category (SAC):  900 places have been allocated for those who, 
while not meeting the Refugee or Special Humanitarian criteria, are 
nonetheless in situations of discrimination, displacement or hardship. 
Most SACs require proposers of applicants to be close family members 
resident in Australia.

  

  4.   Onshore Protection 
Visa Grants:  2,000 places have been allocated within the Humanitarian 
Program for refugees granted Protection Visas in Australia.

  

  Some 800 places will be kept unallocated for contingencies during 
the year.

  

  “Priority i n the Humanitarian Program will continue to be 
given to the regions of the former Yugoslavia. In addition, we will 
continue to provide places for the Middle East and Africa.

  

 “I will be announcing further details of the allocation 
of Humanitarian Program places to particular regions in the coming weeks.

  

 “These allocations will reflect the refugee resettlement 
priorities of UNHCR and the views of members of the Australian community 
including the obvious concern known by Australians for the persons displaced 
from Kosovo.”
