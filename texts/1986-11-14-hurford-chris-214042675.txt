 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 NEWS RELEASE

 MPS 120/86

 AN VENG ARRIVES NEXT MONDAY

 Mr An Veng,  the former driver and sound assistant to the late   Australian journalist Neil Davis, will arrive in Australia next   Monday (17 November).

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Chris Hurford,   announced in September that An Veng and his family had been   approved for entry to Australia under the refugee program.

 Mr Hurford said today travel arrangements had now been made and   the family - An Veng, his wife and sole remaining son - would   fly into Sydney on Monday on Qantas Flight QF32 due at 10.50am.

 The Minister said Australia was proud to welcome the family.

 "The events leading to the tragic death of Neil Davis in   Bangkok last year are well known," he said.

 "An Veng played a major role in Davis' life, and it is fitting   that Australia should offer a new start to the family as a form   of memorial to Neil Davis."

 Mr Hurford said the family had been undergoing refugee   processing in Thailand since February this year.
