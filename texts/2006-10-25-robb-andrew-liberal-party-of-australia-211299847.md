  THE HON ANDREW ROBB A 0  MP 

  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  OPPORTUNITY TO PAKTlCIPATE IN AUSTRALIAN LIFE 

  Opportunity and respect and commonsense are the keystones of the Government’s approach 

  to the proposed Citizenship test and achieving effective integration of new migrants. 

  “The proposal for a formal citizenship test is one of many initiatives to assist quick and 

  effective integration. The test will help to convey to new arrivals the expectations of the 

  broader Australian community regarding the privilege of citizenship and the desire to see new 

  citizens as truly functional members of our community” the Parliamentary Secretary the Hon 

  Andrew Robb A 0  M P  said today in addressing the Jewish National Fund Gold Patron’s 

  Lunch in Melbourne. 

  hlr Robb specifically refuted claims that the proposed new test implied that there had been  serious mistakes in our policy of integration over the last sixty years. 

  “On the contrary I consider that compared to other Western Countries, Australia has been 

  remarkably successful at integrating more than 6.5 million people into our Australian family 

  from over 200 countries around the world” 

  He also stated that the criticism of the proposed test on the basis that “if it ain’t broke don’t 

  fur it” was misplaced, as it failed to take account of the fact that the reason we had been so 

  successful is because we have never “stopped fixing it” 

  “We have not been complacent; we have continually sought to improve the system of 

  integrating the large numbers of migrants and refugees coming to Australia, we can’t stop 

  now”.

  Changes in the Australian economy, migration patterns and the fact that Australia will be 

  bringing in migrants from cultures quite different to ours all meant that we will need to keep 

  working hard on successful integration strategies. In particular the Government sees the 

  proposed Citizenship test as providing an incentive to learn a basic level of English and a 

  great knowledge of Australia so that new arrivals can make the most of the many 

  opportunities available in Australia.
