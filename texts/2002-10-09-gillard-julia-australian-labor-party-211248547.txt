 MURDER OF REJECTED COLOMBIAN ASYLUM SEEKER AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR ACCURATE COUNTRY INFORMATION

 Reports that a rejected Colombian asylum seeker was murdered by paramilitaries upon returning to his country further emphasise the need for extreme care to be taken when assessing protection claims and for country information to be regularly updated.

 The man had claimed asylum in Australia but left when the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) rejected his application.  He then travelled to Argentina and made an asylum claim before being deported to Colombia where he was shot.

 Information used by DIMIA and the RRT on conditions in the asylum seeker’s home country is, simply put, sometimes too optimistic and often glosses over the risks facing the asylum seeker if they are to be returned.  Accurate and current country information is crucial to make an assessment of an asylum seeker’s protection claims.  It is vital that a wide diversity of very contemporary sources are utilised, to ensure US and Australian Government analyses are not compromised by their relationships with particular countries.

 Recently the Department’s own auditors, Ernst & Young, found that country information was not gleaned from sufficiently broad sources and was not updated to take developments in origin countries into account.  The importance of this information cannot be underestimated - it is, quite literally, a matter of life and death in many cases.

 There are more than 100 cases involving protection claims by Colombians pending in Australia.  I trust that Departmental decision makers and RRT officials will exercise extreme caution in dealing with the processing of these cases, given the violent realities of Colombia’s circumstances.  Labor supports fast and fair processing, but only if country information is accurate.
