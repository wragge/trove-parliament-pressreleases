 End the Embarrassing Excised Territories Policy

 The Australian Greens have called on the Federal Government to scrap its policy of excised territories, 

 including Christmas Island, according to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. 

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, says the political 

 bickering between the Government and Coalition over the toughness of the policy obscures the fact that it 

 is a breach of Australia's international obligations to asylum-seekers. 

 "The shouting match between the old parties over the movement of asylum-seekers to the mainland shows 

 they have learned nothing from Australia's recent history,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "The excised territories policy is a throwback to the Howard era, designed to show a government's 

 "toughness" on asylum-seekers, but it should not have been law then, and should not be law now. 

 "Cutting islands out of Australia's borders to reduce asylum-seekers' legal rights is a clear breach of our 

 international obligations and is damaging to Australia's international reputation. It's also highly impractical, 

 and now the policy is also apparently under a cloud of legal uncertainty. 

 "It‘s very simple - the Rudd Government needs to move on from the Howard years and scrap its policy of 

 excised territories.'' 

 Senator Hanson-Young says the Greens have always said that Christmas Island was an inappropriate 

 place of detention, but the increasingly angry debate between the old parties ignores this reality. 

 

 "Asylum-seekers should be treated with compassion, not used as a political football by the Government 

 and Coalition in a desperate race-to-the-bottom on immigration policy,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "The presence of asylum seekers on the Australian mainland is neither a security crisis nor a policy 

 catastrophe. We need to bring them to Australia and deal with their claims quickly, fairly and humanely.''
