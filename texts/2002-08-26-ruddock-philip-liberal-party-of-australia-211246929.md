 Minister Welcomes Extension of Tax Deductability for Gifts to UNHCR

 MPS 079/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Philip Ruddock today welcomed the decision to extend the period during which tax deductible gifts of $2 or more can be made to the Australia for UNHCR.

 The extension was announced today by Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer Senator Helen Coonan.

 "I welcome all efforts to assist the UNHCR in the performance of their important work around the world," said Mr Ruddock.

 "Australia is an important contributor to the UNHCR both financially and through it's humanitarian program where it is one of only 10 or so countries to operate a dedicated program resettling those refugees who remain at risk."

 The Minister urged Australian's to make a donation to the Australia for UNHCR.
