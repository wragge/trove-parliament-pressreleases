 Howard’s Denial No Comfort for Australians 

 

 

 The Prime Minister is fooling no-one but himself in denying Australia is under increased threat of  terrorism due to his Government’s alliance with the Coalition of the Willing.   

 Australian Democrats Attorney General  and  Justice  spokesperson,  Senator  Brian  Greig,  says  the  Government  eagerly  joined  the  United  States  in  invading  Iraq  which  was  like  taking  a  stick  to  a   hornet’s nest.     

 “There are going to be consequences to that,” Senator Greig said.   

 “The  Government needs to be sensible in dealing with the danger we are in but  denying its’ very  existence is an unwise response.   

 “There is a fine line between alarming the public and keeping them up to date, but  when  the  most   informed members of the police and secur ity organisations in this country are telling us there is a  connection between the war in Iraq and recent terrorist attacks, then only a fool would ignore the  advice,” Senator Greig said.   

 Senator Greig says the Howard Government has a poor record of coming clean with the public over  international issues.   

 “We were mislead over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the Tampa refugee  boat and the children overboard saga.      

 “We cannot afford to make mistakes with the risk of terrorism.  If there are two competing views,  then we should assume that the highest level of threat applies and we should adopt appropriate  preventative measures,” Senator Greig said.
