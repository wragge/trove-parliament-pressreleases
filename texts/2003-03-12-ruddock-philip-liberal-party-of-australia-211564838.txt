 M e d i a  R e l e a s e  The Hon Philip Ruddock MP Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Telephone: (02) 6277 7860   and Indigenous Affairs Facsimile: (02) 6273 4144 Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation MPS 014/2003  WOOMERA IRPC TO CLOSE  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced  today  that  the  Woomera  Immigration  Reception  and  Processing  Centre  (IRPC) is to be closed next month.  There have been no boat arrivals of note since December 2001 and there are now only 77 detainees in residence at Woomera IRPC.  With  such  low  numbers  in  all  centres,  the  people  in  Woomera  can  now  easily  be  accommodated elsewhere.  The  Woomera  centre  will  be  mothballed  in  April  2003  but  will  be  maintained  as  a  contingency centre with the capacity to be put back into use at short notice.  All detainees currently in the Woomera centre will be transferred to the Baxter facility by mid-April.  The  very  successful  Woomera  Residential  Housing  Project  (RHP)  will  remain  open  and  all  residents  will  be  offered  the  opportunity  to  stay  in  the  Project  or  move  to  Baxter with their partners.  Once the Woomera IRPC closes, the Woomera RHP will be supported from Baxter IDF while discussions continue on the possibility of a new expanded RHP in the Port Augusta/Whyalla region.  The  Commonwealth  is  anxious  to  have  South  Australian  Government,  local  government  and  community  support  to  have  a  new  RHP  operating  close  to  Baxter,  as soon as possible.  Arrangements will be made for women and children in the Woomera RHP and their families and partners in the Baxter centre to be able to visit each other on a regular basis until a new project is established.  Places in the existing Woomera RHP are being offered to families in other centres to maximise utilisation of the project.  I would like to thank the Woomera community for their support of the operation at the IRPC.   It  has  been  a  mutually  beneficial  relationship  with  the  town  deriving  an  economic  benefit  while  providing  people  for  the  centre  workforce  and  allowing  the  use of the townâ€™s infrastructure.   12 March 2003  MEDIA CONTACT: Steve Ingram 0419 278 715 Portfolio information is also available on the Internet:  www.minister.immi.gov.au
