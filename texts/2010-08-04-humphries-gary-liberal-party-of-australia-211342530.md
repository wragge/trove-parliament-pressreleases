 SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES  MEDIA RELEASE  

 

 

 SCHOOL FEES WILL SKY ROCKET AS GREENS PREPARE  TO RIP $60 MILLION OUT OF CANBERRA SCHOOLS    

 The Greens want to rip up to $60 million out of funding for ACT non-government schools, driving up  school fees and taking more money out of the pockets of hard-working Canberra parents.                

 Point 65 of the Greens' education policy states that they would: “support the maintenance of the total  level of Commonwealth funding for private schools at 2003-04 levels (excluding that re-allocated  under previous clauses), indexed for inflation.”    

 “The Greens must tell us which Canberra schools will miss out under their plan and how much each  will lose."    

 Almost half of all students in the ACT are enrolled in non-government schools, and the ACT has the  highest level of non-government education in the country.     

 As school funding has increased considerably in the last 7 years, a return to 2003-04 funding levels  represents a savage cut to these schools’ funding.    

 “A $60 million slug would hurt Canberra schools and result in poorer educational outcomes,” ACT  Liberal Senator Gary Humphries said today.    

 “As a dad, I understand how important it is for kids across the capital to get the best possible  education regardless of where they go to school.    

 “Taking $60 million out of Canberra non-government schools would impact on every single one of  the 25,500 students enrolled in non-government schools here in the ACT.   

 “The Greens policy also curtails the powers of principals of non-government schools to hire staff,  select and expel students and would impose more federal control.   

 "The prospect for non-government schools of the Greens holding the balance of power in the Senate is  truly alarming.   

 “We need real action to make our excellent education system here in Canberra even better, and I am  proud of the Liberals’ education tax refund plan.   

 “The Greens must tell us which Canberra schools will miss out and how much they will lose,” Senator  Humphries concluded.

 Principles  The Australian Greens believe that: 

 1. universal access to high quality education is fundamental to Australia's prosperity,  environmental sustainability, well being and social fulfilment.  2. all people are entitled to free, well-funded and high quality, life-long public education and  training.  3. the government has a primary responsibility to fund all levels of the public education system - 

 early childhood education, schools, vocational education and training and universities - to  provide high quality education to all students.  4. federal funding to the education system (public and private) should be on the basis of equity to  ensure that all Australian children have the best opportunities to achieve the best educational 

 outcomes.  5. federal schools funding policy should prioritise the public education system to ensure that  public schools are able to provide the highest quality educational experiences and set the 

 educational standards for the nation.  6. teachers, academics, student unions and parent organisations should have a significant role in  setting directions, priorities, and curricula and in the administration of the public education 

 system.  7. the salaries and conditions of teachers, early childhood and other educators should be set at a  level that recognises the importance of their work, provides secure career structures, and 

 encourages committed and capable people into the teaching profession at all levels of the  education system.  8. teachers should have a career structure which provides opportunities for advancement and  promotion based on skills, experience and teaching specializations. Performance payments are 

 not an alternative to properly funded career path.   9. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s educational outcomes must match the rest of the  Australian population.  10. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities should determine their own educational 

 opportunities and, together with students, must be centrally involved in determining their  educational priorities and the design and delivery of education opportunities at all levels.  11. early childhood education is a critical component of lifelong learning and should be provided by  government and accredited community organizations and not-for profit providers.  12. vocational education and training (VET) should be primarily provided through the public TAFE 

 system while the community and not-for-profit VET sector should also be supported.  13. universities are places of learning and research where the needs of the whole community and the  values of service to the public and scholarship take priority over sectional and commercial 

 interests and academic freedom is protected.  14. fulltime university and TAFE students are entitled to a living allowance which enables them to  study instead of having to find paid work during teaching semesters.  15. education unions are the appropriate industrial representatives in all educational matters.

 Islander people is included in the school curriculum, and in the training and professional  development of all teachers.  44. support schools in the provision of high quality, rich information to parents and the community   and end the public ranking of schools in league tables.  45. support expert decision- making about curriculum, testing, reporting and teaching in 

 consultation with teachers, parents, students and the community.  46. ensure that public funding of private providers of VET and businesses that supply training  opportunities does not diminish the viability of public TAFE services, expertise or facilities.  47. phase out the public funding of privately provided VET where TAFE can provide the same 

 educational and training outcomes.  48. abolish all fees and charges for educational services at TAFE institutions.  49. address the over-casualisation of TAFE teaching by introducing a benchmark of 80 percent of 

 teaching by permanent staff throughout public and private VET providers.  50. increase the availability of apprenticeships, especially in rural and regional Australia.  51. ensure educators have a key role in developing and reviewing training packages.  52. provide an adequate mean-tested living allowance for full time students.  53. reject the use of education funding vouchers.  54. increase funding to the tertiary sector to provide sufficient student places to meet the demand of 

 suitably qualified applicants.  55. legislate to increase democratic participation by academics, staff, students and community  representatives in the decision-making processes within universities.  56. abolish fees for educational services at public universities for Australian students and forgive 

 HECS debts and FEE-HELP debt incurred at public universities.  57. repeal voluntary student union legislation and support the role of student unions by the universal  collection of student fees for amenities and services, by an elected student body.  58. support affirmative action entrance, residential programs and ongoing assistance to improve 

 university entrance opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.  59. increase and cost-index per-student funding of all public universities, and ensure adequate  funding to all rural, regional and outer-suburban universities.  60. support the right of academics to develop and maintain a research career and increase funding to 

 expand the research capacity of Australian universities and increase the proportion of research  funding allocated to pure research and to research for the public good.  61. end the current arrangement for recurrent funding to non-government schools by no later than  the end of 2010.  62. implement a new model for recurrent funding to non-government schools based on the 

 following: 

 - proper consideration of the resource levels of non-government schools and their financial  capacity, including fees and other parent contributions;

 - an appropriate measure for indexation of the funding of non-government schools  that de-couples it from spending on public schools; and  - non-government schools to be fully accountable to the parliament and therefore transparent  to the public on their use of government funds and their financial situation, including all 

 income and assets. 

 63. ensure that non-government schools in receipt of government funding: 

 - do not discriminate in hiring of staff or selection of students;  - have an admissions and expulsions policy similar to public schools including an obligation  to enrol; and   - demonstrate social and community engagement and benefit by offering community access to 

 facilities and/or a fee waiver for a percentage of students from disadvantaged backgrounds  and/or with special needs. 

 64. invest the money saved from ending public subsidies to the very wealthiest private schools into  a national equity funding programme for public schools.  65.  support the maintenance of the total level of Commonwealth funding for private schools at  2003-04 levels (excluding that re-allocated under previous clauses), indexed for inflation.  66. end government funding for schools that operate for private profit.
