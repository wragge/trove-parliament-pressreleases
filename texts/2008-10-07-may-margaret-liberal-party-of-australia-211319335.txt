 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 

 7 October 2008   

 Pensioners warned of email scam   

 “I have become aware that emails are still circulating claiming refugees receive welfare  payments of $2 500 per month, Federal Member for McPherson, Margaret May MP said  today.      

 “These claims are completely false and seem to originate from a similar scare campaign in  Canada.    

 “I am concerned that this scam targets older people and uses the plight of refugees to whip  up discontent.     

 “The monthly allowance figure quoted in the email bears no resemblance to the payment  provided to people in Australia’s income support system, or to payments available to  asylum seekers under the Asylum Seeker Assistance scheme.     

 “Refugees granted permanent protection visas, are permanent residents of Australia and  can access Centrelink benefits if they need them. However this is on the same basis and at  the same rates as any other Australian permanent resident.     

 “Refugees granted temporary protection visa do not have access to the full range of  Centrelink benefits. If needed they can access only Centrelink Special Benefits on the same  basis and at the same rates that apply to Australian permanent residents.     

 “I encourage anyone who receives such an email to send them straight to the trash can,  Margaret said.
