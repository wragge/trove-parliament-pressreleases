  MALICIOUS GOVERNMENT GOSSIP ON ALBANIA TRIP 
IS UNTRUE

  

  Statement regarding Malcolm Farr’s articles in   The Daily Telegraph  and   The Sunday Mail  (Brisbane) on Senator Stott Despoja’s recent 
trip to Albania: 

  

 Allegations in   The Daily Telegraph  on Saturday and repeated in   The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)  concerning Senator Stott Despoja’s 
trip to Albania are malicious and untrue.

  

 The suggestion that Senator Stott Despoja wanted to 
spend   “as much time -possibly more in Rome as she had with refugees”  
is false. She was in Rome between connecting flights (a matter of hours), 
had no intention to stay, nor had made   any  requests to do so.

  

 At no stage, did Senator Stott Despoja’s office 
say   “she was in Rome... and that there were problems getting a flight 
out of the Italian capital” . This is completely untrue.

  

 The Senator’s flights were organised through World 
Vision’s travel agent who ensured she was on the first available flight 
out of Rome [at the airport, she was met by the Australian Ambassador 
to Italy- at his request -to brief him as he was due to visit Albania 
the following week.

  

 To imply that Senator Stott Despoja misrepresented 
her visit to her Party or to the Government is unconscionable: they 
knew her whereabouts as did the Government Whip. And-- at all times- 
she has stressed that her trip was not as a representative of the Australian 
Government.

  

 Senator Stott Despoja’s understanding all along 
was that a pair was granted for Monday and Tuesday, with a requested 
contingency for Wednesday. This can be confirmed with Senator Bourne, 
to whom Mr Farr has not spoken.

  

 Senator Stott Despoja did not request an extension 
for   “another two days, effectively giving her the week off from Parliament” . 
The Senator’s office informed Senator Calvert (directly and out of 
courtesy) that she would be in the Senate first thing Thursday morning 
which she was and he informed her office her pair was available til 
Wednesday night anyway.

  

 Of all Senators absent during that week of the Senate 
due to overseas travel, Senator Stott Despoja did not possibly believe 
that her trip -- which was significant and reasonably transparent -- 
would attract such petty gossip and rumour.

  

 It is well known that Senator Stott Despoja has only 
ever missed Senate sittings for extra-ordinary circumstances (such as 
hospitalisation) and has never flouted the Senate’s rules or processes.

  

 It is always difficult to get pairs for Democrats 
(unlike for the Government or Opposition) but it was never suspected 
that other Members would seek to make political mileage out of such 
an request and that a senior member of the media would fail to consult 
the person concerned to get correct information before printing such 
an inflammatory article.

  

 The Senator will be seeking legal advice this week.
