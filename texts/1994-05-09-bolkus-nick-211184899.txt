 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM OFFERS RESETTLEMENT TO 1 3 ,0 0 0  IN 1 9 9 4 / 9 5

 Australia's commitment to the resettlement of people in urgent  need throughout the world will be maintained in 1994-95 with a  Humanitarian Program of 13,000 places, the Minister for 

 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, announced  today.

 "Australia is now the second-largest recipient of /refugee^) and  humanitarian cases after the United States," Senator Bolkus said.

 "The 1994/95 Humanitarian Program maintains the Government's  compassionate response to the continuing demand for resettlement  of people who have suffered persecution, substantial

 discrimination or displacement in their own countries."

 The Program will comprise:

 . 4000 places for refugees (people overseas who meet the

 United Nations definition of refugee) .  6500 places in the Special Assistance Category (for people in vulnerable situations overseas who have close links with  Australia) .  2500 places in the Special Humanitarian category (for people

 who have suffered discrimination or other violation of human  rights, but are not defined as refugees).

 The Humanitarian Program, like the Migration Program, is non  discriminatory and encompasses people in need from all parts of  the world.

 However Senator Bolkus said there were currently three priority  areas - Indochina, former Yugoslavia and the Middle East.

 "Over the last four years Australia has played a key role in the  Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) for the resettlement of  Vietnamese asylum seekers from camps in South East Asia and Hong  Kong," he said. "Although the CPA is to be concluded by the end 

 of 1995, just over 5, 000 Vietnamese are still in need of 

 resettlement and Australia will take a substantial number of  these in 1994/95."

 Senator Bolkus noted that the Government was particularly  concerned about women at risk, and had increased that component  of the Humanitarian Program from 400 to 500 places.

 The Minister also announced a contingency reserve of 750 places  would be created for people granted refugee status on-shore.
