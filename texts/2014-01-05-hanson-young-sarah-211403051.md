 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Sunday, 5th January 2013   

 Greens move for inquiry after government  caught lying about PNG incident   

 The Australian Greens will move to establish an independent inquiry into a violent clash at the  Manus Island detention centre in October between the special unit police force and the PNG Army,  after it was revealed that the government attempted to cover up crucial details about the incident.   

 “This government is trying to pull the wool over the Australian publics’ eyes, but this time they won’t  be fooled," the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Scott Morrison has been caught lying to the Australian public about the attack that put vulnerable  refugees and Australian staff at risk.   

 “When Parliament resumes I will move for an independent inquiry into the incident. Australians  deserve a full explanation as to what is happening in this taxpayer funded centre.   

 “It’s concerning that this operation is putting Australian workers at risk, especially now that we know  where Scott Morrison and Tony Abbott's priorities actually lie after they tried to cover up the  seriousness of this incident.   

 "This violent clash would have been terrifying for all of those involved, particularly the refugees who  were left behind confused and frightened for their lives, and my thoughts go out to them."
