 Community Calls on Vanstone to Get Kids Out of Detention -   96 children still behind razor wire   

 Community leaders and children’s groups today joined with the Labor Party to call on new  Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone to mark the beginning of Children’s Week and Refugee  Week by releasing all children from Australian detention centres.   M

 E D I A  R E L E A S E  

 

 “There are currently over 186 kids being held by Australia in detention - 96 are on Australian soil,  and the rest in Nauru,” Labor’s immigration spokesperson Nicola Roxon told a community  gathering outside Senator Vanstone’s Adelaide office today.     

 Ms Roxon said many of these children have been in detention for over two years.     

 “We call on Senator Vanstone to mark this year’s Children’s Week by getting children those into the  playground, and out of the prison yard,” Ms Roxon said.   

 “There is a consistent view across the community that all children have the right to grow up in  loving and caring environment, with the chance to play and explore - this cannot happen behind the  razor wire.     

 “Senator Vanstone should do what her predecessor Philip Ruddock could not bring himself to do  and make a decision that lets children develop in a caring, open and free environment.”   

 Ms Roxon suggested the new Minister start her job with the following actions:    

 1. Immediately release all children from detention.  2. Stop spending public money on court cases arguing to keep children behind razor wire.  3. Urgently reassess all people in detention who have been there for more than 90 days, using a  publicly accountable process.  

 4. Introduce a Green Card for all non-citizens who have work rights and implement sanctions  against businesses and employers who use illegal workers to undercut Australian wages and  conditions. 

 5. Stop dehumanising and demonising asylum seekers.  6. Boost funding to UNHCR to provide more support to countries of first asylum.  7. Close immigration processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island.  8. Introduce a special humanitarian visa category for the East Timorese.  9. Introduce a transparent, accountable and fair procedure for the exercise of Ministerial 

 discretion.  10. Take urgent action to investigate allegations about government officials promoting and  encouraging passport and travel fraud by failed asylum seekers being deported from  Australia.

 What people say about children in detention   

 "The basic philosophy of Playgroups is that children learn through play.   Learning through play in the  early years of a child's life can have a lasting impact.  All children deserve the chance to learn through  play.  Children being held in detention do not have the chance to play in a way that allows them to  fully develop - they cannot explore, experiment or experience adventure.   Australia should not take  away a child's right play."  

 Gill Murphy, Playgroups (SA) 

 

 “The committee is also aware that the minister announced an expansion of the residential housing  project in August 2002 and has recently announced the development of an RHP at Port Augusta,  which will provide alternative arrangements closer to the Baxter facility. Since the announced 

 expansion of the RHP in August last year, however, a total of only 21 women and children have been  provided with alternative arrangements. The committee is concerned at the slow rate of progress for  alternative arrangements for women and children. Despite announcements that the criteria would be  expanded for women and children who participate in alternative detention arrangements, to date the  overwhelming majority of women and children are still being housed in inappropriate detention 

 facilities.”   

 Liberal Senator Marise Payne, Chair, Human  Rights Sub-committee of Foreign Affairs Defence  and Trade.   

 

 “A detention centre is no home for a child.  Action needs to be taken to ensure the removal of children  from detention is of the highest priority.”  Dr Sev Ozdowski, Human Rights Commissioner 

 

 “Refugee children share certain universal rights with all other people, have additional rights as  children and particular rights as refugees. The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a  comprehensive framework to guide the development of policy and practices that relate to children…   

 Recommendations…   

 â¢ Families with children and unaccompanied minors should be placed in the community while  their claims are assessed…  â¢ In the event that an application for refugee status is unsuccessful and families and  unaccompanied monitors cannot return to their home country, families and unaccompanied 

 minors should continue to live in the community until such time as they can return home…   â¢ If detention centres continue to be used as a strategy for managing asylum seekers while their  claims for refugee status are assessed then these centres need to be located in major population 

 centres. This will ensure access to the range of services that are needed by children and their  families.”   Excerpt from Australian Early Childhood  Association policy statement
