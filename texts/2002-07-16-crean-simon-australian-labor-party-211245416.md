 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE - TREASURY PLACE, MELBOURNE - 16TH JULY 2002.

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Timetable for ALP Party Reform; Telstra; Sydney Airport; Iraq; Asylum Seekers and US Coastguard.

 CREAN: As you’d be aware when I took over the leadership of the Labor Party, I said I wanted to modernise the Party. Two processes were set up, one was the Hawke Wran Review that would recommend changes to the Party’s organisation. In addition we have the Policy review, which Jenny Macklin is conducting. Today I want to bring conclusion to the process associated with the Hawke Wran Review. They’ve completed their consideration of the submissions and those submissions have come from many parts of the Party and we thank all of those members that have participated so constructively in it.

 The Hawke Wran Review will be presented to the August meeting of the National Executive of the Party, which I’ve asked to be brought forward, hopefully that can be done in the early part of August. At that meeting I will be recommending that a special rules conference, to deal with the recommendations, be held in the first weekend of October, over the 5th and 6th of October, in Canberra.

 I think it’s important that we bring conclusion to this matter now. There has been widespread debate internally as it should be. But it’s important that we finalise this position and I look forward to the conference endorsing significant changes to the Party by which we can move forward. The next stage of the modernisation process of course involves the major review of our Party Policy and whilst that is going to be an important part of how we go to the next election, significant announcements have already been made by us on the policy front. Our commitment to Paid Maternity Leave, our commitment to tax cuts for working families, our commitment to protecting, fully the entitlements of workers in the case of the company becoming insolvent.

 We will continue the policy announcements over the course of the coming months, but it’s important that we develop the position, the organisational thrust by which we not only deal with our relationship with the trade union movement but also how we become a more inclusive Party, how it becomes easier to join the Party and how we open up the policy and decision making processes to a wider number of people. That will form the basis of the organisational review. That will be the basis for consideration at the special rules conference in October.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean what specific measures are you looking for out of the organisational changes apart from the 50/50 rule, which you’ve already…

 CREAN: Well, importantly I’ve signalled that we need to look at ways in which we make it easier to join the Party, in which people can participate in branch meetings more easily, to suit their time, their lifestyle. The way in which we clean up the preselection processes and stamp out the branch stackers, that is an issue which I would challenge the Liberal Party to also adopt party reform on because there have been some very interesting revelations in the course of the past couple of weeks of branch stacking in a number of Liberal Party branches. I believe that we have to have integrity in the preselection processes and one of the principles I’ve called for is that if you can’t vote in a Federal Election for a candidate you shouldn’t be able to vote in the preselection for the candidate that stands. We also need to address the appeal and disputes resolution mechanisms within the Party. These are the range of areas that I’ve identified. Many submissions have come forward in this regard to the Hawke Wran Review. We await their final recommendations and then in turn the way the Party determines to proceed with them.

 JOURNALIST: Is there a link between the branch stacking and union control?

 CREAN: No, I think that if it’s true that we’ve got to define our relationship with the trade union movement by the agenda, not the proportionality, if it’s true that we want to be more inclusive and encourage more people to join, we have to encourage them to join on an equal partnership, not a minority partnership. But it’s also true that to the extent to which people complain, whether they’re unionists or rank and filers, about the branch stackers, we have an obligation to ensure that branch stackers are not rewarded. And I’m absolutely committed to ensuring that we get rules in place that don’t reward the branch stackers. Now I’m prepared to put my authority on the line and deliver on that front. I challenge the Prime Minister to do likewise in relation to his own party where significant allegations have emerged in the last week or so about major branch stacking exercises in Queensland.

 JOURNALIST: You mentioned your authority, how much will the meeting in October be a barometer of your authority in the Party?

 CREAN: The meeting in October will be about the commitment of the Labor Party to modernise itself. If we don’t modernise ourselves we will not win. The Australian public wants a modern Labor Party for a modern Australia and I’m absolutely determined to deliver a modern, organisational, forward looking Labor Party.

 JOURNALIST: So if you don’t get the reforms you want will you stake your leadership on it, if the Labor Party can’t go forward without those reforms?

 CREAN: I will be going flat out to get the reforms that modernise the Party. I think that there’s been a lot of common sense debate involved in it. I’m convinced and encouraged by the great wealth of support that’s out there to take the Party forward. I want to lead that direction and I’m sure that the Conference will adopt a modernising agenda but of course they’ll want to see what the recommendations are, they’ll want to debate them.

 But the process is now in train, the timetable is set, we know the time frame against which we’ve got to work. What we need is common sense and direction and courage and innovation and creativity. They’re the hallmarks I’ll be taking to the October meeting.

 JOURNALIST: What else, the factions specifically, will you be trying to address them to break down the factional lines which exist now?

 CREAN: Well obviously the importance of cracking down on the branch stackers is an important part of not rewarding both branch stackers and the factional heavies. That’s why if you put rules in place to build integrity into the system that role becomes diminished. There will always be groupings within any political party, let’s not be naÃ¯ve about this or purist about it. There’s nothing wrong with organisational bases within the party structure, they’ve happened not just with the Labor Party they exist within the Liberal Party, the National Party, every political Party in the world, but what we can’t do is reward the branch stackers. That’s the key to it. What we have to do is to be a more inclusive Party so people in joining know that they’ve got a say, know that they can participate, feel they’re the part of the organisational development. That’s what I’m committed to. That’s what we’ve got to deliver to rank and filers. That’s what they’re looking for and from me that’s what I want to deliver for them.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, the Coalition Party’s saying that Telstra can’t exist in no man’s land, it needs to be sold off. What’s your opinion on this?

 CREAN: Telstra doesn’t need to be further sold off. Telstra is not in no man’s land. Telstra is an organisation that needs to deliver better

 4

 services, more affordably to the whole of Australia. The debate about the further ownership of Telstra clouds those real issues. As a nation we’ve got to be connecting ourselves a lot better. Connecting in terms of broadband technologies and opening it up so that everyone can have access to the new information age. It’s important for education, it’s important for industry, it’s important for connecting our communities. That’s the agenda that has to be driven and to flirt with the sale without addressing any of those issues is a nonsense. The other interesting thing is that the National Party are hinting that they might allow the sale if money from the proceeds goes to infrastructure. Well if they’re so keen on that why not use the dividends stream from Telstra now to support that very infrastructure? Because that dividend stream lasts forever, the sale is a one off capitalisation. And if the National Party is looking for any guidance on this, just look at the sale of Sydney Airport where the Labor Party called for part of the proceeds of Sydney Airport to be invested in infrastructure. Peter Costello said no. What makes them think the proceeds of Telstra sales are going to go to any infrastructure spending? And in particular look at the track record in terms of the so called National Heritage Trust Fund to see how that’s been underspent and misused in the past.

 The further sale of Telstra is not a solution to the nation’s needs. There are key infrastructure issues that have to be addressed but they can be addressed in different ways than selling Telstra.

 Labor remains committed to no further sale of Telstra but to looking at ways at improving affordability and access and also to creative ways by which the infrastructure needs of this country can be met.

 JOURNALIST: Would you say the sale of Sydney Airport is a bad thing now that the fares are set to go up?

 CREAN: Well I think that this is another example of what’s said before the election and before the sale and what’s said afterwards. I think it’s quite extraordinary that the Government was promising before the sale that there wouldn’t be any change in terms of the curfew and that’s in doubt, but now if they’ve given a wink and a nod that as soon as the sale goes through you can whack up the prices, why didn’t they tell the public about that before? This is just another example of the deceit of the Howard Government doing anything to get its way and doing it to the disadvantage of users and doing it in a way that does not advance sensible infrastructure spending in this country.

 JOURNALIST: Back on the Telstra sale, with Senator’s Alston’s announcement today about cracking down on telcos with fines of up to $10 million dollars, how have you reacted to that?

 CREAN: Well again this is another admission that the Government’s strategy on Telstra is failing. And what’s it got to resort to?

 5

 Penalties. Now that’s got to be just a statement that policy to date has failed. If it’s failed with the Government only owning 51% of the telco. What’s going to happen when they sell the lot, if they sell the lot? That’s why we’ve got to prevent them selling the lot. By all means improve the services. If you think sanctions and penalties are important to ensure those services are delivered have them as part of the suite of measures. But don’t try and pretend there’s some new initiative to help improve services to the bush when in fact because the Government has had its hand off the wheel, in terms of Telstra, and has been obsessed only with further selling it, not delivering better services, that’s why we’ve got the hotch potch of service delivery, the disappointment with service delivery in the bush today.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean what’s your thoughts about the CIA’s revelations that Iraq may be able to develop nuclear weapons in three years time?

 CREAN: Well that of course is an interesting report coming from the CIA. It’s something, I think, that we’ve long suspected. I think the more immediate issue though is Iraq and its position in relation to weapons of mass destruction because the weapons of mass destruction, be they chemical or biological can do harm now, not two or three years down the track. And that’s why what’s absolutely essential in terms of Iraq is that the pressure be put on to get the UN inspectors back into Baghdad, ensuring that the United Nations Resolution on weapons of mass destruction is adhered to. We can be concerned about where issues might head in the future and rightly so. But the immediate focus has to be getting that United Nations Resolution fulfilled. I had discussions last week with both the Department of Defence and with the CIA in terms of strategic briefings on these issues. There’s a realisation that the case has to be made by the US but there’s also a recognition that we have to use every effort to get Baghdad, to get Iraq complying with the United Nations Resolution. That’s the immediate task all of us have to get behind. We’ll continue to have consultations with our US allies about developments, but the initial first step has to be compliance with the United Nations Resolution on weapons of mass destruction. And in the case of any further action that needs to be taken, the case needs to be made out. We have to be on full alert in terms of developments in Iraq but there is immediacy associated with getting the UN inspectors back in.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, do you support a campaign to offer asylum seekers better living conditions?

 CREAN: I don’t know what campaign you refer to?

 JOURNALIST: Malcolm Fraser and the ACTU, they’ve been talking about how, they want to … better living conditions, better housing?

 CREAN: Look the campaign that I support is this. We need to secure our borders but we also need to deal with people that are here, in our

 6

 facilities in a more compassionate way. I don’t believe our borders are being secured as well as they might. I don’t believe enough effort has been put in to getting the international framework to stop the flow of people smugglers. I had discussions two weeks ago with Tony Blair in the UK and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees about the need to develop this international framework and I was reinforced in both of those discussions about support for that view. Far better to be stopping the boats coming from Indonesia if they are illegal by agreements with the Indonesian authorities rather than having to deal with them when they turn up on our shores.

 The other thing that I did whilst I was away is I had very extensive discussions with the US Coastguard. And it’s clear to me that we need a real cop on the beat. The navy is not equipped to do enforcement duties. Its role is defence not enforcement. The US Coastguard has an enforcement capacity, an enforcement against drug runners, against people smugglers, against illegal fishing, against quarantine. That’s the type of capacity we in Australia need to develop. I also had the opportunity to visit facilities on one of their bases and to look at their operations rooms. Now I’m absolutely convinced that if we are serious about securing our borders, Australia needs a US style Coastguard and we will continue to develop policy initiatives in that area.

 As for the question of people who get here, assuming you haven’t been able to stop properly the flow and the cop on the beat hasn’t worked then people have to be held in detention until such time as their security, their papers, their health standing is determined. They need to be processed quickly and if they’re found not to be genuine asylum seekers, returned home immediately. But Australia in terms of its humanitarian intake, if they are genuine asylum seekers, needs to be sharing the burden in relation to where there go and it needs to be treating people decently in the conditions in which they’re held. The conditions, the time of processing, they’re issues that do need to be reviewed. Detaining them when they arrive at first point is something I continue to argue very strongly in support of but protecting our borders, we can do a hell of a lot better and the current Government should be looking to international and regional solutions, not unilateral solutions. And instead of giving up our territories it should be defending them. A coastguard can defend them, conceding the island is surrendering to the people smugglers.

 ENDS.
