 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Federal Member for Tangey Promotes Harmony 

 Tuesday, 21 March 2006 

 

 Federal Member for Tangney, Dr Dennis Jensen, today marked Harmony Day by  attending Multicultural Week at Rossmoyne Senior High School.    

 “Rossmoyne Senior High is a very appropriate place to celebrate Harmony Day as  there are approximately 59 nationalities represented at the school including Holland,  Malaysia, Lithuania, Fiji, and China to name but a few,” Dr Jensen said.    

 “Harmony Day seeks to address racism in schools and in the wider community by  supporting students, staff and parents to work to promote cross cultural  understanding,” Dr Jensen said.    

 With the theme of “Whatever our differences we are all entitled to a fair go”,  Rossmoyne Senior High School’s Multicultural Week showcases the school’s cultural  diversity and its strong commitment to promoting racial tolerance in the school and  community.    

 Multicultural Week has been marked by program events at the school including a  multicultural photo competition, international food stalls, library displays, a Tai Chi  expo incorporating a fan and sword performance and students encouraged to wear  their traditional dress.    

 “I applaud Rossmoyne Senior High School and the many other school and community  groups in the Tangney electorate using Harmony Day as a way of celebrating the  diversity of cultures in our society and highlighting the need to say no to racism,” Dr  Jensen said.    

 Now in its eighth year, Harmony Day has become Australia’s most significant  multicultural event and falls on the same day as the United Nations International Day  for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.    

 “Today is a day to celebrate the many steps Australia has taken to free itself from  discrimination and racial hatred, but also a day to reflect on the challenges that remain  and to renew our commitment to overcoming them,” Dr Jensen said.    

 “Our values include respect for the rights of the individual, tolerance of differences, a  commitment to the country’s laws, the equality of men and women. The Australian 

 ‘fair go’ attitude is all about acceptance, fair play and compassion for those in need.    

 “Australia’s humanitarian program provides 6000 refugee and 7000 humanitarian  places each year, putting Australia in the top three countries (along with US and  Canada) that provide a permanent humanitarian resettlement programme,” Dr Jensen  said.
