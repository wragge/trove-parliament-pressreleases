  The Hon Peter Dutton MP  Minister for lmmigration and Border Protection 

  M E D I A  RELEASE 

  3 May 2016 

  STRENGTHENING OUR BORDERS AND BOOSTING  JOBS AND GROWTH 

  The Turnbull Government is strengthening Australia's border, while helping the  economy through more efficient border clearances of people and goods. 

  The dividends of the success of Operation Sovereign Borders in stopping the boats will  achieve further savings in this Budget, helping to strengthen our nation's finances. 

  "There has not been a successful people smuggling venture to Australia for more than  600 days. In stopping the boats we have halted the flow of illegal arrivals into detention  centres," Minister for lmmigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton said. 

  "This success will enable the Government to close four additional detention facilities,  achieving savings of $39.1 million over four years." 

  This will take the total number of detention facility closures by this Government to 17. 

  While Labor was in government they opened 17 - the result of their failure to secure  Australia's borders allowing people smugglers to send more than 50,000 illegal arrivals  into our country. 

  These closures have saved Australian taxpayers more than $500 million. 

  The additional facility closures will be staged over the next two years to retain  operational capability. Facilities to be closed are: 

  a Perth lmmigration Residential Housing 

  a Maribyrnong lmmigration Detention Centre in Melbourne  Blaxland compound at Villawood lmmigration Detention Centre in Sydney. 

  Further, the lease for the Wickham Point Alternative Place of Detention will not be  renewed beyond November 201 6.

  "The closures are part of a comprehensive long-term plan for the immigration detention  network and will occur progressively between 2016 and 2018," Mr Dutton said. 

  "The Government will continue to invest in the immigration detention network to ensure  its facilities are fit for purpose and are able to manage any potential risks to community  safety and security." 

  The Government is also committed to fostering legitimate trade and travel to further help  our economy's transition and create jobs. 

  "We will invest $69.9 million over four years to implement the Australian Trusted Trader  (ATT) program." 

  ATT is a partnership between Government and private industry aimed at enhancing  trade by improving the international competitiveness of Australian businesses. 

  Another dividend of the Government's border protection policies is the restoration of  integrity to our refugee and humanitarian program. 

  This has meant Australia can offer an additional 12,000 places to resettle people  displaced by conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 

  During 201 6-1 7 Australia will continue its generous resettlement, with 13,750 places  available in the Humanitarian Program to those most at risk. By 201 8-1 9 Australia's  Humanitarian Program will increase to 18,750 places. 

  Up to 190,000 places will be available for permanent migration in 2016-17. This will  include up to 128,550 places for skilled migration, 57,400 for family migration and 565  for migration under the Special Eligibility stream of the managed Migration Program. 

  In addition, at least 3,485 places will be provided for child category migrants outside the  managed Migration Program. This continues the transition of the child category to a fully  demand-driven model by 201 9-20 as recommended by the Interdepartmental  Committee on Intercountry Adoption in 201 4-1 5.
