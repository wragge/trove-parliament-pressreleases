  **Ã²K**Y  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Now, this is Luke Nguyen, as everyone knows, star of stage and screen and star of MasterChef  Vietnam.  

  LUKE NGUYEN: 

  Yes.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  And we were just having breakfast with two ladies, Vui a*v***,*}*v*P*U**¡*Z*}****Ã¥******]*P**(***v*Ãª**}*(**«*}*µ*Ã¥*Ãª*X*t*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª*  the audience of MasterChef in Vietnam?  

  LUKE NGUYEN: 

  Well a good-rating evening is around 20 million. 

  [Laughter]  

  PRIME MINISTER: 

  There you go eat your heart out all the Australian stars, 20 million!

  LUKE NGUYEN:  

  Yes.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  What were their names, those two young people, terrific young chefs. 

  LUKE NGUYEN: 

  Yeah. 

  PRIME MINSITER:  

  Just terrific and they, both really enthusiastic, so appreciative of Luke's mentorship and the ability of  course, to do that extraordinary fusion of east and west cuisine which we were having a taste of  there. Just tell us about the Banh Mi, the breakfast we just had?  

  LUKE NGUYEN: 

  /*Ã¶*[*Ãª*****u*µ***Z -loved Vietnamese breakfast, the Banh Mi filled with pate, butter and Vietnamese cuisine  is all about the fresh herbs as well, so I love the coriander, the pickled vegetables and the fresh mint.  That is quintessential Vietnamese dish there - texture, a bit of a French influence with the baguette  and the pate, but very light and really healthy and fresh as well.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  And quite a bit of Australian influence too.  

  LUKE NGUYEN:  

  Absolutely.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  75 per cent of the wheat that is used to make baguettes, the bread and of course noodles in  Vietnam comes from Australia.  

  LUKE NGUYEN: 

  Absolutely and I'm very proud to be in Vietnam and to be seeing that the baguette that I'm eating  has, 75 per cent of it, the wheat comes from Australia.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  d*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**Ã¥*]*P*Z*Ã¶*X*  

  LUKE NGUYEN:  

  **v******¿***v**Ã¶*Z****v*}*}***o***Ãª*U**Ã¶*Z******P*P**v*}*}***o***Ãª**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*/*[*u******Ã¶*]*v*P****Ãª**¡***o*o*U**Ã¶*Z**  wheat from Australia.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  And Luke was promoting Australian beef to our breakfast companions as well.  

  So look, the key, as I was saying last night, to securing our prosperity, is free trade and open  markets. 

  This is a rapidly growing economy. It will over the next decade or so, it will become the 20th biggest  economy in the world.  

  /*[*o*o*******u*****Ã¶*]*v*P**¡*]*Ã¶*Z**Ã¶*Z***W*Ã¥***Ãª*]*****v*Ã¶****v****Ã¶*Z***W*Ã¥*]*u***D*]*v*]*Ãª*Ã¶***Ã¥**Ãª*Z*}*Ã¥*Ã¶*o*«**Ã¶***o*l*]*v*P******}*µ*Ã¶******¿***v***]*v*P****v***  strengthening our bilateral relationship.   

  **Ãª**«*}*µ**l*v*}*¡*U**o***Ã¶***Ã¥**Ã¶*}*****«*/*[*o*o*******Ãª*]*P*v*]*v*P*****(*Ã¥**** -trade agreement with the President of Peru.

  And of course, we are down to the wire on negotiations to continue the TPP, the Trans-Pacific  Partnership with 11 countries. The United States obviously having pulled out following the change of  administration.  

  So there is a lot of progress going on, on t*Z****(*Ã¥******Ã¶*Ã¥**********v****}*Ã¢***v**u***Ã¥*l***Ã¶*Ãª**(*Ã¥*}*v*Ã¶*X*/*Ã¶*[*Ãª******Ãª*}*o*µ*Ã¶***o*«*  fundamental to our future.  

  And Luke, it's just great to be here with you - *«*}*µ*[*Ã¥****Ã¢*o***«*]*v*P**Ãª*µ***Z****v**]*u*Ã¢*}*Ã¥*Ã¶***v*Ã¶**Ã¥*}*o***X***v***>*µ*l****]*Ãª****v*  example, he is one of the 300,000 Australians of Vietnamese origin or Vietnamese background and  that is an extraordinary tie between our two countries, between this exciting, rapidly-growing  economy with so many opportunities for Australian investment and partnership and of course all of  the opportunities that creates back home in Australia. 

  So Luke, thank you for the introduction to the Banh Mi and I look forward to having another one at  one of your restaurants in Australia.  

  LUKE NGUYEN: 

  Such an honour Prime Minister, thank you very much for being here.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Thanks a lot Luke, well done.  

  So any questions?  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Is it your view that John Alexander or anyone else who finds in the coming days that they are dual  citizens, should stand down immediately and refer themselves to the High Court, or wait for the  process of declaration? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Well, look, the fundamental point is that if you are satisfied that you are not constitutionally eligible  *Ã¶*}**Ãª*]*Ã¶**]*v**Ã¶*Z***W***Ã¥*o*]***u***v*Ã¶*U**Ã¶*Z***v**«*}*µ**Ãª*Z*}*µ*o***v*Ã±*Ã¶*******Ãª*]*Ã¶*Ã¶*]*v*P**Ã¶*Z***Ã¥***X*d*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**Ã¶*Z****(*µ*v*****u***v*Ã¶***o**Ã¢*Ã¥*]*v***]*Ã¢*o***X    

  I recognise there are cases that will be line-ball decisions or questions of doubt where legal opinions  will differ and those are the cases that should be referred to the High Court.  

  After all, we referred Barnaby Joyce, Barnaby referred himself to the High Court. His legal advice, our  legal advice was that he was not disqualified - ,*]*P*Z***}*µ*Ã¥*Ã¶**Ã¶*}*}*l*******]*(*(***Ã¥***v*Ã¶**¿*]***¡*X*d*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**}*(*Ã¶***v**Z*}*¡**]*Ã¶**]*Ãª*  in the law.  

  But it's very important that the High Court has the opportunity to determine these cases. It is the  High Court and only the High Court that can determine whether somebody is qualified to sit in the  Parliament.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Has Mr Alexander updated you on his status? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  /**Z***¿***v*[*Ã¶**Ãª*Ã¢*}*l***v*U**v*}* *t  the answer is no. I understand the position is as when I last heard from him,  which is that, as you know and he has said this publicly, that he believes he is not a dual-citizen, but  he is undertaking some further enquires and seeking advice.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  The High Court is now looking at Hollie Hughes and her eligibility. Do you have any reason to think  that her appointment to the AAT may have struck her out on office of profit?  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  z***Ãª*U**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª****v*}*Ã¶*Z***Ã¥**Ã¢***Ã¥*Ã¶**}*(*^*****Ã¶*]*}*v**ï·¿*ï·¿*X*/*Ã¶*[*Ãª********}*u*]*v*P* - pardon?  

  JOURNALIST:  

  An education?  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  /*Ã¶*[*Ãª********}*u*]*v*P****v******µ*****Ã¶*]*}*v*U**¡***o*o******Ã¥*Ã¶***]*v*o*«*X*/*Ã¶*[*Ãª******Ã¥*Ã¶***]*v*o*«********}*u*]*v*P*****u***Ã¶*Ã¶***Ã¥**}*(**P*Ã¥*****Ã¶****}*v*****v*Ã¶*Ã¥***Ã¶*]*}*v*X*  

  But look, that has been referred to the full bench and I will leave it to the court to determine.  

  Once again, they are the only ones who can make these determinations.  

  JOURNALIST: 

  **u*}*v*P*Ãª*Ã¶**«*}*µ*Ã¥**u*****Ã¶*]*v*P*Ãª**Ã¶*}*****«*U**«*}*µ*[*Ã¥****u*****Ã¶*]*v*P**¡*]*Ã¶*Z**Ã¶*Z***s*]***Ã¶*v***u***Ãª***W*Ã¥***Ãª*]*****v*Ã¶*U*W*Ã¥*]*u***D*]*v*]*Ãª*Ã¶***Ã¥****Ãª**«*}*µ*  *Ãª***]***X***Ã¥****Ã¶*Z***Ã¥****Ãª*Ã¶*Ã¥***Ã¶***P*]******Ãª**¡***o*o****Ãª******}*v*}*u*]******]*Ãª***µ*Ãª*Ãª*]*}*v*Ãª**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**«*}*µ*[*Ã¥****P*}*]*v*P**Ã¶*}*******Z***¿*]*v*P*M***Ã¥*** you  looking to build more defence partners in this region?  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  We need to build a stronger partnerships and engagement right across the region in our common  quest for greater regional security. This is particularly so with counter-terrorism.  

  **Ãª**«*}*µ**l*v*}*¡*U**¡***[*¿**********v**Ã¢*Ã¥*}*¿*]***]*v*P****Ãª*Ãª*]*Ãª*Ã¶***v********v****Ãª*µ*Ã¢*Ã¢*}*Ã¥*Ã¶**Ã¶*}**Ã¶*Z****P*}*¿***Ã¥*v*u***v*Ã¶**}*(**Ã¶*Z***W*Z*]*o*]*Ã¢*Ã¢*]*v***Ãª*  recently in recent times as they *t  and are still doing so *t  as they battle an ISIL insurgency in the  *Ãª*}*µ*Ã¶*Z***Ã¥*v*W*Z*]*o*]*Ã¢*Ã¢*]*v***Ãª****v***/*[*o*o*******Ã¶***o*l*]*v*P******}*µ*Ã¶**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**¡*]*Ã¶*Z*W*Ã¥** sident Duterte when I see him in a few  days.  

  But it's very important that we work more closely together. I think that one of the natures of the  world as it is at the moment, Chris, and I made this point when I spoke at Shangri-La recently is that  we no lo*v*P***Ã¥**Z***¿****Ã¶*Z******]*Ã¢*}*o***Ã¥**¡*}*Ã¥*o****}*(**Ã¶*Z*****}*o***t***Ã¥*X*/*Ã¶*[*Ãª*****u*µ***Z**u*}*Ã¥******}*u*Ã¢*o*]*****Ã¶********v*¿*]*Ã¥*}*v*u***v*Ã¶*  ***v****]*Ã¶*Ã±*Ãª**¿***Ã¥*«**]*u*Ã¢*}*Ã¥*Ã¶***v*Ã¶**(*}*Ã¥**Ã¢***Ã¥*Ã¶*]***µ*o***Ã¥*o*«*******}*µ*v*Ã¶*Ã¥*«**}*(***µ*Ãª*Ã¶*Ã¥***o*]***[*Ãª**Ãª*]*Ã***U*****u*]*****o****Ã¥***v*l*]*v*P**v***Ã¶*]*}*v*U****  country with great authority and leadership and credibility around the world, but particularly in our  *Ã¥***P*]*}*v*U**]*Ã¶*Ã±*Ãª**¿***Ã¥*«**]*u*Ã¢*}*Ã¥*Ã¶***v*Ã¶**(*}*Ã¥**µ*Ãª**Ã¶*}**Ã¥*******Z**}*µ*Ã¶****v******v*P***P******Ãª**¡*]*****o*«****Ãª**Ã¢*}*Ãª*Ãª*]***o***U****v****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**¡*Z***Ã¶**¡***  do.

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Again, I will leave those in China to make their own conclusions.  

  Our commitment is simply to ensure that we do everything we can to maintain the regional peace  and stability that for so many decades has been the foundation of the extraordinary rise in  *Ã¢*Ã¥*}*Ãª*Ã¢***Ã¥*]*Ã¶*«**¡***[*¿****Ãª*****v**]*v**Ã¶*Z****Ã¥***P*]*}*v****v****}*(****}*µ*Ã¥*Ãª***U**Ã¢***Ã¥*Ã¶*]***µ*o***Ã¥*o*«**Z***Ã¥****]*v*s*]***Ã¶*v***u*X*  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Prime Minister, just on the TPP, is it a hope or an expectation that you will sign it today? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  These deals get done when they are done. The negotiators are continuing to negotiate. They have  made a lot of progress but the deal is not done until it is completed.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Should the deal be done on TPP- 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Just hang on a second. Yes? 

  JOURNALIST:  

  Should the TPP still be alive this time tomorrow, in which we presume it will be, will you use your  talks later this weekend with Donald Trump to urge him to rethink or do you think America's  participation is lost cause while Mr Trump remains President? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  I don't think it's a lost cause at all but I don't see President Trump taking a different approach to the  TPP any time soon. I am being realistic. 

  JOURNALIST:  

  The Japanese Commerce Minister said that there was an in principle agreement *t  is that wrong? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  I will wait until the leaders meet later today. That is when we hope to be able to reach agreements. I  *¡*}*v*[*Ã¶**(*Ã¥*}*v*Ã¶**Ã¥*µ*v**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**u*****Ã¶*]*v*P****v****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶********]*Ãª*]*}*v*X  

  JOURNALIST:  

  What will you say to Justin Trudeau about it? My understanding is he is not necessarily as  enthusiastic as you are- 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Sorry, who was that? 

  JOURNALIST:  

  Justin Trudeau.  

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Well, again, you would have to speak to the Prime Minister of Canada about that.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  **µ*Ã¶**«*}*µ**¡*]*o*o*******Ãª*Ã¢*****l*]*v*P**¡*]*Ã¶*Z**Z*]*u**Ã¶*Z*]*Ãª****(*Ã¶***Ã¥*v*}*}*v**¡*}*v*[*Ã¶**«*}*µ*M*  

  PRIME MINISTER: 

  Well, I will be and when we speak, we can perhaps talk about our views then but I haven't met with  him today yet.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Prime Minister, have you spoken to the Governor-General and given him an assurance that you can  continue to provide stable government even with the citizenship fiasco sweeping Parliament? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  I never ever comment on discussions with the Governor-'***v***Ã¥***o*X*z*}*µ*[****µ*v*****Ã¥*Ãª*Ã¶***v**  that.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Do you have a view on how many by-elections would be too many? Can you hold 10 or 12 before  you have to say we need a whole election? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  I'm not going to speculate on that.  

  The reality is, we've got to go through the process as you know. We've put out a very transparent  process where people will be able to disclose all the relevant facts and information, do so in a timely  manner, give the Parliament the time to consider it and then the Parliament will determine who  should be referred to the High Court and the High Court will make its decisions.

  PRIME MINISTER:

  JOURNALIST:  

  On Manus Island, time is running out. Is there a compromise that can be reached here? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  I would ask the people that are remaining in the Refugee Processing Centre at Manus to move to  take up the opportunity to move to fully equipped, fully resourced alternative facilities.  

  The decision to close the Manus RPC was taken by Papua New Guinea. It is after all in Papua New  Guinea. It is their country.  

  The Supreme Court recently affirmed that decision.  

  So it is very clear what the law of Papua New Guinea is saying and the people that are remaining in  the centre should move to other facilities which have got everything that they need - food, water,  security, healthcare *t  all of that is there. And comply with PNG law.  

  And I just want to say to those activists from Australia, including Nick McKim, who have been going  up there and telling these people not to move, they are encouraging them to breach the law of PNG  and they are acting in a way contrary to the interests of those refugees and other residents of the  RPC. The option is there to move to alternate, very adequate facilities and they should take that up.  

  Thank you all very much.
