 Democrats Leader stresses importance of QLD in federal election

 Queensland will be vital in the next federal election with Senator Andrew Bartlett going head to head against Pauline Hanson, Australian Democrats’ Leader Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said today.

 Addressing the Queensland Democrats’ state conference today, Senator Stott Despoja said Queensland’s tourism industry depended on good immigration and environment practices that could be undermined by One Nation’s policies.

 “On issues vital to Queensland’s tourism industry, such as immigration and environment policy, there is a chasm between the Democrats and One Nation.

 “In Queensland the tourism industry depends on the image of Australia as a friendly nation with a beautiful natural environment, particularly the Great Barrier Reef and our unique flora and fauna.”

 Senator Stott Despoja said it was appalling that neither the State Labor Government nor the Coalition Federal Government had been willing to slow the high rate of land clearing in Queensland.

 “The State and Federal Governments found around $250 million in incentives for the Comalco aluminium refinery, but they were not able to find enough money to compensate farmers and landowners in order to slow land clearing,” Senator Stott Despoja said.

 Senator Stott Despoja also said immigration policy and practices for visitors needed to send a welcome message rather than reflect a fortress mentality.

 “Tourism marketing is about perceptions. If there are perceptions overseas that Australia does not welcome people of other ethnicities and cultures, that can do a great deal of damage not just to our own social cohesion but to the overseas student market, tourism and business investment,” she said.

 “While appreciating the concerns about over-stayers and asylum seekers, we need to be responsive to the rapidly growing visitor markets from places such as Korea and China.

 “We are a country of such great multicultural diversity, yet Pauline Hanson continues to create overseas headlines suggesting Australia is considering returning to the White Australia Policy,” concluded Senator Stott Despoja.
