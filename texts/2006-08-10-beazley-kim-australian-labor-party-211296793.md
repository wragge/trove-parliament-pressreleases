 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,   10 AUGUST 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:   Immigration  Amendment  legislation; Industrial relations;   Party voting   

 BEAZLEY:  This Government’s legislation on immigration is weak and  worthless.  A weak sop in the neighbourhood.  And this is not about protecting  our borders - it’s about eliminating our borders.  And I would urge all patriotic  Liberals, Liberals with a nationalistic spirit to get in behind a bit of strength and  oppose this worthless, weak legislation.  It’s emanated from a policy of  appeasement.  Nothing ever good comes from that.   

 JOURNALIST: Passions are running pretty high.  Iron-bar seems to want to  have a go today.   

 BEAZLEY:  So I’ve noticed.   

 

 JOURNALIST: What you would be saying to the rebel Liberal MP’s with that  question?   

 BEAZLEY:  You can actually see can’t you, when you look at the  behaviour of Wilson Tuckey, the sort of bullying that those Liberals have to put  up with.  I mean Tuckey’s behaviour today here is just an example of what’s  going on inside the Liberal Party now as it falls apart on this issue.  When a  person knows what they’re doing is weak and wrong they get very cross when it’s  exposed.  When a person knows what they’re doing is weak and wrong they get  very cross when it’s opposed.     

 So, I mean Wilson Tuckey, I suppose, represents the extremity of the reaction of  the Howard supporters on this.  But the truth of the matter is: in their heart of  hearts all Australians know that legislation based on appeasement is weak.    Legislation based on appeasement is against the national interest.  And what we  should be standing for in this place is the national interest.   

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible) Kevin Andrews is not doing a very good job  (inaudible) changes?   

 BEAZLEY:  Just bringing in a couple of extra spokesmen isn’t going to  solve the problem.  The problem with this legislation is not how it’s explained.  It  is legislation which cuts wages.  It’s the legislation that’s wrong not the  explanation of the legislation.  So bringing in a few extra spokespersons to  bolster an ailing Minister is actually not the resolution of the problem.  The  resolution of the problem is to rip the legislation up.  And quite frankly, the  Australian people don’t need to know more about the legislation - they want the  legislation gone.   

 JOURNALIST: Would Joe Hockey make your job harder though, he seems  to be a bit more of a salesperson perhaps than Kevin Andrews is?  He seems to  convince people better than Kevin Andrews.   

 BEAZLEY:  The point is the public has had a $55 million campaign at its  expense run by the Government on these laws.  The Government has put huge  amounts of information about these laws out there in the public.  The public’s had  a chance to look at them and understand them and the public knows that the  laws are about cutting their wages.  They know it simply, instinctively and  accurately.     

 Now, putting in a few spokesmen who can bolster up an ailing Minister doesn’t  resolve the problem.  I suspect that what John Howard was doing with that was  trying to appease an increasingly alarmed backbench.  So this was to appease  his backbenchers that he brought in extra spokespersons.  But the backbenchers  if they’re wise, know what’s wrong here.  It’s not the way the Government  advocates it - it’s the law they’re advocating.   

 BEAZLEY:  Did you admire the Liberal moderates yesterday and  secondly does it show an element of the Liberal Party that I suppose you’ve got  the Labor Party covered and that is you can oppose the Party and not get kicked  out?   

 BEAZLEY:  The Labor Party is standing up on these laws.  We’re  standing up for the national interest.  We’re standing for border strength.  Anyone  joins us from the Liberal Party - we’re glad of that.  And we would encourage  Liberals in the House and the Senate to come on over to our side.  We’re making  a stand in the national interest.  We’re making a stand for strength.  And we hope  that Liberals will choose to join us while we make this stand.   

 JOURNALIST: If Labor wins the next election and there’s a piece of  legislation that some Members, some MP’s, Government MP’s, Labor MP’s don’t  like and they choose to cross the floor, what happens to them in the Labor Party?   

 BEAZLEY:  Sometimes we choose to have a free vote.   

 JOURNALIST: If it’s not a free vote? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  That is the way in which our rules operate.  The Labor Party  always operates collectively as a Caucus.  I might say too, we have votes in the  Caucus.  Both parties operate very differently.  In the Liberal Party they don’t  have votes.  The Prime Minister sums up what he regards as a consensus.  In  the Labor Party, you have votes.  If you don’t like a piece of legislation that is  about to go before the Parliament, you can stand up in the Labor Caucus and  demand a division and you can, technically, in fact I’ve seen it happen actually,  you can actually overthrow a frontbench or a Government position.     

 So, our tradition has been strength in the Caucus.  Liberal Party tradition has not  been that.  Liberal Party tradition has been to follow the leader.  In the Labor  Party we elect people to the frontbench and we elect people to be chairman of  committees and that sort of thing.  In the Liberal Party all that is appointment  done by the Prime Minister.  There two very different systems.  Ours has very  considerable, internal democracy - theirs doesn’t.  And they have other  mechanisms for a least dealing it a bit of dissent.  But it’s very difficult to dissent  effectively in the Liberal Party rooms.  It’s not difficult in the Labor Party.
