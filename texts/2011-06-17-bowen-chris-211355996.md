 MEDIA RELEASE

 NORTHERN TERRITORY CELEBRATES REFUGEE WEEK  2011    

 People in the Northern Territory will celebrate Australia’s humanitarian efforts and the  positive contributions refugees make to our nation during Refugee Week 2011, Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said today.   

 Mr Bowen said Refugee Week was being celebrated from June 19-25 and included World  Refugee Day on Monday (June 20), with hundreds of events to be staged throughout  Australia in recognition of the remarkable journeys made by refugees.   

 “Throughout Australia’s history refugees have added to the rich diversity of our nation and  Refugee Week is a wonderful opportunity for all Australians to recognise that contribution  and feel proud of this country’s humanitarian efforts,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “Since the end of World War II, more than 750 000 refugees and others in humanitarian  need have been resettled in Australia.   

 “We’re playing our part in providing refugees with protection, assisting others who are in  great humanitarian need and in reuniting families. The fundamentals of the humanitarian  program have served our community well and have evolved over time to respond to  changing situations across the globe.”   

 An annual cultural festival, which has become a major event on the city’s social calendar, will  be staged at Darwin’s Jingili Water Gardens tomorrow (June 18). The event is hosted by the  Melaleuca Refugee Centre and will include a citizenship ceremony for 25 people from  countries including South Africa, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Zimbabwe, India and  China.   

 From 2011-12, Australia will expand its humanitarian program by 4000 places over the next  four years - from 13 750 to 14 750 places annually - following the landmark arrangement  under the Regional Cooperation Framework.   

 The refugee program will consist of 7000 places, primarily for those referred to Australia for  resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with the  focus on refugees from the priority regions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. There will  also be 7750 places in the special humanitarian program and for people who have sought  Australia’s protection after arrival in this country and are subsequently found to be refugees.
