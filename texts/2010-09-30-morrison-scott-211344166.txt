 Government abandons failed asylum  freeze   30/09/10  

 Labor has finally been forced to agree to the Coalition's demand to lift their failed and  discriminatory assessment freeze for Afghan asylum seekers, Shadow Minister for  Productivity & Population and Shadow Minister for Immigration & Citizenship, Scott  Morrison said today.    

 “Labor's asylum freeze was nothing more than a cynical election fix that has now caused a  rolling crisis in our immigration detention network,” Mr Morrison said.    

 “The Coalition has consistently called for the lifting of the freeze including a successful  motion in the Senate this morning and a standing motion in the House of Representatives,” he  said.    

 “The number of Afghan asylum seekers held in detention has increased by almost 1,200 since  the freeze was introduced, while the number of people held in detention for more than three  months has increased from 30% to 64%,” he said.    

 “Of equal significance is the fact that since the freeze was introduced a further 58 boats have  illegally arrived.    

 “The Government's grounds for introducing the freeze in April were bogus then and remain  bogus today. The decision to lift the freeze is an admission by the Government that this was a  failed policy that should never have been introduced.     

 “The Coalition warned this policy would create a crush in our detention network and it has.    

 “The Government has no answers to the crisis they have created in our detention network.  They also have no answers to stop the unprecedented arrival of illegal boats since they  softened Australia's border protection and immigration regime that now stands at 165 and  7,879 people,” he said.
