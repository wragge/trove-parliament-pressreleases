 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 2,000 ILLEGAL ARRIVALS IN JUST 19  DAYS June 19, 2013

 The  two  illegal  boat  arrivals  announced  today,  with  a  total  of  more  than  140  people  on  board,  has  meant  over  2,000 people have arrived illegally in just 19 days this month, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “An  average  of  more  than  100  people  are  arriving  by  illegal  boat  every  day  this  month  including  people  from  Africa, demonstrating the growing global reach of Labor’s pull factors on our borders for people smugglers,” Mr Morrison said.

 “The  fact  that  12,743  people  have  arrived  so  far  this  year,  almost  three  times  the  number  that  arrived  over  the  same period last year, demonstrates both the ability and determination of people smugglers to take full advantage of every day they have under this failed Labor Government. 

 “This chaotic government cannot manage itself let alone our borders and Kevin Rudd is not the answer. Kevin Rudd is the ‘master and commander’ of border failure and the cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders. His return would only reaffirm Labor’s inability to protect our borders.

 “Kevin Rudd has never admitted he got it wrong when he abolished the Howard Government’s strong border protection  policies. Just like Julia Gillard, he doesn’t think illegal boat arrivals are a problem.

 “The Coalition has always believed in stopping the boats and will reinstate the policies that work to get it done and end Labor’s cost, chaos and failure on our borders,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “The five latest illegal boat arrivals carrying 448 people are further evidence the people smugglers are seeking to take advantage of a deeply divided and chaotic Government.

 “It is only the 19th day of June yet there have been 27 boat arrivals this month with 2,044 people on board - an average of  107 people arriving per day.

 “Labor has no plans to do anything to solve this problem they created and have completely surrendered in the face of very determined people smugglers.

 “Julia Gillard promised the Australian people that she had a plan to stop people smuggling yet over 38,000 people have arrived on her watch,” Mr Keenan said.
