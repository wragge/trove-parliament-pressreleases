 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for coming this afternoon. Iâm going to make a brief statement, then Iâll ask  George and Scott to speak very briefly, then weâll obviously take a few questions.    

 For at least a decade the Coalitionâs position has been crystal clear. Our position for at least a decade has  been - to use the memorable words of the Prime Minister - “we will determine who comes to our country  and the circumstances under which they come.” My position ever since becoming the Leader of the  Opposition is that we will stop the boats but there is a right way and a wrong way to try to stop the boats.  The right way to stop the boats is Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning boats around where it is  safe to do so. The wrong way is to cobble together in confusion and panic a one-for-five people swap which  has been proven not to work.    

 Now, as most of you know, last Friday, George and Scott and Julie Bishop and I were briefed by senior  officials of the Government and by the Solicitor-General on the Governmentâs initial proposals to amend the  Migration Act. The difficulty with the initial proposals was that it clearly stripped out the protections which  the Howard Government had explicitly built in to the Migration Act to ensure that people who were sent for  offshore processing did not lose ordinary human rights protections. Effectively, the proposals that the  Government put to us last Friday amounted to offshore dumping, not offshore processing. Now, we made  those points crystal clear to officials and to the Solicitor-General in the course of that briefing last Friday  night. So, today at midday, the Prime Minister put a different proposal, different proposed legislation to me  which I have subsequently had a chance to consider with my senior colleagues.   

 Effectively, the new proposal that the Government has put today concedes the force of our argument on  Friday evening without actually addressing it. What the Governmentâs new proposal does is pay lip service  to protections without actually guaranteeing them. Thatâs the problem with the Governmentâs new proposal.  Arguably - and Iâll ask George to speak to this in a moment - arguably the Governmentâs proposal today is  actually an inferior proposal to the one last Friday because it increases the risk of judicial review without  actually strengthening the rights protections that were entirely absent last Friday.

 Now, the Coalition has an alternative position. I will be taking to our party room tonight a proposal for  amendments which will put beyond legal doubt the ability of the Government to send people offshore for  processing, provided they are sent to countries which have acceded to the UN refugee convention. This will  restore offshore processing while also keeping protections. It will restore offshore processing while retaining  offshore protections. Itâs, in my judgement, a much superior proposal to that which the Government has put  forward.    

 You will already have or will shortly receive a note that we have from the former Solicitor-General David  Bennett who has analysed the Governmentâs proposals from Friday night and from today and the proposed  amendments that I will be taking to the party room tonight and he concludes that our proposal provides more  legal certainty and more rights protections than either of the Government proposals. In effect, our proposal is  a win-win:  certainty plus protections, offshore processing plus protections, whereas the Governmentâs  proposals, particularly todayâs, are a lose-lose: doubt as to whether anything the Government does can  survive legal scrutiny, while not guaranteeing offshore protections. So, this is whatâs happening. Obviously  Iâll have more to report this evening in the wake of the party room discussion but I might now ask first  George and then Scott to say a few words.   

 GEORGE BRANDIS:   

 Well thank you, Tony. Youâve just had distributed to you Dr Bennettâs advice. If I can take you through it  youâll see that it annexes under Schedule 1 the two versions that the Government has put to us, version one  being the Friday night version and version two being the version given to Mr Abbott at lunch time today and  then as Schedule 2, the draft amendments that we will be taking to our party room at 6.30 tonight.   

 Can I direct you, in particular, to the final paragraph of Dr Bennettâs advice, paragraph 3.2 which speaks to  the Coalitionâs proposed amendments and which speaks for itself. Can I just very briefly expand on the point  of the inferiority of the version put to Mr Abbott by the Prime Minister at lunch time today. Might I remind  you that the reason the High Court struck down Minister Bowenâs declaration with Malaysia was because it  was not objectively satisfied that the four criteria set out in section 198 A (3) of the current Migration Act  were able to be satisfied and in approaching the matter in that way the Court applied a legal principle known  to lawyers as âjurisdictional errorâ. If the facts werenât there, there was no jurisdiction to make the  declaration.    

 The way, therefore, in order to remove any legal doubt is to ensure that amendments to the Act are drafted in  a way which does not make the Ministerâs declaration depend upon contestable facts. What the Prime  Minister, in the version that she produced to Mr Abbott at lunchtime today has done, has actually been to  reintroduce into the matters about which the Minister needs to be satisfied a number of criteria that are  arguably contestable facts and that is why it seems to us that the version is, if anything, weaker than the  version that was given to us on Friday evening. The way to do this, therefore, is to ensure that there is the  appropriate protections, but that the protections do not depend upon contestable facts and the way that youâll  see in Schedule 2, the Opposition proposes we go about this, is to leave the Ministerâs discretion wide and  indeed unreviewable but subject to one important limitation: that is, that it is only exercisable in relation to a  country which is a party to the UN refugee convention. Whether or not a country is a party to the UN  refugee convention is not a contestable fact, itâs a black and white question and therefore the legal problems  which beset the existing section 198A and which, in our view, would potentially beset what was produced  today by the Prime Minister to Mr Abbott would not arise.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks George. Scott?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:

 Thank you Tony, thank you George. What the Prime Minister needs is not a blank cheque from the  parliament, they need a decent policy and thatâs the problem. This Government has had a series of policy  failures in this area, starting with their decision to abolish the Howard Governmentâs border protection  regime three years ago - 12,000 people, 241 boats later, this is the mess weâre in from the Governmentâs  own design. Whether it was the failure to handle the Oceanic Viking crisis, whether it was the failed Afghan  asylum freeze, whether it was the failed East Timor policy and now the failed Malaysian Solution, the Prime  Minister wants a legal blank cheque for more policy failures. Well, what I think the Leader today and the  Shadow Attorney-General have made very clear is that we can secure offshore processing. In fact, the  Solicitor-Generalâs own opinion, as he said very clearly to us last Friday, does not rule out going to Nauru  but the measures weâve put forward today further strengthen both the processing and the protections but it  also provides the opportunity for this Government to return to good policy: the policies that Tony Abbott has  outlined today, the policies that are designed to stop the boats, that have stopped the boats and will stop the  boats and that remains our policy objective.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks Scott. Ok, are there any questions?    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, obviously the  impact of your amendment would be to rule out Malaysia, thatâs not a signatory  to the convention. If this develops into a stand-off and the Government persists and puts its bill to the test,  how will you respond to the part that deals with unaccompanied minors? Would you want see that split and  pass that or are you prepared to vote the whole lot down if the Government persists with a single the bill?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, weâve got an alternative proposal to the Governmentâs. We think our alternative proposal is a better  proposal all round. I would like to think that just as Iâve considered the Governmentâs proposal, the  Government will now consider our proposal.   

 QUESTION:   

 What if itâs rejected, though?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, letâs cross that bridge if and when we come to it.   

 QUESTION:   

 What is your response to the Prime Ministerâs often made appeal to you that the Government, executive  government, should have the right to deal with, well, this issue as it sees fit? Donât you recognise that right  for her?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I donât believe itâs the Oppositionâs duty to provide a blank cheque to a bad government and I think  any suggestion that the Opposition should write this Government a blank cheque is it doesnât pass the  common sense test. Our responsibility is to good policy, our responsibility is not to support bad policy and  weâve said all along that we think the one-for-five Malaysian people swap is a bad deal and the fact that the  boats have kept coming - notwithstanding the fact that this has now been in the public arena for quite some  time - demonstrates that it isnât good policy.

 QUESTION:   

 On turning back the boats, and I think that was done six or seven times under the Howard Government, the  last time was about 2003. Now, it wasnât pursued, one because the Defence Force didnât want to do it  anymore, secondly because boats were routinely sabotaged and now weâve got a third problem with that  proposition because the Indonesians wonât accept it because there is no nod-and-a-wink agreement at an  agency level. So, how do you propose to pursue a policy which looks unworkable?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I donât think we can safely adopt that conclusion. It hasnât been tried. It just hasnât been tried. Now, I  think that what could have been managed by the Howard Government under the then Indonesian leadership  is more than capable of being matched by a future Coalition government with the current Indonesian  leadership. The current Indonesian leadership is pretty well disposed towards Australia and I think if these  things were done without the kind of hairy-chested megaphone diplomacy that we saw from Kevin Rudd at  the time of the Oceanic Viking, thereâs no reason why it canât work.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, you are effectively conceding that you would need some arrangement, whether it be government-to-government or agency-to-agency. In the Howard Government time there was an agreement between the  agencies, a tacit agreement albeit, regarding turning back the boats. Is that what youâll need?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, you always have to have - as part of effective operations against people smuggling - constructive  relations with Indonesia. I see no reason why we canât have better relations with Indonesia than the current  Government has and I donât see why the kind of arrangements which previously allowed boats to be turned  around under the right circumstances canât be put back in place.    

 QUESTION:   

 Why are you so determined to insist on the recipient country being a UN convention-signing country when  in government you didnât insist on that at all? Isnât this just a political point youâre making against the  Government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I think it is very important to note that the Howard Government explicitly put human rights  protections into the Migration Act as part of the establishment of offshore processing. The Howard  Government - let me make it crystal clear - explicitly put human rights protections into arrangements for  offshore processing.   

 QUESTION:   

 They havenât been taken out. Theyâre still there.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, indeed, they have been taken out. They have been taken out by this Governmentâs proposal. I mean,  the whole point of this Governmentâs proposal is to explicitly remove from the Migration Act the human  rights protections that the Howard Government thought should be there. So, people who for years pilloried  the Howard Government as heartless and brutal are now proposing to remove even those protections that the  Howard Government thought were necessary. Now, the best way, we think, to ensure that the Minister can 

 5 

 

 make these decisions without exposure to judicial interference, if thatâs the right word, while at the same  time guaranteeing human rights protections, is to put the UN convention requirement in there. We think this  is the best way of having certainty and protection and thatâs what we want to secure.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, just on the UN protection, Indonesiaâs not a signatory. So are you, by insisting on this  amendment disqualifying your own tow-back policy? Are you going to return people to a country thatâs not  a signatory but insist the Government canât do the same?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well the point I make is that our obligations are not triggered at that point in time. They are triggered once  people have made landfall in Christmas Island.   

 QUESTION:   

 Can we come back to Philâs earlier question about the children? If you had your Nauru solution by itself  wouldnât there still be a problem with moving the children, under the High Court ruling?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, Michelle, letâs wait and see what the Government does. Letâs wait and see how the Government  responds to our proposal.   

 QUESTION:   

 But your amendments donât go to that, Mr Abbott.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, Andrew, as I said, the Government has put a series of proposals to us. It put one set of proposals to us  on Friday. Itâs put a different set of proposals to us today. We have done our best to consider these matters  in good faith. We are responding in good faith, now letâs wait and see. But I do make this very fundamental  point that processing in Nauru avoids the sorts of difficulties that processing in Malaysia inevitably will  entail.   

 QUESTION:   

 Why doesnât your amendment have not just the refugee convention but also the UN conventions for the  rights of children?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, Hugh, as I said weâre putting a counter proposal to that of the Government. Let the Government deal  with the proposal that we are putting forward.   

 QUESTION:   

 If itâs accepted by the Government donât you still have a problem with children?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the fact of the matter is that we are putting, Michelle - and we are going around and around in circles 

 6 

 

 here, so Iâm going to ask for another question on another subject - but I want to make it crystal clear that we  are putting a counter proposal to the Governmentâs proposal that we think restores certainty while  maintaining protections and I think that is what a responsible opposition in these circumstances does.   

 QUESTION:   

 You say that the changes that the Governmentâs proposing would remove the protections put in under the  Howard Government but as late as this morning Scott Morrison was saying that you think that your policy is  already legal under what exists now. So, surely then, by agreeing to some of the Governmentâs changes but  insisting on inserting the UN convention clause all youâre doing is making sure the Malaysian deal is ruled  out. So, surely this change is not necessary under what youâve been saying this morning and itâs only  designed to ruin the Governmentâs policy?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, let me make it crystal clear if I can that we donât believe that - as the High Court decided the other  week - Nauru is ruled out and indeed the Solicitor-General on Friday confirmed that Nauru was still a viable  option under the High Courtâs decision. What we do want to do, though, is as far as is reasonable put these  things beyond legal dispute and thatâs why we have put forward an alternative, an alternative which is not  open to the kind of legal disputation which the Governmentâs says is now inevitable under the High Courtâs  decision. Now, because youâve raised Scott, Scott do you have any response that you wish to make?   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Sure. I mean, I have always said that the position of the High Court never ruled out us taking people to  Nauru and that was confirmed to us last Friday. Iâve also said we were prepared to look at provisions which  strengthen the Migration Act. Those two positions are not inconsistent with each other and that is exactly  what we are doing here. This bill as weâre proposing it as amended would certainly strengthen the Migration  Act and certainly strengthen offshore processing.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, do you have concerns then about Nauru being challenged? I mean, you say that your policy is legal and  it couldnât be challenged but at the same time you are agreeing to changes…   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 No, what I said was the High Court did not rule out Nauru as an option and it never has and the Solicitor-General has also formed that view. It doesnât rule it out. He has never said that and thatâs all weâve ever  said.   

 QUESTION:   

 So why donât you just leave in place whatâs in the Act now if you think that that would shore up your  policy?   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Weâre happy to improve legislation where legislation can be improved. What weâre trying to do here is  improve legislation and weâve put forward an option to the Government and weâll wait and see what they  say.   

 QUESTION:   

 7 

 

 Did you communicate your position to the Prime Minister during your meeting earlier, that is tell her that  you couldnât support her proposal and that you had a counter proposal?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I indicated to the Prime Minister in our discussions earlier today that I had very grave reservations about the  proposal that sheâd put to us on Friday; that the Coalition had a disposition to give the proposal a second  reading but then to move amendments in the committee stage. It was at that point that she came up with this  new proposal and, as I said, our reaction to the new proposal - now that weâve had time to look at it - is that  in fact it is inferior to the original proposal in that it is more open to legal challenge and doesnât actually  give any additional protections.   

 QUESTION:   

 Given that you want to protect human rights and so on, do you have a timetable for getting up your  amendments and finishing off [inaudible] problems with the migration law? Do you want to see it signed  and delivered by the end of the year?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, itâs really up to the Government to determine how quickly things are handled in the parliament and I  want to make it, again if I can, crystal clear why we are in this position. We are in this position because the  current Government closed down the Pacific Solution and the current Government gave the people  smugglers a business model. Since the current Government gave the people smugglers a business model  weâve had 240 boats and 12,000 illegal arrivals. The current Government is responsible for the existing  position. The current Government is responsible for handling it. Now, we are responding in good faith to  proposals that have been put to us by the Government. We have come up with what we think is a better  position and itâs now up to the Government to handle it as best it can.   

 Thank you.
