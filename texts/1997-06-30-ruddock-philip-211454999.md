  and linguistically diverse society. The Council will: 

  1. Develop a report to the Minister which recommends on a policy and implementation framework for  the next decade, that is aimed at ensuring that cultural diversity is a unifying force for Australia. 

  The report should: 

  -articulate the guiding principles and unifying values that underpin the policy; and  -identify elements of a policy framework and implementation strategy (including any impediments in  the current policy framework and nomenclature) which will contribute to: 

  : broad community support for, and understanding of, these principles and values; and : enhancing  national unity through acceptance by Australians of both the diversity and the common structures of  Australia. 

  2. Consider and provide advice to the Minister on the policy implications of Australia's linguistic and  cultural diversity in significant forthcoming events including the Centenary of Federation and the  Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. 

  3. Provide advice and report on other specific matters referred to it by the Minister. 

  In carrying out its work the Council will: 

  â‘ take account of the Joint Parliamentary Statement of 30 October 1996 that: 

  "this House: 

  -reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with  equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin.  -reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non-discriminatory on  grounds of race, colour creed or origin.  -reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage.  -reaffirms its commitment to maintain Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society,  united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values.  -denounces racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to  be." 

  â‘ take account of the context emerging from wider Government directions, priorities and policies ,  including commitments to: 

  -seek a socially cohesive, tolerant and harmonious nation united by common values, goals and  aspirations; 

  -advance the interests of the wider community, and hence the national interest, as distinct from the  special interests of sectional groups; 

  -individual choice and responsibility as integral to public policy-making in Australia; -fair, open and  competitive markets that support both economic and social needs; and -work with community groups  to develop the great strengths which derive from the diversity of languages and cultures in Australian  society, and to reaffirm the strength of the unifying values that Australians share. 

  â‘ note that the values/principles underpinning current multicultural policy as articulated in the 1989  National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia retain their importance; 

  The Council may wish to consider the application of those values/principles in the context of  changing circumstances. It is noted that a great deal has been achieved under policies and programs  that have been built on those values/principles. These policies and programs include access and  equity, anti-racism education, English language services, settlement services and those relating to the  benefits of cultural and linguistic diversity. The challenge is to ensure that policies adapt to meet new  or changing priorities, without jeopardising existing achievements. The application of those

  r97066 http://www.immi .gov.au/minrel/r97066.htm 

  values/principles should aim to consolidate these achievements, but should not be constrained by the  perspectives of previous policy. 

  â‘ take account of recent reports that deal with cultural diversity issues, including the 1995 National  Multicultural Advisory Council report Multicultural Australia: the Next Steps, Towards and Beyond  2000; 

  â‘ engage the community in discussion, particularly at the local community level, to ensure effective  input to policy development and a better understanding by Australians of how diversity within a  common structure can enhance national unity; and 

  â‘ keep the Minister informed of progress, particularly in relation to any major developments.
