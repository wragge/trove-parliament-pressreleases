 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 25 July 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MR. GEORGE CHRISTENSEN MHR,  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR DAWSON   AND LIBBY EDGE, DIRECTOR OF ECO BARGE SERVICES  

 SHUTE HARBOUR, QUEENSLAND 

 

 Subject: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; Labor’s Malaysian people swap; tourism industry.    

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s great to be here in the Whitsundays. I want to thank Eco Barge and all the volunteers led by Libby, who  has done such a great job to clean up our marine environment here. For me, it was really stunning to see just  how much rubbish there was on beaches that to the naked eye at first glance look pretty pristine and it’s  really important that we encourage people like Libby. The Edge family have done a fantastic job here and I  think that it’s just great that Libby is building on the work that the Edge family has been doing for years for  the marine environment.    

 I think that the Government has neglected direct action on the environment ever since the current  government started talking about emissions trading schemes and carbon taxes. Real action to help the  environment has been lacking. One of the policies that I’m particularly committed to is the Green Army  which is about deploying 15,000 people into environmental hotspots like this to provide the hands-on,  practical environmental assistance that appropriate land care for Australia really needs. The Green Army  would certainly be available to supplement the work of Libby Edge and her volunteers cleaning up this part  of our coastline.    

 Just a couple of other issues that I want to mention before I ask Libby to say a few words and then I’ll ask  your local member, George Christensen, to say a few words and it’s also good to be with Senator Ian  Macdonald, the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Northern Australia.    

 Really, we’ve had a very, very significant development today with the publication of Julia Gillard’s secret  inner Cabinet memo about climate change policy where she said that the Government should adopt the  direct action policies of the Coalition. That was the real Julia speaking then. What we’ve got now is fake  Julia and the real Bob Brown. The policy that the Government is pursuing now is fake Julia and the real Bob  Brown as opposed to the real Julia, who thought that the way to best achieve our five per cent emissions  reduction target was through the Coalition’s direct action.    

 Finally, let me just say this Malaysian deal is another betrayal by the Prime Minister. She said adamantly  that there would be no boat people sent to countries that haven’t signed the refugee convention. Malaysia

 hasn’t signed the refugee convention. It has no intention of signing the refugee convention. Now, boat  people are going there. If the Howard Government had done something like this, every human rights activist  in the country would be in uproar and now a Labor government which has previously denounced as  inhumane the kind of policies that the Howard Government put in place is doing something far, far more  brutal and I think it’s a broken promise, it may not work but at the end of the day, this government is  sending boat people to a country where they may well face caning.    

 Let’s hear from Libby and then from George and then we’ll throw to some questions. Libby?    

 LIBBY EDGE:    

 Eco Barge Services is a constant marine debris removal programme that we’ve put in place for the  Whitsunday Islands, first off to protect our precious marine life that live around our islands but also having  our beaches cleaned from marine debris and then monitored. It helps our tourism industry and we have 280  volunteers, local volunteers, ready to go on our barge to go out and directly remove marine debris.    

 This is also education awareness for our local community and a wonderful way for them to go out and see  our islands and also give something back to those islands that give us so much in return. So, what we  desperately need is funding to keep this programme running for our islands and let the community be a part  of it. So, it was wonderful to have Tony on today so he can see what marine debris is and how much it is  impacting on our marine environment. It’s a relatively new problem, since we’ve made plastics, plastic  companies don’t need to own that plastic product once they sell it on and it’s actually ending up in our  marine environment, in the storm water systems, and flushes out to sea. If Tony can come onboard and  support us by protecting our island, which is Australia, from dumping our rubbish into the ocean, protecting  our islands, our marine life, that would be a wonderful solution.    

 The Whitsunday Islands are iconic and they’re stunning, they’re beautiful. Whitehaven Beach is magical.  Any tourist that goes out there, they’re spellbound by its beauty but the beaches that collect the marine  debris, tourists aren’t going to. They’re open to the south-east facing winds so it’s a little bit rough and that’s  why it’s collecting rubbish. We want to go collect that rubbish on those beaches and then that limits the  marine debris going off to Townsville, Cairns and all up the Great Barrier Reef. So, we’re protecting our  iconic islands and the iconic Great Barrier Reef’s marine life from eating our garbage, really.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok. George, why don’t you say something, mate?   

 GEORGE CHRISTENSEN:   

 Well, look it’s fantastic to have Tony come and jump on Eco Barge with Libby and myself and all the other  volunteers. They do a fantastic, practical, environmental job here in the Whitsundays that no one else is  doing and I think that the job that Eco Barge and Libby and her volunteers are doing fits in nicely with the  Coalition’s direct action on the environment policy and I’m sure that when we’re in government we’ll be  looking at programmes such as this to provide assistance to. This is a way of delivering real results for the  environment instead of talking about a tax which is just not going to help anyone. It’s not going to clean up  the reef here, it’s not going to do anything for anyone. These people are doing the real work and we need to  get in and support them.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well said, George. Any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 3 

 

 Yeah Tony, the polls have gone slightly up for Julia and they have signed a deal which was a long time  coming but they’ve got one. So, is this a positive sign for the Government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I really hope that the Prime Minister keeps wearing out the shoe leather on the carbon tax because the  more people find out about the carbon tax the less they like it. As Paul Keating famously said, “if you don’t  understand it, don’t vote for it. If you do understand, you’d never vote for it” and, as I said, where I go  people hate this tax with a passion. It’s toxic. They know it’s bad for jobs, they know it’s bad for our  international competitiveness and, most of all, they know it’s terrible for our cost of living which is just  going up and up and up.   

 QUESTION:   

 Tony, just on another issue, Mary Jo Fisher’s having some hard times. Are you standing by her?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Of course I am, of course I am. Look, she’s a great contributor. I think she has an enormous amount to  contribute. Yes, there are some issues at the moment that she’s grappling with but we know from Andrew  Robb’s experience that people can come back from these kinds of problems and be real contributors and the  last thing we should do is get judgmental about people who are suffering from the kind of issues which  about 20 per cent of the Australian public suffer from in any one year.   

 QUESTION:   

 You’re also here to meet with tourism operators in the region. What’s the reason for that meeting and how  important is it for you to meet with local operators?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, tourism is a very important part of the north Queensland economy. It’s particularly important to the  Whitsundays, very important to Cairns. Obviously, Mackay and Townsville have a lot of other industries as  well, but those centres need tourism as well. After coal mining, tourism is probably at least as important as  any sector to the Queensland economy and I want to get the view of the tourism industry here about their  problems. Now, I suspect that one of the things they’re going to tell me is that confidence is way down and  one of the best things that the Government could do for confidence would be to say tomorrow that they’re  going to drop the carbon tax because the carbon tax will impact on tourism. A study has been done for the  tourism industry which suggests that the carbon tax at $25 a tonne will reduce tourism employment by up to  6,500. It will drop the number of international visitors by almost 140,000 and add almost $900 million a  year to tourism industry costs. Now, this is very significant on top of all the other difficulties that the  tourism industry has. The last thing they need is this carbon tax.   

 QUESTION:   

 And there’s also an issue locally - George would know a fair bit about this - one of the issues about getting  visitors here is the lack of flights coming into the region. If you were to get in government, and George, is  there any ways that you think this could be fixed?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, again, drop the carbon tax because the carbon tax will apply without any concessions or rebates to  aviation fuel and if we want to encourage aviation, we better drop this tax. The major airlines are already  pointing out just what a big hit this will be on their bottom lines. At least some of them are saying that 

 4 

 

 they’re going to have to look again at rationalising services. So, the best thing you can do for trying to  ensure that we get more flights into places like the Whitsundays is to drop the carbon tax. Our economy,  except for parts of the mining sector, is in the doldrums at best. Tourism has been doing it tough for several  years now. The last thing we want to do is make a difficult situation worse with this big new tax on  everything because power and transport are embedded in the price of everything. That’s why this big new  tax is so destructive to the whole Australian economy.   

 GEORGE CHRISTENSEN:   

 Tony is absolutely right on that front. Some of these big airlines have indicated that they could rationalise,  they could look at certain routes that they don’t go on and, you know, given that we have got Hamilton  Island competing with Whitsunday Coast airport, that is a real issue for the Whitsundays. So, I am  personally writing to Qantas and Virgin Blue and Jetstar to find out whether there is any rationalisation of  Whitsunday Coast Airport. That would be a drastic thing for this region under the carbon tax.   

 QUESTION:    

 I know you were saying a fair bit about the carbon tax having an influence on visitors here. Over the last few  years, the tourism numbers have dropped in this region. So, do you think there are other issues apart from  the carbon tax?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, there are lots of other issues, but the carbon tax is plainly having an enormous impact on confidence  right now. I mean, confidence has suffered the biggest drop almost in the history of the recordings over the  last couple of months, particularly since the Prime Minister announced the carbon tax package. Now, as I  said, the best thing that a government can do to restore confidence is avoid new policies that are going to  make a difficult situation worse.   

 Thanks so much.
