 LABOR’S BUDGET BLACK HOLE JUST KEEPS EXPANDING   

 Tonight in his Budget Reply Speech Bill Shorten must explain how his push for higher taxes  is not going to hurt jobs and growth in our transitioning economy.    

 All Bill Shorten as a former Rudd and Gillard man seems to be offering is more unnecessary  political change and higher taxes.   

 Tonight he must explain to the Australian people how he is proposing to pay for his many  unfunded spending promises.   

 This comes at a time when we again received confirmation that Labor does not know how to  add up, with revelations this week of a $20 billion black hole in its costings of the proposal to  increase the tobacco excise.    

 Today we can confirm that Labor's total budget black hole now stands at more than $62  billion. That is, under Labor the 2016-17 budget would be more than $62 billion worse off  over the forward estimates.   

 This is made up of savings and revenue measures proposed by the Government which Labor  are opposing, spending Labor says we must restore from banked savings and the budget  impact of Labor’s own spending proposals so far.    

 Tha  t is why tonight Bill Shorten needs to answer these critical questions:     

 1. Does he stand by all the spending promises he and his Shadow Ministers have made  so far? If not, that is if Labor has changed its mind on any of them he needs to tell the  Austra 

 lian people.  

 

 2. How  is Bill Shorten going to pay for his unfunded spending promises?   

 3. Is he going to pay for them with higher taxes which hurt jobs and growth?   

 4. Is he going to pay for them with bigger deficits and debt - which will lead to higher  taxes over time which hurt jobs and growth?  

 

 

 

 5. Or , is he going to do what the Government has done and that is to pay for any  increased spending with genuine savings, genuine spending reductions, in other parts  of 

  the Budget and if so where?   

 The Government on Tuesday laid out our plan for jobs and growth, including our efforts to  put the budget on a sustainable foundation for the future.   

 Will Bill Shorten tonight again confirm his tax, spend and borrow approach which would hurt  jobs and growth and undermine our economic transition from resource investment driven  growth to a stronger, more innovative and diversified economy? Or will he join the  Government in support of our agenda for jobs and growth and to secure our successful  transition to a stronger more diversified economy?

  Restoration of Labor's preferred timetable to increase superannuation guarantee rate to 12 per cent  ($6.73 billion)  Source: Shorten, interview with Patricia Karvelas: RN Drive ABC Radio: 18 March 2015- “See one  way to take pressure off the Age Pension isn’t by cutting the pension, it’s by ensuring that over time,  over the long run by increasing superannuation 12 per cent as Labor would do, then you’ve got  people who will have less reliance on the pension.”   

 20) Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development has committed Labor to  spe  nd more on foreign aid (overturning the Government’s decisions in the 2014-15 Budget  and 2014-

 15 MYEFO) ($19.27 billion)  Source: Tanya Plibersek, ABC Radio Newcastle Interview, 30 July 2015- when asked “What would  Labor do if re-elected next year?“ Plibersek: “Well we certainly wouldn’t continue with the aid cuts  that are scheduled by this Government.”

  ore the last election.”   

 23) Pausing indexation of Local Government Financial Assistance Grants for three years ($1.32  billion)  Source: Julie Collins, Speech to the Local Government Association, 17 June 2014 - “‘I am extremely  disappointed the Abbott Government decided to freeze the indexation of the Financial Assistance  Grants … The Abbott Government decision to freeze the indexation of the Financial Assistance  Grants is a clear demonstration of the Government’s wrong priorities … I know many of you are  speaking out against this decision and will so over the next few days, and I encourage you to  continue”   

 24) Efficiencies resulting from the rationalisation of Indigenous programmes, grants and activities  ($315 million)  Sourc 

 e: Bill Shorten, Media release, 14 May 2014 - “Tony Abbott’s claim to be a ‘Prime Minister for  I  ndigenous Affairs’ has been exposed as a hollow platitude. His budget of broken promises has gutted  more than $500 million from programs that support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  No true Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs would be so heartless about one of the most important  policy challenges facing our Parliament.”   

 25) Changes to Industry Skills Programmes ($271 million)  Source: Sharon Bird, Hansard, 1 October 2014 - "Finally, the report indicated that we needed to get  seriously into the business of guaranteeing a supply of capable apprentices.

 26) Changes to Industry Support programmes ($502 million)  Sourc  e: Kim Carr, Senate Hansard, 17 November 2014 - "The unending cycle of reviews does not do 

 anything other than add to the uncertainty and the government's cover, when in reality there is an  unmitigated hostility: the destruction of Commercialisation Australia, of Enterprise Connect, of the  Innovation Investment Fund and of the Australian Industry Participation Plan, and the attempts to  destroy the TCF support program—the list goes on and on and on."   

 27) Reducing Landcare uncommitted funding for future grant rounds ($644 million)  Sourc  e: Joel Fitzgibbon, House Hansard, 15 May 2014 - “One of the less-publicised details was the 

 $480 million cut to Landcare. This cut is a very bad mistake … This ill-conceived budget decision is a  bad mistake and, for the sake of our farmers, our economy and the environment, it should be  reversed.”   

 28) Replacing Tools For Your Trade with Trade Support Loans ($560 million)  Sourc  e: Sharon Bird, Media Release, 14 November 2014 - "Instead of investing in jobs for the future 

 and skilling up our existing workforce, the Abbott Government has ripped almost $2 billion from the  skills portfolio by axing the... Tools for Your Trade Program"   

 29) ABC funding changes ($277 million)  Sourc  e: Bill Shorten, Doorstop, 25 November 2014 - “I can certainly give the commitment that under 

 Labor, we will increase the funding of the ABC.”   

 30) Savings from research funding (CSIRO, ANSTO and Australian Institute of Marine Science) ($76  million)  Source: Chris Bowen, ABC AM, 26 November 2014 - "Now when you look at what they're doing in  t

  otally in research and development, whether it's the $113 million cut to the CSIRO, whether it's the  abolition of many commercialisation and innovation organisations - effectively the halving of  innovation and commercialisation funding when it goes to the allocation of those organisations -  they're fundamentally bad changes, dumb changes."   

 31) Reducing uncommitted funding for arts programmes ($108 million)  Sourc  e: Mark Dreyfus, Media release, 14 May 2014 - “The worst fears of the arts community have 

 been confirmed in last night’s Budget, as more than $100 million has been slashed from the Arts  budget... These funding cuts will have a devastating impact on all arts and cultural activities right  across Australia... Labor believes the arts are a vital part of Australia as a nation, and are worth oy  government support.”   

 32) Terminating the Australia Network contract with the ABC ($99 million)  Sourc  e: Plibersek/Clare, Media Release, 14 May 2014 - “Tony Abbott’s $200 million Budget cut to 

 the ABC’s Australia Network is a clear broken promise.  The ABC was funded to run the Australia  Network…The Australia Network is a vital public diplomacy tool that reaches up to 167 million  households, giving Asia and the world an insight into Australian life and values. Yesterday, Tony  Abbott ripped the ABC contract to shreds and abolished the network.”

 Source: David Feeney, Media release, 14 May 2014 - “The Abbott Government has unleashed a  Budget   of twisted priorities with $11.7 million aced from the Australian Federal Police... To make 

 matters worse, the Abbott Government has cancelled $42.5 million of funding allocated by the former  Labor Government for additional sworn officers. The Abbott government’s Budget of broken promises  will compromise Australia’s national security and capacity to tackle organised and transnational  crime, high tech crime, drug trafficking, major fraud, money laundering and terrorism.”

 Source: Shorten and Macklin Press Conference, 16 June 2015 - “We’re here today to talk about  Labor’s determination to defend pensioners against Mr Abbott and the changes he’s proposing and  the cuts he’s inflicting... The Liberal Party has proposed that 330,000 pensions either lose all or part  of their pension. But furthermore, the changes which Mr Abbott’s proposing to the pension will mean  that another 700,000 people now working in their 50s and early 60s will face cuts to their pension.  The Liberals are coming after your pension and the only thing standing between pensioners having  significant cuts to their pension and Mr Abbott, is the Labor Party.”   

 35) Reinstating the Schoolkids Bonus ($4.48 billion)  Sourc  e: Macklin Media Release 1 March 2016 - “In the last two Budgets, the Liberals have 

 proposed... Axing the Schoolkids Bonus... Labor will stand with Australian families against these cuts  every day up to the next election.”

Labor’s announced policy includes four  elements, including thin capitalisation reduced to 30% - this is the only element included in these  numbers; Hybrid rules - redundant as it is included in the 16-17 Budget; Increased ATO compliance -  redundant as it is included in the 16-17 Budget; 3rd party data matching - redundant as the policy was  to bring forward this measure to start on 1 July 2015 instead of 1 July 2016, which has now passed   Shorten, Bowen and Leigh media release 13 April 2015
