 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling GILLARD MUST END HER SELF IMPOSED  POLICY DEADLOCK AS SEVENTH BOAT IN  FOUR DAYS ARRIVES July 18, 2012

 With seven boat arrivals in four days Julia Gillard should end this farce, swallow her pride and restore the policies that worked, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Reports of rogue involvement by Indonesian military supporting people smugglers show just how out of control this issue has become," Mr Morrison said. 

 "The arrest of these individuals by Indonesian authorities is welcome news. However the incident demonstrates that when you throw open your borders in the way Labor has, you set in train a series of forces well beyond your control. 

 "There has been enough talk, enough excuses and enough blame meted out by Labor. None of this will stop the boats. 

 "The  only  deadlock  the  Government  is  in  over  asylum  policy  is  the  one  produced  by  themselves  through  their  own stubborn pride to restore the Howard Government policies that worked. 

 "Under the Howard Government we had less than three boats a year after our policies were put in place to stop the boats, with no boats at all in some years. In 2012 we have an average of three boats per week under Labor's failed approach," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan  said: "Seven boats in four days have arrived as the Government continues to leave the  floodgates open  at Australia’s borders. 

 "Instead of fulfilling the role of the Commonwealth and providing a solution to the crisis this Government created at our borders, they have instead set up a committee that is nothing more than another Labor Party talkfest and no action. 

 "The multi party committee is just wasting both taxpayers’ time and money â the last thing the Australian people want is  another failed policy from this incompetent Government. 

 "The Coalition knows what will stop the boats - we have done it before and this is why we will not help legitimise another  doomed Labor policy," Mr Keenan said.
