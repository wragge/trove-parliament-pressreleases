 Funds to Target New Arrivals MPS 026/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today invited community and service organisations to bid for funds to help migrants, refugees and humanitarian program entrants to settle successfully into the community.

 Funds are being made available through the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, under Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme.

 "The Government can set the policies under which people come to Australia, but community involvement and expertise is essential to the successful settlement of individuals, families and groups," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Government recognises this and is prepared to fund appropriate programs for one, two or three years from 1 October 2000.

 "Organisations will have to demonstrate their capacity to provide the proposed services and the quality of the programs themselves."

 Applications for the funds will appear in newspapers on 4 March and the applications close on 14 April 2000.

 Successful projects will extend and complement the existing network of services available to refugees, humanitarian entrants and other migrants permanently in Australia.

 "We intend to give priority to projects that address the settlement needs of migrants living in remote areas and regions where support services are difficult to access," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Groups within migrant communities facing specific settlement problems and recent arrivals whose communities in Australia are small and emerging, will also be seen as priority areas for funding.

 "Another important area will be programs that cater for refugee and humanitarian entrants, except those who are eligible for specialised services under other Government programs."

 Mr Ruddock said proposals that facilitate client access to mainstream services will be considered favourably, as will proposals that assist mainstream service deliverers develop culturally appropriate services.

 All proposed programs should aim to be self-sustaining within a specified period.
