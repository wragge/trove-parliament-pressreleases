 8 December 2010       

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  DARWIN

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m pleased to be here with Senator David Johnston, the Shadow Minister for Defence, and  also with Natasha Griggs, the Member for Solomon. It was a real honour to go out this  morning on HMAS Glenelg and to see the professionalism of our Navy’s work. They are  doing a fine job under difficult circumstances. Unfortunately their job is much harder because  the Gillard Government has clearly lost control of our borders. Since the Government relaxed  the former Government’s policies, policies that worked to stop the boats, we’ve had nearly  200 illegal boats, we’ve had nearly 10,000 illegal entrants. Since Julia Gillard became Prime  Minister there’s been 55 boats. Since the election there’s been 41 boats and more than 2,000  illegal arrivals. It’s just not good enough.    

 But not only has the Government lost control of our borders it’s hardly in control anywhere.  It’s hardly in control anywhere in our country. Today we see that the national curriculum,  which the Prime Minister personally promised to deliver back in March, has been delayed for  some years. Yesterday we saw the resignation of the National Broadband Network’s  Tasmanian co-ordinator and today we learn that the business plan that the Government  explicitly promised this month is now being put off, further delayed. We have the Murray-Darling Basin plan in crisis because of the shambolic mismanagement by the Government.  We learn today that our foreign allies think about as highly of Kevin Rudd as the Labor  caucus does. Everywhere we look it’s one Labor mess after another and the problem with a  bad Government getting worse is that the public, the tax payer pays for this Government’s  incompetence. Whether it’s higher cost of living, whether it’s higher taxes, whether it’s more  Government spending such as the $1 billion blowout on border protection - the public is  paying the price for this Government’s incompetence.   

 QUESTION:   

 Shouldn’t the Government though get some credit for getting New South Wales to finally  agree to the national curriculum?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Nevertheless, the national curriculum is being delayed by some years. This was a promise  that the Prime Minister personally made to the Australian people back in March. This was a  covenant if you like that the Prime Minister made with the Australian people and now it’s not  going to happen.   

 QUESTION:   

 On Wikileaks, do you agree with the approach the Prime Minister has taken, saying that  Julian Assange has committed an illegal act and basically you can’t expect consular support?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 If anyone has committed any offence that person should be prosecuted. The point I make is  that any release of confidential information that compromises national and international  security is deeply regrettable.   

 QUESTION:   

 Should Australian politicians, though, be deciding that someone’s committed an illegal act.  You know, presumably the Prime Minister doesn’t have, you know, all the details of why the  info has come out?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The point I make is that there are appropriate authorities. In the end, this is a matter for the  appropriate authorities, headed up ultimately by the Attorney-General, and if any offences  have been committed, well then, the Government should take appropriate action.   

 QUESTION:   

 What’s your opinion on the comments that have been made in relation to Kevin Rudd?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, as I said, they are the sorts of comments that were being made by his fellow members  of caucus and I guess it now seems that not only did the caucus know what he was like but  our allies knew what he was like, but he’s still there as Foreign Minister.   

 The basic problem, though, is it’s not just Kevin Rudd. It’s the Government that is the  problem because our foreign policy has been just as badly managed since Julia Gillard took  over as it was under Kevin Rudd. Look at the East Timor detention centre. It was a thought  bubble which has now compromised relations with Indonesia and other neighbours and it is  never going to happen.    

 QUESTION: 

 

 Would you say Kevin Rudd’s fit to be the Foreign Minister if the U.S. don’t have faith in  him?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 As I said, it’s pretty clear that the Foreign Minister, the former Prime Minister’s style is a  problem. You didn’t need the release of confidential information to know that. You only  needed to listen to Labor members around the corridors of parliament and obviously that’s  something that journalists have been doing for months, that’s something that even Coalition  members have been doing for months.   

 QUESTION:   

 Did the Navy say that they’ve changed any procedures since the Ashmore Reef blast with the  asylum seeker boat when you were out today?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I just want to talk about the professionalism of the Navy, how much I admire their work.  They are doing a fine job under difficult circumstances. I wish they weren’t as busy as they  are and if the Government had a proper border protection policy in place, they wouldn’t be  under as much pressure as they are.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, on the topic of the Northern Territory Liberal Party, did you or anyone from your  office speak to Terry Mills about Leo Abbott before or after an offer was made to Leo  Abbott?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’ve just had no involvement in this matter.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, just to quote the transcript here of what Mr Mills said, ‘I have Tony Abbott’s word that if  he be the PM will be in a strong position to look after you’. Does it bother you that senior  members of your own party have implicated you in this?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I’ve just had no involvement in this and it’s as simple as that.   

 QUESTION:   

 But should members of the Liberal Party be involved in such things like this? You are the  leader and surely it’s your role to make sure that these sorts of things aren’t happening.   

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 

 And look, I have lots of conversations with my colleagues, lots of conversations with my  colleagues and I want my colleagues to focus on beating bad governments and that’s what I  want to do. I want to expose and replace a bad government and I think that’s what my Liberal  and Coalition colleagues right around Australia should be doing.   

 QUESTION:    

 Have you spoken to Terry Mills about all of this since it happened?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I have lots of conversations with my colleagues and my focus is constantly on how do we  expose…   

 QUESTION:    

 Is that a yes?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 …how do we expose and hopefully replace very bad governments and this is a very bad  Labor Government here in the Territory.    

 QUESTION:    

 If you were prime minister, would you sack Kevin Rudd?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, if I were prime minister, Kevin Rudd wouldn’t be in my political party, he wouldn’t be  in my cabinet?    

 QUESTION:    

 But would you?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, as I said, if I were prime minister, Kevin Rudd wouldn’t be in my cabinet. It’s as  simple as that.    

 QUESTION:    

 Has Terry Mills misrepresented your position then, though, because he basically said in  according to this transcript, you know Tony Abbott can’t condone this but he’s made it clear  to me that there will be something we can do for you if you step down as the Lingiari  candidate?    

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 

 All I would really want to say about the conversations I have with my colleagues is that we  focus constantly on what we can do to expose and replace very bad Labor governments…   

 QUESTION:    

 Are you saying Mr Abbott that those conversations are private?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m saying that I had absolutely no involvement in the matter in question. None whatsoever.    

 QUESTION:    

 Did anyone from your office have any involvement?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Neither. I had no involvement. No one from my office had any involvement.    

 QUESTION:    

 What could the Territory or Federal Government’s be doing better to ease cost of living  pressures in northern Australian because the Northern Territory has the highest rate of  inflation and some of the highest cost of living pressures in the nation?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, one of the things that the Commonwealth Government could do is ensure that the  unused Defence houses on the local air base are occupied once more. This was a commitment  that we took to the election. This was a commitment that Natasha Griggs made and that  certainly would be one way of doing something to ease the housing cost pressure here in  Darwin, but the best way that the Government can try to ensure that people’s cost of living  pressures don’t get worse is not to have a carbon tax. Not to have a mining tax. The first rule  of government is don’t make difficult situations worse, and that’s one of the big problems  with this Labor Government. It sees an issue and it immediately thinks more government,  more tax.    

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible] if Defence says we need that land for other strategic purposes, shouldn’t whoever  is in power listen to the Department of Defence?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think that if you’ve had Defence houses empty for a long time, that’s plainly not a good use  of existing resources.    

 Thank you so much.
