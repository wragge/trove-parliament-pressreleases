 MEDIA RELEASE

 SEVENTH BOAT SINCE TONY ABBOTT SAID ‘NO’   

 A boat carrying more than 140 asylum seekers was intercepted off Christmas Island overnight -  the seventh since Tony Abbott chose to kill-off talks with the Government to reinstate offshore  processing.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home Affairs,  Jason Clare MP, said today that the Government had warned that without a real deterrent for  these dangerous journeys to Australia, the boats would keep coming.   

 Mr Bowen said only a genuine deterrent such as the Malaysia Arrangement as part of an offshore  processing regime could deliver a safer and more orderly migration program.   

 “This is yet another boat you can chalk down to Tony Abbottâs negative politics. The Coalition  leader has no qualms about putting his own political interest over the national interest,” Mr  Bowen said.   

 “He is refusing to work with the Government to implement offshore processing and has even said  ânoâ to reopening a processing centre on Nauru, rejecting long-held Liberal policy.   

 “Mr Abbott clearly prefers to see more boats arrive because he believes itâs in his political  interest.”   

 The Government is prepared to work with the Coalition to see offshore processing legislation  pass through the Parliament. That included offering to establish a centre on Nauru to  complement the Malaysian Arrangement.   

 Mr Clare said boats would continue to come to Australia unless the Coalition was willing to work  with the Government to deter asylum seekers from taking these dangerous boat journeys.   

 “In the three months after Mr Abbott said no to our legislation the number of asylum seekers  tripled,” Mr Clare said.    

 In the three months before Mr Abbott said no to our legislation in September, 12 boats with 764  people arrived. In the three months after Mr Abbott said no, 30 boats and 2,204 people arrived.    

 “This shows the boats will keep coming as long as Mr Abbott says no,” Mr Clare said.    

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our legislation  to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
