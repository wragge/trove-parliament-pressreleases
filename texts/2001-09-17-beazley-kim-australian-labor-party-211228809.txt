 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Federal Court Tampa Appeal

 Transcript - Parliament House, Canberra - 17 September 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: The decision by the Federal court in the Tampa case gives Australians and Australia a breathing space to sit down and sensibly look at border protection issues. In the spirit of a bipartisan approach - which we have always shown on these matters - my Shadow Attorney-General has sent to his counterpart, Daryl Williams, a set of suggestions whereby our borders may be better protected, that is workable and effective as opposed to unconstitutional and unlawful.

 We have just witnessed in Parliament a solid bipartisan approach to the issues affecting national security in the ANZUS response to he horrific events in the United States last week. We need decisions on all these matters in this atmosphere in the national interest and not in a partisan interest. We stand there ready always for a bipartisan solution to these problems.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, does that set of solutions that have been sent to the Attorney-General include support for excising Ashmore Reef, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands from Australia's migration zone?

 BEAZLEY: We have yet to see that legislation. We have said that we are prepared to look reasonably at the propositions that they put forward on that matter. We have yet to see them. We would want to look at the detail, we'd want to look at how this affected the residents of those islands, we'd want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences associated with it. But we are prepared to approach their legislation in a mode determined by a conviction that we need to act in the national interest. I hope their attitude is the same.

 JOURNALIST: Do you support the principle of that Bill, though?

 BEAZLEY: As I said, we are prepared to look at it. I've said before, on this, that if it was workable, we were prepared to look at it favourably but we want to see its workability. I'm surprised that we haven't got it yet, frankly. It's been over a week since these propositions were first mooted about in public and they haven't come yet.

 JOURNALIST: What do you see as the key difference between the way that Labor would handle the issue and what the Government has proposed so far?

 BEAZLEY: We don't want to see people willy-nilly coming into Australia breaking our immigration laws. We want to see the right treatment of refugees and we also want, however, people to have confidence in our borders. I think the only solutions are to these in the end are long-term solutions, and those long-term solutions lie in the heart of our relationship with Indonesia. If you actually want to get decent border protection, you need a decent relationship with the country … not the country of origin so much but the country of embarkation. That's always been my firm view and its, so far, has been proved unattainable by this Government.

 JOURNALIST: Indonesia … that it's not that interested in it.

 BEAZLEY: It was once. You know, when we were in office, hardly anyone came through. That has changed and it can change back again.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, what's your position on currently the Government turning away the boats from Ashmore Reef etc and Indonesia not letting them back so that they're in No Man's Land. Do you support that breach of the refugee convention?

 BEAZLEY: We pointed out always the Government didn't need its Border Protection legislation, that it had the authority to turn people away from our borders if there was an assumption that they were going to enter our area illegally for illegal purposes. We said they did not need any legislation to do that and apparently that's been demonstrated.

 JOURNALIST: So, you support the Government turning away these boats from Ashmore Reef even though they can't go back to Indonesia?

 BEAZLEY: We support an orderly refugee program and it remains to be seen what happens with those boats. Thus far, after a period of time, they appear to have been picked up and sent taken over to a safe haven in Nauru. It remains to be seen whether that continues to be the case.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, there are reports that the Manoora has arrived at Nauru and that most of, the bulk of the boat people are refusing to leave the Manoora. Do you support that it's an Australian ship forced being used to get them off?

 BEAZLEY: I haven't seen those reports and so I wouldn't comment on them. I would have thought that it would be a relief to get off the boat and get on dry land and to get yourselves properly processed by the UNHCR on your refugee status. As the Prime Minister has said, the substantial proportion of those who find themselves on Nauru are going to end up here. He made that amply clear in the time that that happened. And I support an orderly process whereby people come to this country as refugees, indeed I do.

 JOURNALIST: What if they do refuse to leave the boat?

 BEAZLEY: I haven't seen those reports so I wouldn't comment on them.

 JOURNALIST: There's breathing space not only for border protection here but also for the ALP, which has been under significant pressure over this issue?

 BEAZLEY: I think it's an opportunity to get the Government to now decide to look at these issues a bit rationally, to stop at legislating producing bad legislation in haste and sit down and think through these issues sensibly. There's an opportunity for that now. We have always been in that. There have been

 repeated efforts by this Government to put up legislation and we've always been prepared to sit down and think them through sensibly and not to seek political advantage in the way in which they've been handled in this Parliament. Now, I just hope that we can get that on a bipartisan basis.

 JOURNALIST: Given the length of time that these people have been at sea, would you appeal to the Victorian Civil Liberties not to take this case to a higher court?

 BEAZLEY: I don't interfere with anybody's business before the courts in the same way as I don't interfere with anybody's business in industrial relations. I think people make their own determination as to what they'd want to do. But I would have thought, in fact, that the people aboard those boats would probably want to make landfall pretty soon. They've been at sea for a very, very long time.

 JOURNALIST: Does this decision change in any way your thoughts about the Border Protection Bill?

 BEAZLEY: Only to this extent, I suppose, it does indicate that what was said originally - that the Border Protection Bill was not necessary for that course of action - I suppose you could say is vindicated. But there may be more legal water to flow under that particular bridge. But I tell you what legal water will never flow under that bridge and that is anything that vindicates the Border Protection Bill they tried to put in place a few weeks ago.

 Thanks very much.
