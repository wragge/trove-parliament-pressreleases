 …  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  vast  majority  of  students  in   Australian  schools  will  have  progressed  through  a  systematic   study of Australian history by the end of Year 10.  Indeed, the  opposite  is  almost  certainly  the  case.   By  the  time  they  reach   leaving  age,  most  students  in  Australian  schools  will  have   experienced a fragmented, repetitive and incomplete picture of  their national story (p 34)

 This overview summarises the approaches of all states and territories  to  the  teaching  and  learning  of  Australian  history.  The  information   has been collected primarily from curriculum documents, with some  assistance from teachers and curriculum offi cials. Having said that,  it is frequently very diff i cult to discern in several of the curriculum  documents  where  exactly  the  teaching  of  Australian  history  may   be found.

 The  state/territory  summaries  are  arranged  alphabetically.  Each   individual summary follows a particular pattern. First, there is a brief  general  background.  Second,  to  provide  a  context,  there  is  a  brief   overview of the place of history within the curriculum. Third, there is a 

 longer section on Australian history. Then, comes a comment section  which represents the views of the author, based on his professional  experience. Finally, you will fi nd a short, illustrative opinion piece by  members  of  the  relevant  History  Teachers’  Association  (HTA)  who   might be teachers, curriculum offi cials, or history educators with very  close links to schools. Where the HTA does not exist, an experienced  and well-regarded history teacher has been consulted. The function  of the fi nal practitioner commentary is to provide the reader with an  illustrative view from inside each education system. These comments  are not meant to be representative but they do come from experienced  professionals.

 The  author  has  then  outlined  a  set  of  conclusions,  based  on  the   evidence and on his professional experience.

 There  then  follows  a  series  of  appendices,  Appendix  A  consists   of  relevant  curriculum  documentation  from  the  various  states  and   territories. One point to note about this part of the appendix section  is that the state/territory excerpts have been culled from documents  which are frequently lengthy, almost algebraic in character and jargon-laden. As an example of the diffi culty that the general reader might  face  when  tackling  a  curriculum  document,  the  South  Australian   material  relevant  to  this  exercise  (Primary  Years  Band  and  Middle   Years  Band)  is  584  pages  long.  As  for  obscure  terminology,  the   Tasmanian government decided in May 2006 to bring in Don Watson  as a “jargon-buster” for the about-to-be revised curriculum document.  That  being  the  case,  I  have  provided  a  short  glossary  of  common   educational terms at the end of the paper. 

 Next comes a very short summary of two signifi cant research projects  (Appendix  B)  on  how  students  learn  history  and  a  brief  statement   (Appendix C) of what constitutes historical literacy

 Finally, Appendix D, National Consistency in Curriculum Outcomes,  Draft  Statements  of  Learning  for  Civics  and  Citizenship,  provides   information  on  the  draft  Statements  of  Learning  being  developed   for approval by Ministers. The Statements are intended to establish  common  approaches  to  civics  and  citizenship  education  in  all

 The Background

 The ACT’s current education system is unique in that it has school-based  curriculum  K-12.  This  means  that  individual  schools  decide   how to arrange and assess their teaching, learning and assessment,  within a broad set of departmental curriculum guidelines drawn up in  1990. Some senior schools (colleges) form groups to share planning  time  and  resources  but  generally  each  school  has  a  great  deal  of   autonomy in deciding its curriculum.

 The Place of History

 From years K-10, History is studied primarily within a Time, Continuity  and Change strand, part of the Studies of Society and Environment  (SOSE)  Key  Learning  Area  (KLA).  ACT  has  an  outcomes-based   approach to learning. 

 Australian History 3-10

 There is no prescribed curriculum and there are no particular timetable  requirements  for  Australian  history.  The  only  mandatory  subject  in   ACT schools is physical education.

 The relevant Time Continuity and Change section of the framework  is brief. Students are expected to demonstrate, amongst other  things, a “knowledge and understanding of the past in Australia and  in the world”, and historical themes are contained in several of the  nine cross-curricular “curriculum perspectives”. These are meant to  inform the whole curriculum. One relevant perspective is “Australian  education”. It deals with issues of national identity and other Australian  issues in a local national and Asia-Pacifi c context. A second is the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspective, which is concerned  with  students  developing  an  appreciation  “of  the  achievements   of  Aboriginal  culture  and  Torres  Strait  Island  cultures  in  Australian   society.” A third is “Gender equity” where, for example, students are  to ask “whose history is documented in many history texts and whose  interests are served {no question mark}”. In the “Global” perspective,  students develop an appreciation of Australia’s place in the world. 

 The curriculum framework also contains a list of “Essential learning  about Australia”.

 The list includes the following topics which have an historical aspect  or approach: 

 â¢   important  epochs,  events  and  people  in  Australia’s  past   before 1788

 â¢   signifi  cant  events  and  key  fi  gures  in  Australia’s  past   after 1788

 â¢  the ways of life of various groups in Australia’s past and  present, changes over time in their roles in Australian society  and their contribution to Australia today

 â¢   the  origin  and  operation  of  Australia’s  government,  legal,   political systems and structures

 â¢  the origin and operation of Australia’s economic systems and  structures

 â¢  aspects of the cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Australians

 â¢  aspects of Australian culture deriving from England, Ireland,  Scotland and Wales

 â¢   aspects  of  cultures  of  Australians  of  non-English-speaking   backgrounds

 â¢   the  infl uence  of  Australian  policies  and  practices  on  other   societies and cultures particularly in the Asia-Pacifi c region

 â¢   the  infl uence  of  other  societies  and  cultures  on  Australian   peoples, cultures, beliefs and practices.

 Comment

 This particular school-based approach has been in existence since  1990,  which  makes  it  Australia’s  longest  established  curriculum   framework.  The  combination  of  a  SOSE  Key  Learning  Area  within   a  school-based  curriculum  was  criticised  by  ACT  teachers  in  the   1999-2000 National Inquiry on the grounds that history had become  a  neglected  area.  On  the  face  of  it,  students  could  reach  Year  10   having  studied  very  little  Australian  history  as  a  discrete  subject.   Currently,  ACT  is  piloting  the  revised  Essential  Learnings  school-based curriculum framework which will replace the 1990 document.

 A Practitioner’s View

 “It is very hard to generalise about what, precisely, is being done  in ACT schools.

 Of  the  (large)  schools  physically  in  the  ACT,  all  but  one  are   certifi cated  by  the  ACT  Department  (the  exception  is  Boys’   Grammar,  which  uses  the  NSW  HSC  for  Year  12),  which   notionally means that they follow system level leads on content.  However,  there  has  been  no  signifi cant  curriculum  leadership   from  the  centre  for  some  time.  Various  ‘initiatives’  which  may   have an impact on curriculum content - eg the Health Promoting  Schools  initiative  -  occasionally  crop  up.  In  short,  there  is  no   mandatory curriculum content in the ACT - except for a certain  number  of  hours  of  PE  (since  the  late  1990s).  Literacy  and  

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   4 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   4 3/08/2006   8:54:57 3/08/2006   8:54:57

 numeracy  testing,  along  with  the  Year  10  ICT  Certifi cate,  are   the  closest  the  ACT  system  gets  to  requiring  specifi c  content   or skills.

 To a degree, this situation is about to change with the roll out of  the ACT Essential Learning Achievements (ELAs) for K-10. Two  of the [38] ELAs have signifi  cant historical elements to them - ‘the  student knows about Australia and Australians’ and ‘the student  knows about world events’ (not sure of the exact wording).

 In  primary  schools,  mandatory  testing,  and  teaching  through   themes,  means  that  the  greatest  focus  is  on  literacy  and   numeracy  development.  No  doubt  some  students  come   across sustained and high quality exposure to historical topics,  approaches and pedagogy; in general, however, I suspect that  most students receive, at best, a rather patchy introduction to  history in primary schools. 

 History as a core study in (7-10) secondary schools generally  exists as part of a SOSE curriculum. Some schools actually go  so far as to call the subject History when reporting to parents,  when the content has been historical. A signifi  cant number of high  schools (probably more than half) offer history as an elective to  students in Years 9 & 10. Australian history is likely to be a part  of the core SOSE curriculum, while more exotic types - eg Asian  history, or Revolutions - would be elective. Since history exists  “inside” SOSE, there are a signifi cant number of teachers who  teach history, but who do not self identify as history teachers.  Many of these are highly professional and effective teachers, but  it is impossible to say what degree of training in historical method  and history pedagogy these people have been through. There  are  undoubtedly  some  teachers  with  no  training  whatsoever   (and little expertise?) teaching ‘history’ to students. SOSE itself  is not particularly in favour in ACT schools, and seems to be one  of the areas where some administrators think that anyone who  can breathe can teach it (let alone history).”

 The background

 New  South  Wales  quickly  opted  out  of  the  early  1990s  national   consensus  about  SOSE,  choosing  instead  a  fairly  non-contentious   primary school approach to the humanities - Human Society and its  Environment  -  more  commonly  known  as  HSIE,  and  a  discipline-based approach to history in the secondary school. 

 However,  the  1992  junior  secondary  school  history  syllabus  (7-10)   was  publicly  attacked  in  the  mid-90s  for  being,  simultaneously,   ideologically-driven  and  vague.  It  was  replaced  by  the  1999  junior   secondary school syllabus with its mandatory 100 hours of Australian  history  in  Years  9  and  10,  to  be  assessed  by  a  Year  10  multiple-choice and short question examination. The 1999 junior secondary  history syllabus was in turn criticised for being too content-heavy, too  prescriptive and too off-putting for students. Following a prolonged  campaign by, amongst others, the New South Wales History Teachers’  Association, the 1999 syllabus was reviewed in 2002 and replaced by  the current model. 

 The Place of History

 There is a special focus in NSW on the value of history. For example, it  is the only state that consciously aspires to having secondary history  teachers  with  an  appropriate  academic  background.  Furthermore,   until the 1990s, a strong departmental structure in many secondary  schools bolstered the strength of much history teaching, since Head  Teachers of History (who are often Head Teachers of English as well)  provide strong leadership roles in the discipline. An indicator of the  subject’s strength lies in the 2005 fi gures for HSC history with over 10  336 students taking Ancient History and 9 996 taking Modern History  (which includes an Australian history component). New South Wales  has a large and very active History Teachers’ Association. 

 In  primary  schools,  history  topics  are  integrated  into  HSIE  from   Kindergarten  to  Grade  6.  In  secondary  schools,  history  has  not   changed  its  position  as  a  key,  discipline-based  study.  In  junior   secondary, history is taught as a distinct academic subject from  Year 7 to Year 10 in a way that integrates clearly identifi ed content  with  historical  skills,  starting  at  Year  7.  For  example,  students  are   required to understand, analyse and interpret historical evidence and  employ investigation techniques. The 20th century Australian history  course taught in Year 10 is assessed by public examination for the  School Certifi cate.

 Australian History 3-10

 Primary School Years 3-6

 History topics are found mainly in the ‘change and continuity’ strand  of the NSW HSIE K-6 Syllabus. Students in Years 3-6 (Stages 2 & 3)  study British colonisation and its impact on Aboriginal people and the  environment and key aspects of 19th century Australian history, with  a focus on the importance of past people and events, such  as the  gold rushes. They also study the history of their local community, the  background to historical commemorations such as Australia Day and  Anzac Day, and the development of Australian democracy. Students  are encouraged to use various sources for reconstructing the past,  for  example  letters,  diaries,  maps,  photographs,  oral  traditions  and   Aboriginal art.

 Secondary School Years 7-10

 In  Years  7  and  8  (Stage  4),  students  tackle  a  topic  “Investigating   History”,  which  examines  ancient  and  medieval  societies  and  their   legacies, and the impact of colonisation on Australia and one other  nation. 

 In Years 9 and 10 (Stage 5), students look at 20th century Australian  history through eight topics outlined below. The topics are taught in  one year or spread over two years:

 Year 9

 â¢ Australia to 1914 (federation, living and working conditions)

 â¢ Australia and WWI (Gallipoli and the Anzac legend) 

 â¢ Australia Between the Wars (varying experiences of individuals  and groups, key events and political developments) 

 â¢ Australia and WWII (why and where Australia was involved,  campaigns  and  experiences  of  servicemen  and  women,   nurses,  POWs,  impact  on  the  home  front,  Australia’s   relationship with Britain and the USA). 

 Year 10

 â¢ Australia in the Vietnam War Era (responses to the threat of  communism, involvement in and differing views of the Vietnam  War, impact of the war on groups such as Indo-Chinese  refugees and Vietnam Veterans) 

 â¢ Changing  Rights  and  Freedoms  (change over time in the  experiences and struggle for rights and freedoms of Aboriginal  Australians, women and migrants)

 â¢ People  Power  and  Politics  (Australia’s role in the United  Nations, Prime Ministers and policies and signifi cant events 

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   7 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   7 3/08/2006   8:54:58 3/08/2006   8:54:58

 and issues and the individuals involved e.g. Jack Mundey and  the Green Bans)

 â¢ Australia’s Social and Cultural History in the Post-War Period  (the impact of technology on everyday life and a close study of  the social and cultural features of one decade). These topics  are examined in the School Certifi cate.

 Students in Years 9 and 10 may choose to undertake an additional  History  Elective  course  for  the  School  Certifi cate.  History  Elective   looks  at  different  kinds  of  historical  approaches  for  example  family   history, local history and the contribution of museums and archives.

 Comment

 Now that the NSW history controversies of the past decade have all but  died down, the Australian element in the current NSW junior secondary  syllabus (7-10) appears to demonstrate a reasonable combination of  (1)  content  (2)  skills  (developing  historical  understanding)  and  (3)   internal/external assessment. There remain, however, three problems.  First, there is no overall understanding of what goes on in primary  school  HSIE.  Second,  at  the  secondary  school  level,  experienced   HTA  members  are  exercised  by  the  structural  reorganisations  that   have  taken  place  (for  example,  from  History  department  to  HSIE   faculty) within government and non-government schools which, they  argue, reduces the capacity of Head Teachers of History to promote  their subject area. Third, there is still some resistance amongst many  experienced and highly capable NSW history teachers to the amount  of content to be covered in the current timeframe and to the idea of a  Year 10 public examination in the subject. 

 A Practitioner’s View

 “Though mandated, quality of instruction is diffi cult to determine.  As always, it depends on the teacher. There is no way of knowing  how well the history strand is covered in primary, there is nothing  to compel trainee primary teachers to undertake any history in  their  degree.  With  secondary,  compulsion  and  the  collapse  of   History  departments  into  HSIE  departments  has  meant  that   many  classes  are  taught  by  teachers  without  history  training.   Senior numbers are healthy … so it seems to be working OK  …  The  fact  that  only  half  the  Stage  5  content  is  examined  is   another improvement.

 There was far too much content in the previous Stage 5 History  syllabus and it was too political. There was no time to explore  anything  in  the  depth  required  for  meaningful  understanding,   and  not  enough  time  to  introduce  and  consolidate  essential   historical skills … 

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   8 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   8 3/08/2006   8:54:58 3/08/2006   8:54:58

 The  current  syllabus  is  a  great  improvement  -  there’s  a  better   balance of social and political history and there’s more choice  within and between sub-topics. With strategic programming, it’s  possible to combine aspects from different topics to develop a  compact program where you can cover fewer areas in greater  depth. This then gives more time to integrate and develop skills  - but it’s still a lot to do in only 100 hours. 

 The test is a big improvement too - only examining the last 50  hours  instead  of  the  whole  course  makes  a  lot  of  sense.  In   schools that semesterise, kids were being examined at the end  of year 10 on topics they had studied at the beginning of Year 9  - we don’t even ask that of our senior students!! 

 100  hours  is  good,  but  more  would  be  better.  History  and   Geography as separate subjects get only a quarter of the hours  given to each of the core subjects English, Maths and Science  (100 vs 400). When you consider the literacy skills, the research  and critical thinking skills and the civics and citizenship that are  taught through History, 100 hours is simply not enough. If it’s to  have parity with other ‘core’ subjects, it needs more hours.”

 Background

 School education in the Northern Territory is guided by the Northern  Territory Curriculum Framework, from Transition (K) to Year 10. For  the post-compulsory years, students are taught the curriculum from  the Senior Secondary Assessment Board of South Australia. 

 The Northern Territory Curriculum Framework is an outcomes-based  curriculum,  which  is  very  clearly  directed  towards  the  varied  and   particular expectations and educational experiences of NT students.  Indigenous perspectives are one of the cross-curricular emphases in  the framework, and it is clear that the high percentage of indigenous  students  in  the  Territory  has  shaped  this  curriculum  document  in   ways that are substantially different to curriculum frameworks in other  educational jurisdictions in Australia. For example, the high incidence  of  students  for  whom  English  is  a  second  language,  especially  in   remote communities, is an important factor in NT curriculum design,  as is the issue of student attainment in the national benchmarks for  literacy and numeracy. This particular educational and social setting  provides  the  background  for  the  NT  Curriculum  Framework,  which   emphasises the need for teaching and learning fl exibility, as well as  the reporting of student outcomes and achievement.

 The place of history

 The  NT  SOSE  Learning  Area  incorporates  the  disciplines  of   History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Business and Careers and  is  taught  until  Year  10.  In  Years  11  and  12,  History  is  taught  as  a   discrete discipline for the Northern Territory Certifi cate of Education.  NT students take the SSABSA history syllabus in Years 11 and 12  but  Australian  Studies,  compulsory  in  South  Australia  (q.v.),  is  not   compulsory in NT.

 The  Northern  Territory  curriculum  framework  uses  an  outcomes-based approach that is framed around four esseNTial (sic) learnings  and three cross-curricular perspectives that incorporate fi ve learning  bands from years 2-10.

 There are outcomes for the SOSE learning area at each of the fi ve  learning  bands  of  student  development.  SOSE  is  organised  into   2  strands  of  learning  from  Bands  1-3  (years  2-6)  and  3  strands  in   Bands 4 and 5 (years 7-10). History is primarily located in the Social  Systems and Structures strand in SOSE:

 Australian History 3-10

 There  is  no  detailed  curriculum  requirement  and  no  particular   timetable allocation for Australian history. 

 From Band 2 (Years 3 and 4) on students begin to learn about their  community and its heritage. In upper primary (Band 3) they are then  taught aspects of Northern Territory history and pre-twentieth century  Australian  history  (such  as  indigenous  histories,  the  Macassan   traders,  contact  and  colonisation,  the  penal  colonies,  and  the  gold   rushes). 

 Bands 4 and 5 (years 7-10) deal specifi cally with Australian history,  and  the  impact  of  world  events  on  Australia  (such  as  the  Great   Depression,  Vietnam,  immigration,  trade,  foreign  relations).  For   example, Indigenous Studies at both Band levels examines pre- and  post-contact  Indigenous  histories,  including  the  impact  of  contact   and  colonisation  of  Aboriginal  communities.  The  Time,  Continuity   and  Change  strand  concentrates  on  twentieth  century  Australian   history, such as Federation, WWI, and the Great Depression. It also  includes more recent issues in Australian history such as land rights,  Native Title, immigration, and the environment. “Civics, Governance  and Social Justice” examines events leading up to Federation, with a  particular emphasis on attitudes in the Northern Territory compared  with those of other States. 

 Comment

 While history is not outlined as a separate discipline in the Northern  Territory curriculum framework, there is quite clearly defi ned historical  content within SOSE. There is also a clear progression of content and  of  the  skills  integral  to  historical  understanding  and  there  does  not   appear to be such a large potential for content repetition or overlap as  in some other jurisdictions. Furthermore, the curriculum has a sense 

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   11 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   11 3/08/2006   8:54:58 3/08/2006   8:54:58

 of coherence as students move from their immediate (family) past,  through the past of their communities and the Northern Territory, to a  wider national and international historical understanding. This means  that while Australian history is taught within an integrated curriculum  (via SOSE), the historical content and understanding required from  students are quite clearly articulated.

 Many  students  in  regional  and  remote  communities  are  taught  in   community  schools,  where  lessons  are  often  conducted  in  local   language, so issues of ESL and English literacy are particularly relevant  for analysis of curriculum design in NT schools. For example, the NT  Curriculum Services Branch has been trying to increase the numbers  of indigenous students taking senior school Indigenous Studies, but  teachers  are  reluctant  to  introduce  a  relatively  demanding  course   (that includes a 2000 word research essay) into classrooms where  levels of English literacy and comprehension can be relatively low.

 A Practitioner’s View

 “The  Northern  Territory  Curriculum  Framework  document   dictates content and essential learnings for secondary students  in the Northern Territory. The NTCF is a broad in its scope and  faculties and teachers are able to select sections to be addressed  across the year levels. This allows choice but not consistency in  the learning content between schools. There is a great deal of  focus on the social impacts and implications of history and very  little in the way of ‘events’ based focus. It certainly succeeds in  encouraging critical thinking when it is delivered properly.

 The  current  heavy  push  towards  Middle  Schooling  means   that  Australian  (and  all  other)  history  is  delivered  up  to  Year   10  as  integrated  units  -  often  tying  in  with  English  and  other   Humanities subjects. This has resulted in the historical learning  being  made  more  contextual  for  students  and  often  delivered   in more dynamic ways. However, the concept of middle school  teaching  (integration  and  ‘core’  teachers)  also  means  that   historical  studies  are  often  delivered  by  teachers  who  are  not   history (or even Humanities) ‘specialists’ and this is resulting in  the watering down of history specifi c skills. 

 History is seen not as a discrete subject but part of the broader  Humanities discipline which, as a whole, is treated as a ‘core’  subject  equal  to  Science  or  Maths.  The  NTCF  allows  a  very   fl exible approach and teachers can choose their content. What  this does mean though, is that history, and especially Australian  history, has to fi  ght for curriculum ‘time’ with the other Humanities  subjects. By Year 10 it is felt that students should be broadening  their historical knowledge and most history has moved towards  global experiences (particularly the wars) and Australian history  is slotted into a world context rather than being a focus.

 As an aside - there is no Australian specifi c history course in  Year  11,  but  Year  12  Australian  History  exists  and,  although   a  fabulous  and  much  more  achievable  course,  struggles  to   compete with the more glamorous World History course.”

 Background

 The Queensland curriculum uses an outcomes-based approach and  history is located in the SOSE Key Learning Area. SOSE is drawn  from disciplines and areas of study that include history, geography,  economics,  politics,  sociology,  anthropology,  law,  psychology  and   ethics, as well as studies such as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander,  Asian,  Australian,  civics  and  citizenship,  enterprise,  environmental,   futures, gender, global, media, rural issues and peace.

 There are also a number of emphases and priorities that permeate  the Queensland curriculum. Key values (democratic process, social  justice,  ecological  and  economic  sustainability,  and  peace)  as   well  as  learning  processes  (investigating,  creating,  participating,   communicating  and  refl ecting).  These  help  frame  the  curriculum,   along with the cross-curricular priorities of Literacy, Numeracy, Life  Skills and a Futures Perspective.

 There have been no public examinations at any level in the Queensland  education system for over thirty years. School-based assessment is  the norm.

 The place of history

 There  are  four  strands  in  the  current  SOSE  KLA.  They  are  Time,   Continuity and Change, Place and Space, Culture and Identity, and  Systems, Resources and Power. In each strand there are six levels  (Levels 1-6, with students expected to complete levels 2 -6 at Years  3-10). In each strand, at each level, there is a ‘Level statement’ that  describes  an  overall  focus,  and  a  matching  set  of  “Core  Learning   Outcomes”.

 The time allocation for SOSE is 80 hours per year in Years 1-3 and  60 hours per year in Years 4-10.

 Historical  content  is  emphasised  in  Time,  Continuity  and  Change   (TCC),  but  is  found  also  in  the  three  other  Strands.  In  designing   curriculum  units  in  SOSE,  teachers  usually  include  outcomes  from   more than one Strand, and often from all four. 

 Australian History in Years 3-10

 There  is  no  prescribed  curriculum  and  there  are  no  particular   timetable  requirements  for  Australian  history.  There  are  however   required outcomes in Australian history and a timetable allocation for  SOSE (see above).

 As  far  as  Australian  history  is  concerned,  the  Core  Learning   Outcomes describe processes, concepts and content in general  terms.  For  example,  Core  Learning  Outcome  5.4  reads:  ‘Students   explain  the  consequences  of  Australia’s  international  relations  on  

 QUEENSLAND (QLD)

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   14 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   14 3/08/2006   8:54:59 3/08/2006   8:54:59

 15

 the development of a cohesive society’. In a separate ‘Core content’  section of the syllabus, more detail is provided - viz. ‘consequences  of Australia’s international relations (the ANZAC tradition, Australian- US relationship, trade with Asian nations, Cold War, involvement in  international  agencies  and  agreements,  UN  peacekeeping)’  -  but   the syllabus states ‘Items in parentheses are examples only’. Thus,  teachers are free to select the specifi c historical content for study by  their students. 

 The  SOSE  syllabus  allows  schools  to  teach  a  discipline-based   approach  in  Years  9-10.  This  allows  a  specifi c  school  to  meet  the   SOSE outcomes by combining two of the three optional syllabuses in  History, Civics and Geography.

 At  levels  3-6  (Years  4-10)  Australian  content  is  inserted  in  the   outcomes.  For  example,  Level  3  (mid-upper  primary)  insists  that   students  examine  “particular  developments  in  Australia’s  history”.   At  Level  4,  there  is  an  emphasis  on  “Australian  or  global”  history,   similarly at Level 5. At Level 6, Australian history can be studied in an  “Australian or Asian” outcome.

 Furthermore,  Australian  content  is  required  in  Culture  and  Identity   at Level 3 under “Australian society” and again with “Aboriginal and  Torres  Strait  islander  cultures”.  Aboriginal  or  Torres  Strait  Islander   groups are a required outcome at Level 5 Culture and Identity.

 In the ‘Core content’ section of the curriculum framework ‘examples’ of  possible Australian content are listed including ‘Australian’, ‘personal’,  ‘local’, ‘familiar’ or ‘Aboriginal’ content examples, listed in 23 of the 30  sections of the ‘Core content’ matrix. This ‘core content’ is not actually  prescribed  historical  ‘content’,  as  such,  but  historical  knowledge  or   understanding. In other words, content is effectively ‘interchangeable’  in  the  Queensland  curriculum,  to  meet  the  outcomes.  Teachers   can  choose  different  examples  from  Australian  history  to  meet  the   ‘core content’ requirements depending on the different interests and  abilities of their students.

 Development  of  historical  understanding  in  the  Queensland   curriculum is sequential in terms of both skills and content. Learning  outcomes move from understanding the familiar to the general, from  understanding family stories and the heritage around them to a more  general national and international historical engagement. For example,  in Level 1, one of the outcomes is that ‘Students describe their past  and their future using evidence from familiar settings’ (TCC 1.1). By  Level 3, students are expected to ‘create sequences and timelines  about  specifi c  Australian  changes  and  continuities’  (TCC  3.2).  By   Level 6, students are expected to ‘produce a corroborated argument  concerning causes of a change or continuity in environments, media  or gender roles’ (TCC 6.4). In these examples, not only is the context  broadening from the ‘familiar’ to the more remote, but the processes 

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   15 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   15 3/08/2006   8:54:59 3/08/2006   8:54:59

 16

 involved are becoming more sophisticated - from ‘describe’ to ‘create  sequences and timelines’ to ‘produce a corroborated argument’. 

 Comment

 In summary, through its required and suggested content, the SOSE  Syllabus provides scope for teachers to adopt Australian topics when  designing  their  programs.  On  the  other  hand  taught  content  might   vary widely from school to school.

 Interestingly,  and  unusually,  the  Queensland  History  Teachers’   Association  is  supportive  both  of  the  SOSE  approach  and  of  the   interdisciplinary New Basics framework. QHTA members were heavily  involved in the development of the Queensland SOSE 1-10 Syllabus  and of the Senior Syllabuses in Modern History and Ancient History  and this might explain why QHTA promotes the curriculum framework  in its professional development programs, its resources development  and in its publications. The HTA’s stated position is that all histories  can be taught successfully within the New Basics framework, as long  as teachers know what they are doing. 

 On  the  other  hand,  a  number  of  concerns  have  been  raised  by   teachers about a lack of clarity regarding educational standards and  the quantity of required material in the current curriculum, suggesting  that the complexity of the current New Basics curriculum framework  is  confusing  and  burdensome.  Accordingly,  a  new  Queensland   Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting (QCAR) Framework based on  Essential Learnings and Standards framework is to be implemented  by 2008. 

 It will be interesting to see to what extent the new Queensland  Curriculum,  Assessment  and  Reporting  (QCAR)  Framework  will   change the current educational approach in this state.

 A Practitioner’s View

 “Nowadays History is subsumed within SOSE almost everywhere  in Years 1-10. The upside is that all kids get some History this  way  up  to  Year  10.  The  downsides?  …  two  mainly.  First,  the   majority of my SOSE colleagues aren’t ‘History literate’ - even  if they’re SOSE-trained. (In pre-service, History is just one bit  of  the  overall  SOSE  picture.)  Second,  it’s  harder  to  construct   a coherent, in-depth History experience for students when the  SOSE program has to address all those other elements in the  syllabus. It can be done, but takes careful planning. 

 The same’s true for an ‘Australian focus’. Australian examples  abound in the SOSE syllabus - but often as ‘suggestions’ only  -  so  again  it’s  a  conscious  effort  to  select  Australian  content   carefully  so  that  the  kids  can  grasp  the  overall  chronological  

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   16 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   16 3/08/2006   8:54:59 3/08/2006   8:54:59

 17

 fl ow of Australia’s history as well as delve deeper into topics that  particularly excite them (like the Vietnam War and the Franklin  Dam campaign). 

 The  primary  school  scene  worries  me  a  bit.  Students  arriving   in  Year  8  complain  about  having  ‘done’  the  explorers,  the   Aborigines and the Gold Rushes year after year. The syllabus  structure means that shouldn’t happen. I guess it results from  SOSE  being  a  ‘poor  cousin’  to  English  and  Maths  in  primary   schools,  and  teachers  not  giving  it  enough  attention.  And,  of   course,  it’s  hard  for  a  primary  teacher  to  be  ‘across’  all  eight   Key Learning Areas. One primary teacher told me that her entire  exposure  to  ‘History’  in  her  primary  SOSE  training  at uni  was   three  hours  -  one  lecture  and  one  workshop.  No  wonder  the   kids’  stories  remind  me  more  of  old-fashioned  Social  Studies   than of an inquiry-based SOSE approach.

 There  are  promising  signs.  Some  Year  8s  arrive  with  glowing   reports of ‘investigating’ Australia’s past, handling artifacts and  documents,  role-playing  historical  characters,  having  heated   debates about (for example) Ned Kelly. I suspect their teachers  are  the  ones  who  grabbed  the  new  Commonwealth  History   Project resources.”

 The Background

 In 2002, South Australia adopted an Essential Learnings curriculum  model  as  outlined  in  the  South  Australian  Curriculum  Standards   and  Accountability  framework  (SACSA).  The  SACSA  Framework   emphasises  5  Essential  Learnings  for  South  Australian  students,   which provide the over-arching guide for curriculum development and  design. They are: 

 â¢  Futures  

 â¢  Identity

 â¢  Interdependence

 â¢  Thinking

 â¢  Communication.  

 These Essential Learnings form  a basis for all areas of the school  curriculum in South Australia, including historical knowledge.

 The place of history

 History  in  South  Australia  is  taught  primarily  through  Society  and   Environment  (SOSE  equivalent).  This  means  that  there  is  no  set   approach for the teaching of history topics. According to the SACSA  framework, “Society and environment is informed by such subjects as  history, geography, social studies, economics, politics, legal studies,  religion  studies,  environmental  education,  Aboriginal  studies  and   Asian studies. Both integrated and subject discipline approaches can  be used to deliver this curriculum”.

 Based on the 5 Essential Learnings, the SACSA Framework provides  the curriculum framework for students K-10. The SACSA Framework  contains 5 curriculum standards, which mark the end of Years 2, 4, 6,  8 and 10. To achieve a standard, each student must have met all the  outcomes in all strands for a particular Learning Area. 

 In  other  words,  the  current  South  Australian  framework  is  both   outcomes  and  standards-based.  Students  are  encouraged  to  be   “active”  in  their  own  learning,  using  an  outcomes-based  approach,   but  the  framework  stipulates  educational  standards  that  must  be   monitored,  judged  and  reported  on  at  regular  intervals.  Below  is  a   table which shows how the curriculum unfolds:

 SOUTH AUSTRALIA (SA)

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   18 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   18 3/08/2006   8:54:59 3/08/2006   8:54:59

 19

 Early years  (R-2) Children explore their family, community, local  environments and society, in order to understand 

 the common threads in human experiences  which shape individual and collective identities.

 Primary years Students investigate earlier times to gain a  general understanding of Australia’s history and  diverse heritage in the context of signifi cant  world events.

 Middle years Students investigate and analyse events,  ideas, issues and lives of people in their local  community, nation and the world, identifying  patterns, changes, continuities and possible  futures.

 Senior years Students critically analyse continuities and  discontinuities over time, and refl ect upon  the power relationships which shape and are  shaped by these.

 Learning outcomes increase in complexity and depth as the students  complete each standard so that students are taught a range of historical  content  and  skills,  such  as  distinguishing  between  primary  and   secondary sources, understanding chronology and time, evaluating  documents, presenting research, and so forth. Yet historical content  is not defi ned, and there seems to be signifi cant scope for repetition  in the SACSA Framework. 

 Interestingly,  in  the  post-compulsory  years,  Australian  Studies  is   compulsory in Year 11 (without it, students cannot receive the South  Australian Certifi cate of Education). Australian History and Modern   History are elective subjects in Year 12. Students taking Australian  History may do one or two units in the subject.

 Australian History 3-10

 There  is  no  detailed  curriculum  requirement  and  no  particular   timetable allocation for Australian history.

 Although there is no prescribed historical knowledge within the  curriculum, there are suggestions about how to meet the outcomes  through a variety of teaching areas. Within Society and Environment,  Time,  Continuity  and  Change  is  the  primary  point  of  departure  for   teaching historical content and skills. Yet Place, Space, Environment,  Societies also  has  a  signifi cant  component  of  historical  knowledge   (for  example,  the  impact  of  natural  resources  and  geography  on   Australia’s history). Similarly, Cultures and Social Systems includes  Australian  political  history,  such  as  understanding  democracy  and  

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   19 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   19 3/08/2006   8:54:59 3/08/2006   8:54:59

 20

 political systems.

 In  the  primary  years  (3-5)  the  framework  covers  a  wide  period  of   history, but has an emphasis on Australian material. Topics to study  include  pre-contact  Australia,  exploration,  colonisation,  convicts,   Indigenous resistance, as well as change in Australian society (eg the  gold rushes, Federation, voting rights for different groups, migration,  war).  It  uses  this  Australian  perspective  as  a  basis  for  developing   historical understanding and linking this to wider events in the past. 

 The middle years of schooling (6-9) build on this national knowledge  by moving from an emphasis on Australian content to wider regional  and world perspectives.

 In  Year  10,  students  may  deal  with  Australian  national  identity  and   migration under the outcomes for that level.

 Comment

 As there is no requirement that Australian history be taught as part of  a discrete discipline, nor identifi ably within a SOSE strand, it is diffi cult  to generalise about the status of Australian history in schools.

 Interestingly,  South  Australia  has  a  compulsory  Australian  Studies   subject  in  Year  11  and  many  history  teachers  in  SA  are  convinced   that Australian Studies has all but killed off senior school interest in  Australian history. The evidence seems to back up the teachers’ point  of view. In 1993 (prior to compulsory Australian Studies), 1561 Year  12 students took Australian history. In 1998, after the introduction of  compulsory Australian Studies, the number had fallen to 628 although  the total number of Year 12 students had risen by almost a thousand  overall. The 2004 fi gure for Year 12 Australian history in SA is 339.  This mirrors the Victorian experience (q.v.).

 A Practitioner’s View

 “Initially we taught a rote learned narrative in a specifi c subject  labelled History, often for senior classes memorised from a set  of  notes  and  maybe  one  text  book.  Junior  classes  ‘did’  topics   such as Aborigines, Explorers, and the Gold Rushes, again from  one textbook, if they were fortunate enough.

 Over time we were encouraged to include source analysis, and  research  projects,  all  of  which  extended  students  to  develop   a  much  broader  range  of  skills,  including  critical  analysis,   classifying, report writing, debating, making informed judgements  and many others. This was to dramatically improve the teaching  of history in Australia.

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   20 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   20 3/08/2006   8:54:59 3/08/2006   8:54:59

 21

 When history became part of Society and Environment in South  Australia,  the  strength  was  that  all  government  students  were   compelled to do history within this area, as it was the focus of one  of the 4 strands, Time Continuity and Change. History teachers  had signifi cant input into this strand and history obviously is part  of the other 3 strands as well. History was no longer an elective  as it had been in many schools. The weakness [of S&E] lay in  the lack of chronology in curriculum planning in some schools.  However it is clear in the framework, that traditional topics such  as  Australian  Federation,  Australia  at  War,  the  Gold  Rushes   were all included. Having access to a number of schools present  curriculum plans, I can see that these traditional topics are all  still taught, almost to the point where they are ‘Done to death’.

 That  is  why  it  is  so  refreshing  for  students  and  staff  to  have   benefi  ted  from  the  signifi  cant  materials  from  the  National   History Website. Thus in addition to the traditional topics, we  have suggestions for the inclusion of new relevant, vibrant and  critical topics, and also a wonderful selection of resources with  which to teach both the old and the new. 

 It would be heartbreaking and extremely retrograde if we were  to return to a content only, single narrative in the teaching of our  discipline. All the worthwhile development of skills, the raising  of consciousness about values, the rich and abundant units of  work and web resources would be lost. The loss would be for  students, which ultimately means for society at large.”

 Background

 Tasmania  recently  moved  to  an  Essential  Learnings  Framework   (ELs)  for  years  K-10  as  a  response  to  curriculum  overcrowding  in   schools, and perceived lack of student engagement. This framework  emphasises  learning  skills  over  content  and  sets  out  5  Essential   Learnings: Thinking (inquiring and refl  ective thinkers), Communication  (clear and effective communication), Personal Futures (self-directed,  ethical),  Social  Responsibility  (responsible,  active  citizens),  World   Futures (local and global environments). 

 This  framework  is  both  outcomes  and  standards-based,  with  the   Essential Learnings containing a set of student outcomes, which are  marked against 5 standards as students move through their schooling.  (The standards are set at the end of Kindergarten, and then years 2,  5, 8, and 10.)

 The  ELs  framework  represents  a  substantial  shift  away  from   prescribed  content,  which  the  department  felt  lacked  relevance  for   Tasmanian  students.  The  Tasmanian  Essential  Learnings  do  not   prescribe historical material to be covered or approaches to be taken.  However,  within  the  curriculum  framework,  some  historically-based   support  materials  are  being  developed  for  teachers  to  use  to  help   them meet the outcomes and standards of the new framework.

 The place of history

 While historical thinking has a presence in the Tasmanian Essential  Learnings  framework,  actual  content  relating  to  Australian  history   is  not  stipulated.  Skills  of  inquiry,  of  research,  communication  and   literacy form the basis of this framework but there is no essential link  between content and skills. 

 In  primary  schools,  history  is  embedded  in  a  ‘transdisciplinary’   approach  throughout  the  curriculum.  History  is  taught  through   Studies of Society and Environment in most high schools, although  some offer history as a discipline. SOSE is taught as an integrated  or multidisciplinary subject, often incorporating fi elds such as history,  geography and sociology. As long as the Essential Learnings are met,  the actual formation of history is not stipulated—hence some schools  still maintain a discipline approach in the compulsory secondary years,  while others continue to teach historical content through SOSE.

 In the  senior  secondary  years,  SOSE  also  provides  the  organising   structure  for  the  humanities  and  social  sciences  curriculum  for   the  Tasmanian  Certifi cate  of  Education,  but  through  a  discipline   approach.  Subjects  such  as  World  History,  Ancient  Civilisations,   Australian  Studies,  Australia  in  Asia  and  the  Pacifi c,  and  Issues  in   Society all have historical perspectives and themes as their central  or secondary focus.

 Australian History 3-10

 There  is  no  detailed  curriculum  requirement  and  no  particular   timetable allocation for Australian history.

 The  current  Tasmanian  curriculum  framework  represents  a  move   away from prescribed content - in any discipline. As far as Australian  history  is  concerned,  there  are  certainly  topics  that  are  naturally   suited  to  meeting  a  particular  Essential  Learnings  outcome.  For  

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   23 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   23 3/08/2006   8:55:00 3/08/2006   8:55:00

 24

 example, teaching the Eureka Stockade would be useful a topic for  students  to  meet  one  of  the  outcomes  in  Standard  4  (year  8)  for   Acting Democratically: ‘Evaluate the effectiveness of methods used  by democratic popular movements to achieve change’. An outcome in  Standard 4 for Understanding the Past and Creating Preferred Futures  is  to  ‘Demonstrate  the  signifi cant  contributions  of  key  individuals,   groups  and  events  in  shaping  our  nation:  e.g.  Charles  Perkins,   federation,  migration.’  In  other  words,  these  content  examples  are   suggested rather than prescriptive.

 Comment

 This  is  a  strikingly  different  curriculum  approach  to  the  more   prescriptive  or  recommended  content  frameworks  offered  in  some   other  jurisdictions,  particularly  that  of  New  South  Wales,  and  there   has been some teacher, union, business and parental resistance to  its apparent complexity. A new Minister of Education, David Bartlett,  has  promised  (30/6/06)  an  overhaul  of  the  Essential  Learnings   framework,  including  dropping  the  title  but  retaining  the  fi ve  ELs   components. His view is “we did not do a very good job (of ELs)”. The  18  Key  Elements  are  scheduled  for  reduction  and  a  more  subject-based approach is on the cards.

 A Practitioner’s View

 “History is taught through two avenues in Year 7 - 9. It can be  seen as a multidisciplinary approach where SOSE endeavours to  encompass Australian and Environmental studies, incorporating,  Geography, Economics, Business Studies, Civic and Citizenship.  We have a very rich Tasmanian history - both indigenous and  early settlement focus, which informs and enriches our curricular  through out the high school years.

 We are also fortunate to have many trans-disciplinary programs,  which  endeavour  to  engage  students  in  experiential  learning   across  the  curricular,  including  History.  SOSE  is  compulsory   during years 7-9 and we undertake 3 one-hour lessons a week.  In Year 10 there is a specialisation of SOSE and students can  opt for a more in-depth study in Religion, Geography, and History  course.  These  courses  are  very  well  patronised  by  students,   who  later  go  on  to  study  Humanities  based  subjects  at  TCE   Year 11-12 level. Assessment documentation is constructed in  consultation  with  State  requirements  and  school  objectives.  A   nine  criteria  based  assessment,  which  informs  our  evaluation   of the student, does not unduly impede upon the content of the  courses taught, although we do have SOSE Course Outlines for  all Year groups in the high school, which guides our teaching.

 The SOSE course in the school that I teach encourages students  to gain knowledge and understandings of the society in which  they live, other societies / cultural groups, as well as local and  global  environments.  We  endeavour  to  develop  a  student’s   knowledge of Australia, its people; it’s cultural and environmental  heritage, its political and legal systems. We attempt to promote  the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that enable students to  participate as active and inform citizens in a democratic society  and within a global community … In Year 10 History (Optional in  Year 10) we primarily take an Australian perspective, undertaking  an  intellectual  journey  through  our  rich  19th  -20th  C  narrative,   steeped in change through confl ict. We chronologically conduct  a  journey  through  dates  and  times,  incidents,  events,  war   campaigns,  Australian  and  World  leaders,  political  and  social   turning points in Australia. And although perhaps described as  a structured narrative, chronological in nature, there are many  opportunities to stop and engage in critical thinking - historical  signposts one can fl ag down and hang a greater understanding;  a comparative understanding or issue relevant to today’s world.

 I  don’t  believe  that  collaborative  engagement  of  curriculum   content in the areas of social or environmental studies or using  comparative cultural evidence to engage students in discussion  and thought is devaluing or detracting from Australian history, if  anything it actually adds understanding and meaningfulness to  our student’s identifi cation of Australia. How could one study the  effects of the Gold Rush without looking also at the change of  land usage or the social consequences of racial confl ict at the  time? Or when investigating the social and political implications  of Post-War Australia in the 1940’s, you may include the effect  to migration and subsequent issues involving refugees in today’s  society. It would be a disservice to our students if we were not  capable or willing to offer them the opportunity to make links to  some greater issues and associations to their own world - fi nding  relevance amongst the rich primary evidence, basic knowledge  of events and times and to make connections. It would also be  amiss not to engage students in this open dialogue, to put ‘us’  into  a  perspective  and  engage  a  critical  evaluation  of  how  we   have become who we are - this is where one can diverge from a  linear narrative and cast a critical, if not more engaging debate on  who we are, why and how … We need to have rich and relevant  curriculum  that  engages  our  students.  We  need  to  encourage   the critical thinker who is able to evaluate, analyse, interpret, as  well as see the loaded and biased constructions of history and  engage in the discussion. Therefore content is may not always  be as signifi cant as the way it is taught, because if it is taught  in a way that engages then we produce life long learners who  continue to question and refl ect beyond the classroom.”

 The Background

 In 2004, the state government announced that the then Curriculum  and  Standards  (CSF)  2  framework  was  to  be  replaced  by  the   Victorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS). Ostensibly, a change  was needed because the previous, outcomes-based framework had  become over-crowded with outcomes. Figures that were mentioned at  the time were 747 CSF outcomes K-10 and 2192 indicators (detailed  suggestions  about  how  outcomes  might  be  achieved).  Arguably,   VELS  was  introduced,  in  part,  because  outcome  based  education   in Victoria had developed into a school-level tick-a-box approach to  student achievement. 

 VELS identifi es establishes three strands and sixteen “domains” as  the basis of the whole curriculum. The strands are:

 â¢  Physical,  Personal  and  Social  learning,  which  includes,  for   example, Civics and Citizenship Education

 â¢  Discipline-based  learning,  which  includes,  for  example,   English

 â¢  Interdisciplinary  learning,  which  includes,  for  example,   Communication and Thinking processes

 The Place of History

 History is a “Domain” within the Discipline-based Humanities “strand”.  The other VELS strands are Arts, English (with Languages other than  English), Mathematics and Science. The other Humanities Domains  are Geography and Economics. The nature of the domains is further  expanded in “Dimensions”

 Specifi  c  standards  for  Economics,  Geography  and  History  are   introduced at Level 4 (Years 5 and 6).

 The history domain of the Victorian Essential Learning Standards will  be introduced into all Victorian Government and Catholic schools in  2007.

 The  major  change  brought  about  by  the  introduction  of  VELS  is   that  history  is  now  a  clearly  defi ned  discipline  at  both  primary  and   secondary school levels, with its own clearly outlined attributes and  its own content. 

 Under the previous curriculum framework it was possible for a student  to reach Year 10 without having attended a “history” lesson. That is  no longer the case. Furthermore, all schools now have to report to  the state department on the teaching and learning of history, which  was not the case before. On the other hand, the implementation of  VELS has been handed over to the schools and, that being the case,  History will probably be taught 2 lessons a week in Years 7-8 and at

 best an averaged 3 lessons a week in years 9 and 10 (the subject  could be semesterised, hence the use of “averaged”).

 Finally,  there  is  a  focus  on  Australian  History  in  the  origins  and   establishment of a democratic parliament in the Civics and Citizenship  domain at Level 5. This might include students explaining “the origins  and features of representative government” in other societies and its  “key features”, comparing this society with the system of government  that operates in Australia.

 Australian History 3-10

 There  is  no  detailed  curriculum  requirement  and  no  particular   timetable allocation for Australian history.

 Primary School

 Level 3, in VELS terminology, starts at Grade 3 and ends at Grade  4.  In  that  time,  students  “are  introduced  to  basic  concepts  related   to  history…Specifi c  learning  focus  statements  and  standards….are   introduced  at  level  4.”  There  are  no  specifi c  instructions  regarding   Australian history. Students are also introduced to the language  of  history  and  historical  concepts  such  as  time,  past  and  present,   chronology and change.

 Level 4 (Grade 5 - 6)

 History  in  Grades  5  and  6  means  “signifi cant  events  in  Australian   history”.  Students  examine  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander   (ATSI)  communities  ‘in  the  past  and  as  enduring  cultures  today’,   European settlement, colonial development, the history of the wool  industry,  gold  rushes,  self  government/Federation,  and  World  War   One, as well as the histories of cultural groups that make up Australia  today. At the same time, students examine the history of one Asian/ regional nation and they compare and contrast “values and beliefs of  Australians and peoples of other cultures.”

 Secondary School 

 (Year 7 and 8 students focus on ancient and medieval societies)

 Level 6 (Years 9 and 10) 

 Students return to issues in Australian history with a particular focus  on events which contributed to Australia’s social, cultural and political  development.  They  study  such  topics  as  the  impact  of  European   colonisation  on  Australia,  growth  of  the  colonies,  self-government/ Federation, World Wars One and Two, immigration and the Gulf Wars.  They  also  look  at  the  impact  of  colonization  on  ATSI  communities,   civil  rights,  land  rights,  political  rights  and  social  rights  movements   (eg aboriginal suffrage/Mabo/eight-hour day/womens’ rights).

 Comment

 The major change, as already stated is that history is now regarded  as a discipline. As for Australian history, allowing that there seems  to  be  considerable  repetition  and  overlap  between  Level  4  (upper   primary) and Level 6 (mid-secondary), the difference between how  Australian history is studied a Level 4 and Level 6 seems to lie in the  depth of critical response, the more complex nature of the topics and  the more sophisticated level of explanation required from the senior  students. This is presumably based on Bruner’s spiral theory of the  curriculum (same topics, more depth as student progresses) but in  practice, the theory may be overwhelmed by vicissitudes in practice.  Unless  it  is  handled  properly,  inexperienced,  unqualifi ed,  under-resourced teachers of history (and their students) might well regard  the secondary school phase of Australian history as mere repetition.

 On  the  other  hand,  according  to  a  former  senior  manager  in  the   Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority:

 “The argument (at consultation meetings) was put that it didn’t  really make sense to restrict level 4 to 19th century history and  level 6 to 20th century history because students at level 6 are  much more advanced intellectually and are more mature. They  are able to engage with the material at a much higher level and  with  more  depth.  Students  at  level  4  study  history  in  a  fairly   superfi cial way - primary students spend most of their time on  literacy and numeracy and sport they have little time for anything  else. I heard a fi gure of 8 hours a week for everything else. Some  students get very little history. Anecdotal evidence suggests that  some get no history in some years in the primary school.

 Which is a commonly held view in many jurisdictions, an issue  highlighted in the National Inquiry report.

 Finally, as an indicator of the position of in Australian history at  the senior school level, total Year 12 Victorian student numbers  in history have been slowly rising over the past decade and  a half, from 5579 in 1993 to 6700 in 2005. However students  taking  Australian  history  at  Year  12  have  declined  over  the   same period, from 3143 to 1693. Arguably this phenomenon is  a consequence of (1) the introduction of compulsory Australian  Studies in Victoria at year 11 in the early 1990s. Following this  initiative, Year 12 Australian history in Victoria went into steep  decline, from 3143 in 1993 to 2308 in 1998 (Victoria abandoned  compulsory Australian Studies in the 1995) and (2) the popularity  of the Year 12 ‘Revolutions’ course.”

 A Practitioner’s View

 “The  fi rst  draft  of  the  History  Domain  for  the  VELS  seemed   to  be  less  specifi c  and  in  terms  of  the  content  for  Australian   History, less repetitious. The main point being that teachers felt  aggrieved  by  the  fact  that  the  fi rst  draft  for  Level  Six  did  not   contain  scope  for  events  like  ‘The  Gold  Rushes’.  It  appeared   that the writers had intentionally tried to avoid overlap of content  of ‘Australian History’ at Levels 4 and 6 by generally focusing the  earlier level on the 19th century and the latter on the twentieth.  The  revised,  and  fi nal,  version  though  saw  that  this  idea  of  a   clear-cut distinction between the two centuries was dismissed  -  with  Level  6  clearly  dealing  with  events  from  the  nineteenth   century. 

 To some, this seemed an unwise idea - it was the same content  being  covered  at  both  levels  -  certainly  one,  albeit  not  the   strongest, argument for why some students feel that ‘they have  done it all before’. To be fair though, it does depend on the actual  teaching of the topic to see an actual difference in a student’s  knowledge and understanding of the topic. Good teaching will  challenge and enhance a student’s understanding of a topic and  at  Level  6  teachers  are  directed  to  challenge  students  in  this   way by getting them to use much more sophisticated levels of  analysis to see this type of understanding effected. 

 A  main  concern  though  is  that,  within  the  scope  that  VELS   allows,  particularly  at  Level  6,  [Australian  history]  will  be   whittled down to a mere survey of topics that ‘have been done  before’. At Level 6, VELS certainly allows for many interesting  topics to be incorporated into part of the teaching and learning  program - particularly many events which have contributed to  the  ‘development  of  social,  political  and  cultural  development’   of Australia in the latter part of the twentieth century and indeed  the  twenty-fi rst  -  but  whether  these  will  actually  be  tackled,   especially when examples seem to focus on the ‘old chestnuts’  of the past, is doubtful. 

 VELS expects and allows development of the skills required for  historical understanding and interpretation. It will be interesting  to  see  whether  this  potential  diversity  of  topics  in  Australian   History will be taken up by those using the VELS curriculum.”

 The Background

 Western  Australia’s  Curriculum  Council  has  demonstrated  a  very   strong commitment to outcomes-based education, an approach that  has, over the past few years, put it odds with several teacher groups,  parent groups, media outlets and politicians who have claimed that  WA’s 1998 Curriculum Framework is virtually content-free. This tension  has resulted in considerable local controversy which intensifi ed 2005-2006 when WA-style outcomes-based education was applied for the  fi rst time to senior year students studying for their Tertiary Entrance  (TEE) programs.

 The place of history

 History is studied mainly through the Time, Continuity and Change  SOSE Learning Area section of the Curriculum Framework document,  along with Investigation, Communication and Participation, Resources,  Place  and  Space,  Culture,  Natural  and  Social  Systems  and  Active   Citizenship. SOSE is one of eight Learning Areas.

 The  introductory  sentence  to  the  one  and  a  half  page  section  on   Time,  Continuity  and  Change  reads:  “Students  understand  that   peoples’ actions and values are shaped by their understanding and  interpretation of the past.”

 There is some reference to historical topics in Culture - as diverse  cultural heritages and background to confl ict and tensions

 Australian History 3-10

 There  is  no  detailed  curriculum  requirement  and  no  particular   timetable allocation for Australian history and there is very little direct  reference to Australian history in the Learning Area statement apart  from passing mention of “cultural, political and economic perspectives  on Australia’s past”, heritage and ATSI places of signifi cance and the  Mabo decision. 

 In  the  Curriculum  Council  “Scope  of  the  Curriculum”  section  (pp.   266-270) there is a statement for Years 3-7 that “The development  of  student’s  (sic)  understanding  of  time,  continuity  and  change  is   achieved  mainly  through  Australian  history  (p.  269).  There  follow   two extended paragraphs with suggested topics which include local  history,  indigenous  history  and  examination  of  “British,  or  other   European  and  Asian  beliefs  and  customs”  and  the  “impact  of  the   beliefs and traditions on Australian institutions and practices.”

 There is support material in the form of Getting Started, a 76 page  Learning Area Support Document which outlines case studies at  various stages in a student’s career. Case Story 2 deals with a Year 6  class and an integrated approach to ANZAC Day, using A Fortunate 

 Life as a starting text, examining social and cultural issues in Australia  pre 1914.

 Comment

 This is a very process-driven approach, and, as with other non-prescribed curricular models, what actually goes on in schools K-10 is  hard to fathom. At the same time, WA has fi ve Learning Areas which  equate to the 1990s Key Learning Area “strands” and, as the National  Inquiry pointed out in 2000, this multiplicity of outcomes strands often  results  in  curriculum  confusion.  As  the  teacher  comment  suggests   (below) teachers of Australian history may be tempted to design their  teaching around available resources rather than around a coherent  view  of  the  subject  area.  At  the  time  of  writing,  the  WA  Premier   has  engaged  in  a  trouble-shooting  exercise  over  the  outcomes-based issue. 

 A Practitioner’s View

 “There are overlaps, gaps and repetitions galore in the teaching  of Australian history in Western Australia. 

 Students are repeatedly exposed to ‘Australians at War’ topics  because  of  the  accumulation  of  free  teaching  resources  from   governments over the years, the lack of a syllabus or prescribed  sequence of Australian topics for K to 10, the annual compulsory  school  ceremony  for  ANZAC  Day  which  provides  stimulus  for   class  activities,  and  the  various  competitions,  some  of  which   offer winners overseas trips. 

 In  primary  schools,  history  is  a  small  part  of  the  Society  and   Environment  learning  area  and  is  frequently  integrated  with   other learning areas, in particular English. The marking rubric  for a history topic usually meets the needs of English and the  strands of Investigation, Participation and Communication (ICP)  in  addition  to  needs  of  history.  An  example  is  a  student  task   of learning about John Forrest and then writing his biography.  The  teacher’s  marking  rubric  for  this  task  would  have  some   assessing  lines  for  the  Time,  Continuity  and  Change  strand,   but  also  lines  for  English  competence  in  spelling,  grammar,   punctuation, and using capital letters. If students were required  to  investigate  Forrest’s  explorations,  parts  of  the  Place  and   Space  strand  might  have  appropriate  lines  on  the  rubric  also.   English competencies will be assessed a number of times in a  year, but any form of history will not. In many ways this type of  integration is happening in lower secondary classes also.

 In Primary school little history is taught as teachers are focused  on meeting the needs of literacy and numeracy directives and  benchmark testing. What Australian history students investigate  is limited and has a mainly military focus. Ancient Egypt is still  the popular and common history topic. 

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   31 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   31 3/08/2006   8:55:01 3/08/2006   8:55:01

 In  lower  secondary  school,  students  cover  one  or  both  of  the   world  wars  from  an  Australian  perspective  as  well  as  non-Australian  history.  No  wonder  many  groan  and  say,  ‘Not   Australian history again!’

 At the senior level, 3000 students select history in Year 11 but  only a handful study an Australian history area. 2850 students  have to study a semester of Australian history in Year 12 and  approximately 1800 will study both wars again. However, recent  T.E.E. papers have shown a good standard of knowledge.”

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   32 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   32 3/08/2006   8:55:01 3/08/2006   8:55:01

 33

 If  this  exercise  is  about  assessing  whether  or  not  there  is  a   consistent  and  coherent  approach  to  the  teaching  and  learning  of   Australian  history  in  schools  across  Australia,  two  conclusions  are   immediately clear.

 To  begin  with,  there  is  absolutely  no  consistency  of  curriculum   approach. Two jurisdictions (Western Australia and Northern Territory)  have  adopted  a  state/territory  wide  outcomes-based  framework   within which Australian history is situated as part of SOSE but even  within this small sub-group of two, NT has leaned towards Essential  Learnings. One jurisdiction (Australian Capital Territory) has a similar  outcomes-based approach but has adopted a school-based curriculum  framework and is about to adopt Essential Learnings. In other words,  there is no jurisdictional map of how Australian history should be, or  might be, taught across the ACT. Three jurisdictions (South Australia,  Tasmania  and  Victoria)  have  adopted  an  Essential  Learnings   approach but the current Tasmanian framework is content free, the  South Australian approach has some dispersed content requirements  and the Victorian approach is discipline-based at primary/secondary  levels, with carefully arranged Australian history requirements. New  South Wales operates a discipline-based approach at the secondary  school level, has mandatory timetable requirements, a clear syllabus  outline  and,  uniquely,  an  examination  in  modern  Australian  history.   Queensland has an outcomes-based approach in an Essential  Learnings framework and a reasonably clear set of guidelines for the  teaching of Australian history but within a very complex system, and  uniquely, no public examination system at any level.

 As for detecting any coherence in delivering Australian history in both  syllabus  construction  and  implementation,  there  are  several  issues   which have been highlighted in this survey and which were originally  outlined in the National Inquiry. First there is the problem of generic  SOSE  or  Essential  Learnings  curriculum  in  which  history  can  lose   its  identity  as  a  unique  and  complex  discipline.  In  that  context,  the   permissive nature of the generality of primary school teaching means  that  individual  teachers  call  the  shots  about  what  exactly  is  taught   and when. This means that tracking Australian history in almost all  primary  schools  as  a  defi ned  sequence  of  key  topics  would  be  an   impossible  task.  This  issue  is  extending  into  the  lower  reaches  of   secondary education as the middle years curriculum takes hold in an  increasing number of schools.

 Second, primary school teachers frequently have to give precedence  to  system  priorities  (for  example  literacy  and  numeracy)  at  the   expense of less central Key Learning Areas such as SOSE (or S&E,  HSIE  or  Humanities)  within  which  Australian  history  is  taught  in   all jurisdictions.

 CONCLUSION

 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   33 HistorySummit_DESTMapping_004.indd   33 3/08/2006   8:55:01 3/08/2006   8:55:01

 Third, and this is true for both primary and secondary schools, we  have teachers taking “history” sessions or lessons who have little  or no background in the subject and who may fail to understand the  nature of the discipline. 

 Then there is the problem of topic repetition, with Australian topics  appearing  at  several  stages  in  a  student’s  career,  in  a  way  that  is   frequently detrimental to student interest in the national story. 

 The upshot is that there is no guarantee that the vast majority of students  in Australian schools will have progressed through a systematic study  of Australian history by the end of Year 10. Indeed, the opposite is  almost certainly the case. By the time they reach leaving age, most  students in Australian schools will have experienced a fragmented,  repetitive and incomplete picture of their national story. 

 The  redeeming  feature  of  this  survey  is  that,  in  schools  all  over   Australia,  it  is  evident  that  there  are  large  numbers  of  individual   teachers  at  both  primary  and  secondary  school  level  who  teach   Australian history with great skill and enthusiasm, but many of these  teachers have to operate within a local patchwork curriculum where  Australian history is often regarded as an optional extra.

 Electives - an attempt to encourage Year 9 and 10 student interest by  offering elective units in non-core learning areas. The consequence  is that some students may progress through Years 9 and 10 without  studying any history units.

 .Essential Learnings - an attempt to deal with the problems both  of  an  over-crowded  curriculum  and  preparation  for  life  beyond  the   school walls. The issue of relevance, a key part of educational design  over the past half century, is turned around in Essential Learnings.  Instead of asking, “How can we make the curriculum more relevant to  the outside world?”, the Essential Learnings question is “How can the  challenges of the outside world be met by the curriculum?” Essential  Learnings  has  been  adopted  in  varying  forms  over  last  fi ve  years   in Queensland (as New Basics), Northern Territory, South Australia,  Tasmania and Victoria. It is about to be adopted by ACT.

 Integrated  Curriculum  -  studying  topics  or  themes  in  a  way  that   incorporates  elements  of  the  different  subject/curriculum  areas.   For example students may study Ned Kelly as an exercise involving  outcomes in geography, economics, sociology, morals, media, music,  literature as well as history. Primary school teaching throughout  Australia is fi rmly based on the integrated curriculum model.

 Key Learning Area - a curriculum classifi  cation. In the case of history,  the subject is confl ated into a Studies of Society and Environment Key  Learning Area with “strands” (q.v). There are eight Key Learning Areas:  English/literacy;  Mathematics/numeracy;  Science;  Creative  Arts;   Languages other than English; Studies of Society and Environment  (or S&E/HSIE); Health and Physical Education; Technology.

 Levels  -  developmental  stages  in  a  student’s  career  that  are   broader than Grade or Year levels and are related to standards i.e.  student attainment.

 Middle  School  initiative  -  an  attempt  to  deal  with  transition  from   primary to secondary school, a stage at which many students appeared  to lose interest in their schooling. Generally operates at Years 7-9 and  features integrated approach to curriculum and reduced numbers of  teachers dealing with any class - more like a primary school model.

 Objectives-based  education  -  curriculum  outlined  as  a  series  of   syllabus  goals  without  necessarily  suggesting  how  they  might  be   attained.  Objectives-based  education  tended  to  focus  on  content   only and was criticised for being too narrow and too irrelevant. Now  regarded as passÃ©

 A SHORT GLOSSARY OF USEFUL  EDUCATIONAL TERMS

 Outcomes-based  education  -  a  US  model  curriculum  initially   outlined  as  a  series  of  expected  knowledge/skills  outcomes.  The   curriculum is then developed backwards from the outcomes including  suggested content, combined with elucidatory suggestions on how  outcomes  might  be  achieved.  Became  the  dominant  approach  in   Australia  in  the  1990s.  Criticised  for  being  (1)  too  concerned  with   process (2) too vague on content and (3) too mechanical.

 Semesterisation - teaching a subject in one semester only instead  of over a whole year. This allows non-core subjects to have more  teaching  time  per  week.  For  example,  the  normal  whole  year   allocation for Year 8 history might be two lessons per week, whereas  a  semesterised  Year  8  history  might  have  four  lessons  per  week,   allowing teachers more time for a thorough exploration of topics.

 Standards -  a  commonly-used  term  that  has  two  quite  different   meanings. The fi rst usage relates to student attainment. The second  meaning is to do with the professional capability of teachers.

 Strands - the term can have several meanings but generally refers  to a re-grouping of subjects within a Key learning Area. For example  SOSE  has  at  least  three  strands,  Time  Continuity  and  Change   (history), Place and Space (geography) and Resources (economics).  One jurisdiction had six SOSE strands in its 1990s framework

 Stated  curriculum  -  what  curriculum  documents  say.  This  is   sometimes at odds with enacted curriculum (what actually goes on  in schools) and realised curriculum (what students actually do, or do  not, learn).

 Research into student understanding of  historical narrative

 There has been a signifi cant amount of valuable research in history  education over the past two decades. Most of the key researchers  work  in  Canada,  the  United  States,  the  UK  and  Spain.  Below  is  a   summary of selected research f i ndings as they apply to student  understanding of historical narrative:

 Depth as well as Breadth

 Denis Shemilt conducted the major initial evaluation of the Schools  Council History Project (later known as the Schools History Project  or SHP) and the research conclusions, published in 1980, still remain  one of the most signifi cant contributions to understanding how school  students understand history. The SHP model, a two and a third year  program (Years 9-11 equivalent) combined an initial history-as-enquiry  section with a survey over time (The History of Medicine) and several  studies in depth (for example, “The American West”). Some of the  deeper studies had a brief internally-relevant chronological review. 

 1000 students were surveyed, divided 50:50 into project and control  groups,  using  matched  pairs  analysis  of  a  total  of  306  students  in   the  sample  body.  The  research  looked  into  student  development   of historical thinking in adolescents, ranging from Level 1 - events  happened  “just  because”  through  to  Level  IV  -  a  sophisticated   understanding that historical explanation is constrained by context.  The  highest  success  rate  at  Level  IV  occurred  in  68%  of  the  SHP   students  and  in  29%  of  the  non-SHP.  The  conclusions?  Student   understanding of history improves dramatically when they are taught  the basics of historical enquiry and when they combine depth with  breadth. Finally, a large majority of SHP students (75%) thought history  was harder than mathematics and, conversely, the majority of control  students (83%) thought mathematics was harder than history.

 Stages in understanding

 Peter  Lee  (University  of  London  Institute  of  Education)  has  been   working on historical understanding in students for over thirty years.  His many publications tend to be a re-working of his ideas over time  but he has contributed a useful table of progression in students’ ideas  about [historical] accounts and their relation to the past. The table is  more ability-related than age-related.

 The past is fi xed, it’s  a given Stories are about the same thing: the  story is about something ‘out there’

 The past is inaccessible  We can’t know. We weren’t there.  Nothing can be known for sure

 The past determines  its stories

 Stories are fi xed by the information  available. Differences in accounts are  a consequence of gaps in information

 The past is reported in a  more or less biased way Differences in accounts are a result of  distortion not just lack of information

 The past is selected  and organised from a  viewpoint

 Stories are written from a legitimate  viewpoint held by the author.

 The past is  reconstructed in answer  to questions framed by  historians. Accounts are  constructions, not just  conjunctions of events

 It’s not just the author, it’s also the  nature of the accounts that produces  differing explanations

 An index of historical literacy 

 This very brief outline has been taken from the National Centre for  History Education website (www.hyperhistory.org) where more details  of this important statement of what constitutes historical literacy may  be found in Making History, a guide to the teaching and learning of  history in Australian schools.

 ï¿½ Events  of  the  past  -  Knowing  and  understanding  historical   events, using prior knowledge, and realising the signifi cance  of different events.

 ï¿½ Narratives of the past - Understanding the shape of change  and  continuity  over  time,  understanding  multiple  narratives   and dealing with open-endedness.

 ï¿½ Research  skills  -  Gathering,  analysing  and  using  the   evidence (artefacts, documents and graphics) and issues of  provenance.

 ï¿½ The language of history - Understanding and dealing with the  language of the past.

 ï¿½ Historical concepts - Understanding historical concepts such  as causation and motivation.

 ï¿½ ICT  understandings  -  Using,  understanding  and  evaluating   ICT-based historical resources (the virtual archive).

 ï¿½ Making connections - Connecting the past with the self and  the world today.

 ï¿½ Contention and contestability - Understanding the 'rules' and  the place of public and professional historical debate.

 ï¿½ Representational  expression  -  Understanding  and  using   creativity in representing the past through fi lm, drama, visual  arts, music, fi ction, poetry and ICT.

 ï¿½ Moral  judgement  in  history  -  Understanding  the  moral  and   ethical issues involved in historical explanation.

 ï¿½ Applied  science  in  history  -  Understanding  the  use  and   value  of  scientifi c  and  technological  expertise  and  methods   in  investigating  the  past,  such  as  DNA  analysis  or  gas   chromatography tests.

 ï¿½ Historical explanation - Using historical reasoning, synthesis  and  interpretation  (the  index  of  historical  literacy)  to  explain   the  past.  Historical  understanding  is  incomplete  without   explanation.

 National Consistency in Curriculum Outcomes Draft Statements of Learning for Civics and Citizenship

 The draft Statements of Learning for Civics and Citizenship have been  designed to describe progressions of learning that are accessible and  challenging at four year junctures of years 3, 5, 7 and 9.

 The National Statements will identify some common elements in all  curriculum policies for Civics and Citizenship across Australia, which  will provide a common basis for education systems to develop greater  consistency. The Statements of Learning will be implemented across  all States and Territories by the beginning of 2008.

 The draft Statements recognise that civics and citizenship aspects of  curriculums in Australia seek to provide students with the opportunity  to  develop,  inter  alia,  “an  understanding  of,  and  commitment  to,   Australia’s democratic system of government, law and civic life”; “the  knowledge, skills and values that support active citizenship and the  capacity to act as informed and responsible citizens”; “an appreciation  of  the  infl  uence  of  media  and  information  and  communication   technologies on the views and actions of citizens and governments”  and  “an  understanding  of  historical  perspectives  on  Australia’s   development as a democratic nation”.

 The Statements are intended for use by jurisdictions, not schools.

 Overview

 The Historical Perspectives sections in the draft statements explore  the impact of the past on Australian civil society. The impact of British  colonisation  on  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  peoples  and   their  pursuit  of  citizenship  rights  are  examined.  The  ways  in  which   individuals,  events  and  popular  movements  have  infl uenced  the   development  of  democracy  in  Australia  and  the  infl uence  of  past   societies on Australian democracy are explored. The infl  uence of local,  state, national, regional and global events, issues and perspectives on  Australia’s changing national identities and the impact of government  policy on the development of Australia as a culturally diverse nation  are examined.

 Year 3 Historical Perspectives

 Students  explore  perspectives  on  Australia’s  civic  past  through   symbols, events and personal and group stories. They understand that  Australia’s history pre-dates British colonisation and can recognise  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infl uences on the valuing and  naming of Australian places. They explore Australia’s cultural diversity  through personal and local histories and discuss stories of signifi cant

 events and individuals that have helped shape Australia’s democracy.  They identify and consider the values refl ected in Australian national  symbols.  They  examine  the  infl uence  of  different  types  of  rule  on   people’s lives.

 Year 5 Historical Perspectives

 Students explore ways in which Australian identities have changed  over time. They explore the social organisation of Australia’s Aboriginal  peoples prior to 1788. They investigate why Australia was colonised  by  Britain  and  how  Australia  was  governed  from  colonisation  to   federation. They understand that some important concepts and civic  terms in Australian democracy are legacies of past societies. They  investigate the infl uence of signifi cant individuals and events on the  development of democracy in Australia. They examine the histories of  cultural groups within their community and investigate ways in which  cultural diversity has infl uenced Australian identity over time.

 Year 7 Historical Perspectives

 Students  explore  the  impact  of  people,  events  and  movements  of   the past on Australian identities and democracy. They consider the  importance  of  ‘country’  to  Australia’s  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait   Islander  peoples  and  investigate  how  their  lives  were  affected  by   British  colonisation.  They  investigate  key  events  and  ideas  in  the   development  of  Australian  self-government  and  democracy.  They   consider the changing values refl ected in national celebrations and  examine  what  these  have  meant  to  Australians  over  time.  They   investigate the contributions of people who have helped achieve civil  and political rights in Australia and around the world. They compare  the governance of some ancient societies to that of Australia today.

 Year 9 Historical Perspectives

 Students explore how and why civic and political rights, government  policies  and  national  identity  have  changed  over  time  in  Australia.   They  develop  an  understanding  of  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Islander   people’s  pursuit  of  citizenship  rights  and  examine  the  effects  of   government policies on Australia’s Aboriginal people. They investigate  the  development  of  multiculturalism  in  Australia  and  evaluate   changes  in  government  policies  on  issues  including  immigration.   They  consider  the  development  of  Australian  citizenship  over  time   and reasons why people choose to become Australian citizens. They  have an understanding of Australia’s development as a self-governing  nation from colonisation to the present and the achievement of civil  and political rights in Australia. They refl ect on the infl uence of past  international events on governments in Australia.
