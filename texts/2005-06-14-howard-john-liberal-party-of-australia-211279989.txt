 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA 

 

 Subjects: tax cuts; mandatory detention policy.    

 E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 (inaudible) pleased that the tax cuts will go through?    

 

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 Very pleased but more importantly 10 million Australian taxpayers will be pleased.  Mr Beazley’s been thoroughly sidelined, he’s made himself irrelevant. The reality  always was ultimately the tax cuts would go through, it was a question whether small  business would be messed around. I mean we’ve had hundreds of thousands of small  business people having to load two sets of schedules on to their computers I mean this  is ridiculous. This is displaying hostility towards the running of small business in this  country, no wonder the Labor Party is so out of favour with the small business men  and women of Australia.   

 JOURNALIST:     

 Prime Minister we could still have a situation where the legislation is blocked but the  tax cuts go ahead can’t we?    

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 Yes but the Commissioner has said that he will act upon the statements that have been  made and will therefore advise people to make the deductions in accordance with the 

 new schedules and if the Bill is knocked over it will be restored when the Coalition  has control of the Senate and 10 million Australian taxpayers will cheer that Coalition  control of the Senate.    

 JOURNALIST:     

 Where do you see the outcome of the Petro Georgiou bills Prime Minister?   

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 Oh look our position has not altered, we won’t be changing the fundamentals of our  mandatory detention policy but I’ve always said that if opportunities present  themselves to administer that policy more flexibly and sensibly then we’ll do so and  I’ll continue to talk to my colleagues. I take the view that people within the Liberal  Party are entitled to be heard and as leader of the Party I will spend time listening to  them and talking to them but I am not going to compromise a very good policy but  there could well be ways without compromising the policy of making it work a little  better and a little more flexibly and if there are ways that that can be achieved well  why shouldn’t we, because the fundamentals of the…   

 JOURNALIST:     

 There is still a chance?    

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 Well let’s say there’s always the prospect of resolving difference when people  continue to talk to each other but the fundamental is that the policy, the framework of  the policy is not going to change, we’re going to keep mandatory detention but there  are ways, particularly having in mind the position of children and the time, sometimes  things take, there are ways in which we can make it work better but…   

 JOURNALIST:     

 So you’re willing to change, make changes in those areas?   

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 No I am willing make any adjustment that will make the policy work better, that  doesn’t undermine the fundamentals of the policy and that’s always been my position  but I am not going to go into the detail of that because… 

 

 JOURNALIST:     

 So you won’t explain what those…   

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 No, no, no, I am not because we are still having discussions.    

 JOURNALIST:     

 The Bills are being introduced on Monday, will you let them be debated?    

 PRIME MINISTER:     

 Oh look I am not going to talk about that, thank you.
