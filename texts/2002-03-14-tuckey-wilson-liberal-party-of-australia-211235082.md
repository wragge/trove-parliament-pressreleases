 MEDIA RELEASE

 Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government WILSON TUCKEY

 14 March 2002 WT09/2002

 SNOWDEN STILL DODGES THE QUESTION OF HIS PERSONAL POSITION ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND

 The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Wilson Tuckey, said today that the Federal Member for Lingiari, Warren Snowden whose electorate includes the territory of Christmas Island is still dodging the question of his support for the new detention centre on Christmas Island.

 Mr Snowden in a series of points of order, a parliamentary speech, a press release and a personal explanation in the House of Representatives was at great pains not to state his personal support for the creation of a permanent detention centre on Christmas Island.

 His press release was a carefully constructed effort to undermine the almost unanimous support for the development amongst the residents of Christmas Island.

 I was available at a public meeting and a number of private meetings on the island last Tuesday and no one except the Union secretary whose offices Snowden uses when he visits the island raised any of the issues that the member mentions being communicated to him.

 I will not hold my breath in awaiting Snowden's categorical personal support for the project or the Howard Government's policies on asylum seekers.
