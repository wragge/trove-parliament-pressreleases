 Media Statement  Friday 1st June 2007

 PM’s ignorance on migrant health makes me sick: Bartlett   

 Democrats Immigration spokesperson, Senator Bartlett has again condemned the Prime Minister’s continuing  statements about locking the nation’s doors to refugees and migrants with serious communicable diseases as  simply politically motivated ignorance.   

 Mr Howard has been reported today as supporting a ban on migrants and refugees who were HIV positive or  who had leprosy from entering the country.    

 “I have consistently supported this government’s large expansion in the number of migrants and long-term  residents Australia is receiving, but it is irresponsible that at the same time as bringing in record numbers of  people, Mr Howard repeatedly and willingly stokes community ignorance about alleged health risks from 

 migrants,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The Prime Minister is clearly under extreme political pressure, but that is still no excuse for failing to use facts  and reason when formulating policy, rather than resorting to ignorance and talkback driven agendas.”   

 “There are literally millions of people entering Australia each year as tourists or other visitors. Is the Prime  Minister suggesting they should all be screened for health risks, or is he just going to pick on the easy target  and vilify a small group of people whose health conditions we are already aware of?”   

 “Action should be based on evidence, rather than ignorance or prejudice, and it should be consistent rather  than deliberately stigmatising one or two groups of people.”   

 “There is absolutely no evidence to support this grossly unfair targeting of migrants and refugees as a health  threat or to justify the consequential drain on the public health purse,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
