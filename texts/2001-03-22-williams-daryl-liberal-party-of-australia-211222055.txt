 Government to continue with ART proposal

 The Government will continue with its plan to reform the merits review system and establish the Administrative Review Tribunal.

 On 26 February 2001, Labor and the Democrats blocked the passage of the ART legislation through the Senate. That legislation would replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Migration Review Tribunal with a single, independent tribunal to review administrative decisions on their merits.

 The legislation aims to replace slow, legalistic and unnecessarily adversarial and expensive merits review with a better, more accessible and affordable system. The Government will continue to consult various interest groups about amendments to the legislation that will enable its passage through the Parliament, while still meeting those aims.

 Because of the delay in the passage of the ART legislation, there is now no prospect of the ART commencing operation on 1 July 2001 as planned. The Government will, of course, make appointments and reappointments to the existing tribunals to ensure the continuity of those tribunals. When considering the membership of the AAT, I will be taking into account the longer term goal of establishing the ART.

 Pending the establishment of the ART, the tribunals and relevant departments will be identifying and implementing measures that will achieve greater efficiencies in the administration of the tribunals.

 I remain hopeful that Labor and the Democrats, who have indicated their support

 for tribunal amalgamation, will support the passage of amended ART legislation.
