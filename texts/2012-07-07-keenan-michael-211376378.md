 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling PEOPLE SMUGGLERS SEND ANOTHER  VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN LABOR INACTION July 07, 2012

 The arrival of the latest illegal boat, with 31 people on board, shows people smugglers continue to take advantage of Julia  Gillard’s refusal to act to restore the border protection policies that Labor abolished, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Two years ago yesterday Julia Gillard promised she would break the people smugglers’ business model by building an  offshore processing centre on East Timor. Since that time she has overseen the largest number of illegal boat arrivals  under any Prime Minister with 206 boats and over 13,600 people arriving on her watch," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Rather than restore the policies that worked - offshore processing in Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning boats  back where it is safe to do so, Julia Gillard has stumbled through policy failure after policy failure and has now created a  committee solution as an excuse not to restore these policies," he said. 

 "And there is still no terms of reference for her proposed multi -party committee more than a week since it was announced  despite repeated requests from the Coalition. 

 "Australia’s borders are being overseen by a weak Prime Minister. No multi -party committee is required to restore the  measures that worked to stop illegal boat arrivals and end the chaos and tragedies on our borders. 

 "The government, Greens and Independents voted against Coalition attempts to find a consensus in the Parliament on  offshore processing. If the government won’t re-open Nauru now they can vote for the Coalition’s bill to allow offshore  processing in any of 147 other countries that have signed the UN Convention or its Protocol. 

 "The Government blaming the Coalition for its own border failures will not stop the boats," Mr Morrison said.
