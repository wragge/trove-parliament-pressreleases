 GOVERNMENT MUST RATIFY TORTURE PROTOCOL   

 Australian Greens in the House of Representatives and the  Senate have demanded that the government rejects a  recommendation from the Joint Standing Committee on  Treaties that opposes ratifying the Optional Protocol to the  Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or  Degrading Treatment or Punishment.   

 “The Protocol is simply designed to prevent Torture and Other  Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, by  providing for independent inspections of detention facilities.”  Cunningham MP Michael Organ said.    

 “What is wrong with improving human rights in Australia?    

 “The Greens can only conclude that the reluctance to ratify the  Protocol is a result of the Howard government’s indifference to  human rights in Australia, including the inhumane detention of  asylum-seekers in desert prisons, and the government’s complicity  in the continued unlawful detention of David Hicks and Mamdouh  Habib by the US military.”   

 “The Committee’s majority finding flies in the face of seventeen of  the twenty submissions it received on the issue, so I and my Senate  colleagues have prepared a Notice of Motion demanding that the  government ratify the Protocol immediately”, Mr. Organ said.
