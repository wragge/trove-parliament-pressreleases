 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 More talk won't stop the boats as the 90th illegal boat arrives 

 Friday 12th March 2010 

 The arrival of the second boat within as many days shows that more talk from Mr Rudd 

 about people smuggling will not stop the boats coming to Australia, according to Scott 

 Morrison, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Michael Keenan, Shadow 

 Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection.  

 

 “The boats don’t lie. They are a continuous reminder of the Rudd Government’s policy 

 failures and refusal to accept their own responsibilty for a problem of their own making,” Mr 

 Morrison said.  

 

 “People smugglers have wasted no time in sending another message to the Rudd 

 Government. Ninety boats have now made their way to Australia since the Rudd 

 Government first started rolling back the strong border protection regime they inherited from 

 the Coalition.  

 

 “On this occasion passengers on board the boat had to be rescued, highlighting the perilous 

 nature of these voyages and why it is so important that we stop people from risking their 

 lives in this way.  

 

 “Boats are now arriving at the rate of more than 2 per week in 2010, which is the highest rate 

 on record. At this rate there will more than 100 boats arrive this year, carrying well in excess 

 of 5000 people.  

 

 “The Rudd Government is already secretly preparing to transfer detainees from an 

 overcrowded Christmas Island to Darwin, before they have finalised their asylum claims.  

 

 “This will bring to an end the integrity of Australia’s off shore processing regime that played 

 such a crictical role in stopping the boats in the past. The decision to bring them to the 

 mainland will only further serve to encourage illegal boat arrivals”, Mr Morrison said. 

 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said the 

 Government needed to provide clarity over this latest arrival and confirm under what 

 circumstances the vessel found itself in distress. 

 

 “The Government has claimed this latest interception was a rescue - if that’s the case, then 

 why have they failed to disclose any details?” Mr Keenan asked. 

 

 “Was this a response to a distress call, and if so how were the passengers on board the 

 vessel in distress; who received the call? 

 

 “Who were the passengers on board and where are they from? Why has the Government 

 taken all day to report this rescue? 

 

 “The government continues to hide on the issue of illegal boat arrivals, instead of being 

 upfront to the Australian people about the circumstances of each interception,” Mr Keenan 

 said.
