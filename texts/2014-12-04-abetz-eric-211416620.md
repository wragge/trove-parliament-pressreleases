 MEDIA STATEMENT 

 

 

 4 December 2014 

 

 Senate has important work to finalise this year   

 

 The Government will be proposing that the Senate sits late tonight, to deal with important  legislation before the end of the parliamentary year.   

 Leader of the Government in the Senate Senator Eric Abetz said that there are ten Bills listed  on today’s Senate Order of Business which are all important.   

 “We have important legislation dealing with Labor’s legacy of 30,000 unresolved cases  specifically to get children out of detention and give asylum seekers the ability to work or  study,” Senator Abetz said.   

 “We have legislation reforming tax laws designed to help get the budget back into shape and  authorisation for a loan to the ACT to deal with the Mr Fluffy asbestos legacy.   

 “The Senate needs to make decision with regards these proposed laws before it adjourns for  the Christmas break.”   

 The Australian taxpayer expects Senators to consider legislation responsibly.   

 Therefore Coalition Senators will support an extension to the Senate’s sitting timetable tonight  until 11 pm and, if necessary, reconvening at 9am tomorrow.   

 “We trust there is sufficient support among Senators for these extended hours, so that we can  do the job that Australians pay us to do, and that they expect us to do,” Senator Abetz  concluded.
