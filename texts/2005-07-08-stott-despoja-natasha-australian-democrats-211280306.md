 Visas for Chen Yonglin and Family: About Time

 The Australian Democrats welcome the decision to grant permanent visas to former Chinese consular officer  Chen Yonglin and his family, allowing them to stay in Australia.

 However, Democrats Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said the visas should  have been granted weeks ago and it was unclear why the process had taken so long. 

 "This is precisely the type of case in which political asylum should have been granted immediately, said  Senator Stott Despoja.

 "The delay in granting these visas resulted in Mr Chen and his family becoming extremely anxious and  concerned for their safety which was very clear to me when I met with him recently.

 "The Governments handling of this matter has been appalling. It has displayed an utter disregard for the  immense courage displayed by Mr Chen. 

 "The Australian community has shown overwhelming support for Mr Chen and his family and outrage at the  Commonwealth Governments handling of the matter. 

 "It is disturbing to think what may have happened had the public response not been so strong.

 "Despite this significant victory for Mr Chen and his family, there is still some unfinished business arising from  this case. 

 "The Government must now conduct a thorough investigation into the very serious allegations made by Mr  Chen against the Chinese Government. 

 "At this pivotal time when we are in preliminary negotiations for a free trade agreement with China, the  Australian community has a right to know if Chinese officials are harassing and spying on people within our  own borders.

 "The Government should seize this opportunity to send a clear message to China. We must not compromise  our position on human rights and we must not tolerate the violation of these rights within Australia," said  Senator Stott Despoja.
