  Media Release

  ILLEGALS COST TAXPAYERS 
TENS OF MILLIONS IN ACCOMMODATION AND LEGAL COSTS

  

  People with no right to be in Australia were exploiting Australia’s 
judici al system and placing a significant burden on our detention 
centres, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, said today.

  

 Mr Ruddock said there were some 1,036 people currently 
in detention of whom 230 were able to pursue judicial action. Of this 
230, 60 per cent were, or have been, involved in some form of legal 
action to delay their removal from Australia.

  

 “Despite lodging applications that were rejected 
by both my department and the Refugee Review Tribunal, 137 people in 
detention have taken this judicial route.

  

 “The Australian taxpayer not only pays the legal 
costs for these people, but has to house, clothe and feed them while 
they pursue such claims.

  

 “Last year Australia spent some $22 million on administrating 
and operating these detention centres. In addition, the taxpayer may 
be forced to pay a staggering $20 million in litigation costs by the 
year 2002 if the Senate fails to pass the Judicial Review Bill.”

  

 Mr Ruddock said seventy per cent of total litigation 
costs related to people whose refugee claims had been rejected and who 
then sought recourse through the courts.

  

 “In 1997-98 there were 1,045 applications to the 
Federal Court seeking judicial review of migration decisions. In the 
financial year to date 1,148 new actions have already been lodged.

  

 “When you consider that 47 per cent of these applicants 
withdraw their actions prior to the hearing it is clear judicial avenues 
are increasingly being used as nothing more than weapons of delay.

  

 “Swift action is clearly needed to ensure passage 
of the Judicial Review Bill to restrict the endless opportunities for 
court action and appeal by people with no lawful right to remain in 
Australia.

  

 “The Australian Labor Party needs to stop playing 
politics with this crucial issue and act in Australia’s best interests.”
