 MORE MIGRANTS TO BENEFIT AUSTRALIA

 Australia plans to take 95,000 migrants in 1986/87, the  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Chris Hurford, announced today.

 This compares with the 1985/86 planned total of 84,000 and  the estimated actual total of 89,000.

 "The composition of the program shows a continuing  commitment to immediate family reunions and refugees for  compassionate and humanitarian reasons, but the additional  numbers are in the category of those this country needs,"  Mr Hurford said.

 "Australia requires more employable migrants to maintain  its economic development and stimulate population growth."

 Mr Hurford said the community required more information  about Australia's need for migrants.  The Government could  best demonstrate the benefits of immigration by careful  selection and by explaining the benefits.

 "More migrants will help to create a larger domestic  market, stimulate trade, facilitate structural change and  provide the potential for Australia to play a positive,  role in the developing South-East Asian/Pacific economy,"  Mr Hurford said.

 "This is supported by the recent study undertaken by my  Department and the Committee for Economic Development of  Australia (CEDA)," he said.

 "More migrants will also help to offset Australia's low  natural birthrate, the loss of permanent residents -  including young skilled people - leaving Australia, and an  ageing population. We would probably have a declining 

 - or at best static - population by the middle of next  century if we don't increase our intake numbers."

 Mr Hurford said most of the increases in the migration  program would come from a new migrant category, Independent and Concessional, based on the principles of  the current extended family (Category C) program. This 

 new category would include further extended family, such  as nephews and nieces, and also enable those without  family to apply for entry. Only those who can score high  points by being young and employable will be able to come 

 to Australia through a necessarily selective approach.

 "We take all the unskilled we can absorb under the  immediate family reunion and refugee parts of our  program," he said. "We are keeping the planning level for  refugees and special humanitarian cases unchanged at 

 12,000. Skilled migration will increase - from a planning  level of 14,000 this year, to 16,000 - to fulfil a  continuing need for people with certain special skills  where it is not possible to train or retrain people who  are here sufficiently quickly. Business migration will be  promoted more strongly because this also creates more jobs.

 "Next year's program is a further development of the  successful changes I introduced in 1985 to maximise  benefits to Australia while maintaining a commitment to  humanitarian needs," Mr Hurford said. "The more we can  make our immigration program aid our economic growth, the  more positive we can be with the socially-based part of 

 our program in later years."

 BACKGROUND TO 1986/87 IMMIGRATION PROGRAM

 The planning level of the 1986/87 Migration Program is 95.000 persons, compared with the announced program of 84.000 for 1985/86 and the estimated actual total of 89.000 (see Attachment table).

 Economic benefits

 More migrants can help to create a larger domestic market,  stimulate trade, facilitate structural change, and provide  Australia with the potential for a positive role in the  developing regional economy of SE Asia and the Pacific 

 Basin. The' recent study undertaken jointly by the  Department and the Committee for Economic Development of  Australia on the economics of immigration supports this  rationale.

 More migrants will stimulate population growth, and help  to offset Australia's low fertility, loss of young skilled  emigrants, and an ageing population. Our population would  probably be in decline, or would at best remain static,  during the next century if we did not increase the 

 immigration intake.

 The program is carefully balanced to reflect economic,  social and humanitarian values. In achieving the  increase, however, Australia has to be selective in order  to maximise benefits and to make immigration more popular  with the broader community.

 New migrant category â 

 The major policy change will be to introduce a new  'Independent and Concessional' category from 1 July 1986.  The new category will be based on the principles of the  current extended family (Category C) program. The object 

 is to extend the pool of eligible migrants to more  extended family members such as nephews and nieces, and  those with no family in Australia.

 Employability and benefit to Australia will be essential  for selection'. All applicants will be assessed against  the current points system, which selects in favour of the  young, skilled, educated and employable. The pass mark  will be increased to 70 points; but concessionary points  will be given to brothers and sisters and non-dependent 

 children (10 points) and nephews and nieces (5 points) in  recognition of the economic support that can be given by  existing family in Australia. So the points requirement  will, in effect, remain the same for brothers and sisters  and non-dependent children.

 The bulk of the program increase will come from this  category not only in 1986/87 but also in successive years.

 Extending eligibility in this way is expected to be  welcomed by the many young, skilled, educated people who  want to settle in Australia and have much to offer the  nation,  but have hitherto been ineligible.

 At the same time,  by giving explicit weighting to the  value of having family already in Australia and extending  eligibility, migrant communities should also welcome the  change. Older communities should welcome the extension of 

 sponsorships to nephews and nieces and the fact that those  overseas compatriots without family to nominate them may  now qualify to come here.

 The estimated total is 25,000 persons for this category in  1986/87. Of this, probably around 15-20,000 will be  brothers and sisters. In future years, as the category  expands, more distant family members and independent  applicants will increase their shares of the total.

 The estimated outcome for 1985/86 is 28,000, larger than  planned,  caused by both larger-than-estimated carryover of  old policy cases and higher interest than anticipated 

 under the new points system.

 Family reunion

 The Government maintains its commitment to meeting social  and humanitarian needs.

 The reunion of close family - spouses, children ana  parents - is well accepted.  In effect, entry is allowed  to all who are eligible, subject in most cases only to  health and character checks. Demand in recent years has  been relatively stable. Therefore an estimated 26,000  visas could be issued in 1986/87, compared with an  estimated outcome of 25,000 in 1985/86. A sensitive 

 element is the Vietnam program, which relies on the  co-operation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  Government.  It must be emphasised that 1  family1  to us is  the Australian immediate family (i.e. spouses, children  and aged parents). People who migrate have no rights for  the entry of more extended family members,  although,  unlike the United States and Canada, we do allocate bonus  points for some extended relationships.

 Refugees

 Planning levels for the Refugee and Special Humanitarian  Programs will be maintained at 12,000 persons. This is a  balanced program reflecting changing needs.  There is a  minor decrease in need for resettlement of Indochinese,   particularly Vietnamese; a minor increase in the East  European caseload, particularly in Southern European  countries of first refuge;  and a largely stable level of  need in other areas’  These assessments have been made  within the context of the Government's overall emphasis on  solutions other than resettlement to refugee situations,  particularly voluntary repatriation.

 In line with the desire to increase community involvement  in humanitarian settlement and to recognise the resource  implications of funding refugee travel to an extent not  undertaken by comparable migrant intake countries such as  the USA and Canada, there will be a change in balance  between cases receiving assisted passages and those paying 

 for their own travel to Australia.

 Skilled migration

 The skilled migration program will increase to 16,000 in  1986/87, compared with a planning level of 14,000 for  1985/86. There is some growth in labour demand which has  led to an increase in the number of unfilled vacancies, 

 especially .for skilled occupations. The effects of the  low apprenticeship intakes in 1982/83 are also now being  felt.

 The Government is committed to domestic self-sufficiency  in key labour market skills in the long term. The aim is  to establish the Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) as the  major mechanism for skilled migration, while retaining the 

 Occupational Share System (OSS) as a reserve entry  mechanism. To this end, the Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs, Mr Chris Hurford, will investigate jointly  with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations 

 the scope for developing ENS in 1986/87 by joint'   negotiated 'industry shares' with selected trade union and  employer groups.

 The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations will  be consulting with business, unions and other relevant  Departments over the next two months in preparing detailed  recommendations on skilled migration intakes by  occupational category (the OSS Schedule).

 Business migrants

 The Government remains firmly committed to attracting  business migrants to Australia.  There is no ceiling to  this category; we will take as many business migrants with  the necessary attributes as we can get.

 The more positive and flexible policy introduced last year  has been successful and there is growing interest in  South-East Asia and Europe. However, the pool of  potentially mobile business migrants is small and 

 competition from other countries is strong. The program  will be promoted more strongly by allocating more  resources, and developing a more concerted and 

 co-ordinated strategy with the wide range of agencies  active in this area.

 The 1986/87 Business Migration Program is estimated at  2,500 visas. The estimated outcome for 1985/86 is 1,800  visas.

 Change of status

 Change of status approvals are estimated at 10,000 in  1986/87, compared with an estimated outcome of 10,500 in  1985/86. Mr Hurford's statement on illegal immigrants of  17 October last year is well understood and accepted, and  entry is now restricted to those with genuine claims.

 Benefits maximised

 The 1986/87 program is essentially a further development  of the rationale of the 1985/86 package of policy and  procedural changes.

 The changes introduced in 1985 have been successful. The  Government's policy is to maximise benefits to Australia,  while maintaining a commitment to humanitarian aims.  Procedures will be as simple and easy as possible to give 

 an efficient service to clients.
