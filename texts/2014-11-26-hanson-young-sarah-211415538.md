 SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 26 November 2014   

 Morrison using children to blackmail Senate  crossbench   

 Scott Morrison is trying to ram a disaster of an asylum bill through the Senate by bullying the  crossbenchers, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Scott Morrison is trying to bully his way through the Senate,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Minister’s intimidation tactics and take it or leave it approach has left hundreds of children  locked in damaging detention.   

 “The Senate and the crossbench have a duty to look at this legislation and reign in his power-grab. It’s not the Senate that’s keeping children locked in detention, it’s Scott Morrison.   

 “This blackmailing from the Minister isn’t winning him any friends in the Senate.   

 “We need to get refugee claims processed and start placing people in the community. The only  way that can happen is with a genuine commitment to permanent protection and, as it stands,  that's not in the bill.   

 “There can be a way through here, but Scott Morrison's obsession with cruelty and bully-boy  tactics aren't helping.”
