 The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release   

 Christmas Island cost blow-out 

 

 Six asylum seeker boats in eleven days carrying 250 people is the clearest evidence yet of  the Rudd Government’s failure to protect Australia’s borders, Shadow Minister for Justice  and Customs Sussan Ley said today.   

 Their border protection policy breakdown is clear with every boat apprehension, yet Prime  Minister Kevin Rudd refused in Question Time today to reveal the added cost burden for  Australian taxpayers.   

 The annual $40 million cost of administering the Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) on  Christmas Island has already been doubled by the decision to double the centre’s capacity at  a cost of $40 million.   

 “Add to this the ongoing costs of administration for the enlarged facility, plus increased  apprehension costs - the annual bill could climb to well beyond $80 million excluding the  additional capital costs, with no solution in sight,” Ms Ley said.   

 Now that the IDC has been put under immense pressure by the flood of new detainees, Mr  Rudd should state clearly the added financial impact of their policy failure.   

 Since the Rudd Government softened Australia’s border protection system in August 2008,  54 boats carrying 2,400 people have been intercepted by the Border Protection Command  (BPC).   

 “That has clear budget implications for the administration of the Christmas Island facility and  requires increased vigilance by BPC when they are already stretched beyond capacity.   

 “It is not good enough for Mr Rudd to brush off the issue given the massive increased cost  that is being incurred daily in attempting to restore an orderly refugee intake policy,” Ms Ley  said.
