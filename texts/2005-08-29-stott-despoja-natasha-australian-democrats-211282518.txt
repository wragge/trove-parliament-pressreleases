  DEMOCRATS  MEDIA (051) EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30PM CST MONDAY AUGUST 29 2005  SENATOR NATASHA STOTT DESPOJA  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA 

  SUICIDE STILL A B I G  ISSUE FOR YOUTH: POLL  Suicide remains a tragedy in young people’s lives, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja’s annual Youth  Poll survey has revealed. 

  Releasing the results of Youth Poll 2005, Senator Stott Despoja expressed concern that more than  half of respondents knew someone who had attempted or committed suicide. 

  “It is disturbing that so many young people have first hand experience of suicide,” Senator Stott  Despoja said. 

  Other major issues for young people this year include: increased university fees (65% say increased  HECS fees will discourage them from attending university); reconciliation (71 % believe the  Government should enter into a treaty with Indigenous Australians); and, access to contraception  (80% want young people to have access to free birth control). 

  “A significantly higher percentage of respondents than last year (60% compared to 42%) do not  support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers. 

  “Young people have once again articulated their scepticism of traditional sources of political  information: the media and politicians. 

  “For more than a decade, Youth Poll has provided young people with a forum to express their views  on a range of topics. 

  “Through Youth Poll, young people’s views are publicised in the media and reported to Parliament,”  Senator Stott Despoja said. 

  This year’s state specific findings include: an overwhelming 85% of respondents from New South  Wales do not support a night curfew for young P-plated drivers; 74% of South Australian  respondents do not support the impounding of cars playing loud music or doing burnouts; and, 71 %  of ACT respondents believe there are not enough services for young people in their Territory.
