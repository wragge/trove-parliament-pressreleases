 LIBERAL/NATIONAL AIDS POLICY LAUNCHED

 "Eliminating the spread of HIV infection and AIDS by means of  ,  education, research and treatment is the principal goal of the  Liberal and National AIDS Policy.

 "Our statement on AIDS is a detailed and considered response to  one of Australia's most serious public health problems.

 "It is a policy for the here and now reflecting what we currently  know about AIDS, and it also a policy for the future.

 "As knowledge and circumstances change, the policy will be  tailored to take account of such fresh developments.

 "In co-operation with State and Territory governments, a Federal  Liberal/National Party Government will work to bring about the  fullest possible range of educative, legislative and other  practical measures which can be used in the fight against AIDS.

 "Mass testing is not advocated at this stage since on any current  cost-benefit analysis it is considered to be both unwarranted and  wasteful.

 "Funds which would have to be directed to support such mass  testing can be spent more effectively in other ways, such as on  better education programs, improved care and treatment, and  medical and social research.

 "Voluntary testing, without legal action or discrimination, will  however be encouraged as a means of assisting those people who  believe they may have been exposed to HIV infection.

 "And if at, some stage.in the future there is evidence that  sentinel testing may assist in planning a national response to  AIDS then we reserve the right to adopt such an approach.

 "Our basic concern is to protect individuals and the community as  a whole and we will take whatever action is necessary to see that  this occurs.

 "The measures which will be pursued in support of this objective  are set out in detail in the policy and in brief in the attached  summary."
