 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 23rd November 2013   

 Nauru no place for children, unaccompanied or not   

 Sending unaccompanied children to a detention camp on a tiny pacific island was always an  unsustainably cruel policy, the Australian Greens have said today.   

 "An unaccompanied teenage girl is being used as political fodder by this government. This cruelty is  unacceptable and has to come to an end once and for all," the Greens' immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 "These are children, vulnerable and alone. They should be looked after, not dumped on a 21 square  km island of rock in the Pacific.   

 "Being sent back and forth between Christmas Island and Nauru, these children are being treated  like human ping-pong balls.   

 "Testing the absolute limits of cruelty and being forced to pull back by basic human dignity is no way  to run Australia's refugee policy.   

 "Offshore processing is never about caring for refugees, but this government's brutal approach is  both unnecessary and inhumane."
