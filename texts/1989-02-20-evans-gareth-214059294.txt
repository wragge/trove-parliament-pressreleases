 A ustralian em ergency assistance to  Kurdish refugees

 Australia will provide $100,000 to Kurdish refugees, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced today.

 The contribution is in response to an appeal from the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for assistance to Iraqi Kurdish  refugees, m any of whom have fled to Iran.

 "Since the cease-fire agreement between Iran and Iraq in September 1988,  some 38,000 Kurds have taken refuge in Iran and a similar num ber are in  Turkey," Senator Evans said.

 Senator Evans said the assistance would be used to buy winter clothes, food  and other essential items, as well as for transportation.

 A ustralian emergency assistance to Kurdish refugees forms part of the  Government's hum anitarian aid program administered by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), Canberra.
