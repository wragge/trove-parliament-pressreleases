 Minister for Children and Youth Affairs

 Media Release

 Providing Local Answers to local problems

 19/08/2004

 Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, today announced a commitment of around $17 million  funding to 93 grassroots projects that will support local answers to local problems. 

 Mr Anthony said funding has been made available through the refocussed $365 million Stronger Families and  Communities Strategy's Local Answers initiative. Local Answers ($60 million over four years) gives communities  the power to develop their own solutions and help them help themselves by supporting locally developed and  implemented projects.

 This approach is recognition that government alone cannot solve community issues and that communities  themselves know what their local issues are, how these issues can best be addressed and who they need to  work with to implement solutions.

 Funding under Local Answers will support projects that:

 â     build effective parenting and relationship skills;

 â     build opportunities and skills for economic self-reliance in families and communities;

 â     build partnerships between local services strengthening support to families and communities, so they 

 deliver better services and meet unmet needs; â     assist young parents in particular to further their education or access to training and other services 

 where they are seeking to make the transition to employment; and â     assist members of the community to get involved in community life through local volunteering, 

 mentoring of young people, and training to build community leadership and initiative.

 "The funding includes $7.3 million in continuing support for 41 projects which were previously funded under the  first four years of the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. Around $10 million will go to new projects  around Australia.

 "In funding Local Answers, the Australian Government is continuing to listen to communities and to trust their  judgment in proposing responses to local issues. We are firmly committed to working in partnership with  communities in a flexible way, so that our children, families and communities will be supported in ways they  need," Mr Anthony said.

 More information about the projects and the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is available on the  FaCS website at www.facs.gov.au/sfcs
