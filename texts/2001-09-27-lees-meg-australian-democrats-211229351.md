 Senator Meg Lees  Australian Democrats

 27 September, 2001        MEDIA RELEASE                   01/570           

 Bill of Rights tabled in Parliament The Australian Democrats today tabled a Private Members Bill (Parliamentary Charter Of Rights And Freedoms Bill 2001), which will enshrine the fundamental rights of all Australians in a Bill of Rights.

 In tabling the Bill, Democrats’ Senator Meg Lees, said that given the Parliament’s latest attempts to water down the rights of refugees as well as the Howard Government’s attack on the UN human rights committee system, an Australian Bill of Rights is more imperative than ever.

 “The Democrats’ Charter is an opportunity to establish a comprehensive human rights standard for Australia,” said Senator Lees.

 “It is the result of extensive community consultation over a 12 month period. If passed, it will mean the biggest single step forward in the protection of fundamental rights that this country has ever seen.

 “The Charter of Rights is an implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It sets out certain fundamental rights and freedoms including the right to equal protection of the law, the right to a fair trial, freedom of expression and freedom of religion.

 “These rights are fundamental tenants of a free and democratic society.

 “The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be empowered to investigate complaints about government practices which may infringe the Charter,” said Senator Lees.

 Democrats’ Leader Senator Natasha Stott Despoja called on the Government to support the Bill.

 “Given that the Prime Minister unveiled the Magna Carta Monument yesterday, which is a tribute to the ancient charter of rights, I urge him to give substance to his gesture by supporting the Democrats’ Bill,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 Senator Lees pointed out that the countries that Australia aligns itself to internationally including the USA, Canada and New Zealand, all have a Bill of Rights but Australia does not.

 “Australians do not have their rights and responsibilities enshrined in our Constitution, which is why we have seen Indigenous people, women and homosexual citizens compelled to seek international help in addressing unjust treatment and discrimination.

 “Last year we saw a sustained attack on the UN Committee system by the Howard Government but if Australia had its own domestic Bill of Rights to protect citizens here, there would be less need to rely on UN human rights treaties and investigative committees,” Senator Lees said.

 “This Bill is ground breaking because it will make fundamental human rights enforceable at a state level for the first time,” concluded Senator Lees.
