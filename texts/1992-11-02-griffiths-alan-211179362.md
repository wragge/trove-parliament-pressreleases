 AUSTRALIA AND THE ASIA PACIFIC: OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE 1990

 Speech by

 on Alan Griffithz MP,

 Australian Minister for Tourism and Resources

 Asia Society Luncheon, Bong tong, 2 November 19n.

 COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY . MICAH

 It is a pleasure 

 to be here in Hong Kong again and to have this opportunity to address such a distinguished audience.

 The theme of my sp(f.ech today - Opportunities in ttc- , 1990s, --highlights the in.;Ir-aaeing engagement of the Australian and Asian economies.

 Within Australia, the.;':‘,1 has been ongoing debate about our place in the Asia Pacific region and the Australian Government's

 efforts to promote greater engagement.

 Some have seen thi',; ls a sign of insecurity in Australian society.

 Most, however, including the Australian Government, regard the debate as pFrt of the process of defining Australia's role into this decade aria beyond 45 a healthy indication of the growth of a confident, new ;kustralian identity.

 In examining the many issues involved, I think it is important to note the â¢gItinst the background of ecsme incontrovertible facts.

 First, it i-..: impossible to dispute that Australia is geographicdI17 part of the Asia Pacific region. Short of a massive movem-.1.tit in the tectonic plates, we will be here for a while yet!

 Nor can tne:e be any dispute about the fact that, depoguphiczili.  Augtralian society is no longer the overwhelmingly Zuropean home-away-from-home it was even thirty

 year ago.

 Indeed, we 'lave benefitted from our generous refugee resettlement policy and Increasing migration from Asia.

 There are now over 600,000 Australians of Asian descent. This is expcnoted to grow to 7% of the population in the next twenty years.

 My own electoral constituency has an Asian population approaching ten percent.

 But perhaps most significant of all for Australia's future - and our role in the region - are the trade and economic realities.

 In just one generation. Asia has undergone a fundamental transformation.

 From a scatter of poor, developing and often unstable economies, it is now the world's most dynamic economic region.

 For the first time in 500 years, the centre of global economic activity is set to return to Asia.

 Trade among the fifteen Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) economies now exceeds trade within the European Community.

 Of even more direct significance to Australia is the fact that over 60% of our exports go to our regional partners.

 Eight of our twelve largest export mar lt-A ,t .z - which include Hong Mang - and eix of our twelve largest import suppliers are within the Asia Pacific region.

 The inescapable conclusion is that Australia's place is clearly in the Asia Pacific region - and our future is inextricably linked to that of our region.

 Public perceptions, both in Australia and elsewhere in the region, are another reality we have to face.

 One example of this is the perception or the Australian economy vis-a-vis the economies of Asia. What is the reality?

 3

 Tha reality is that Australia is the twelfth largest economy in the world; it is around the combined size of tne SIX ASEAN states, and our economic and trade porformance is stronger than

 many in the region.

 The rate of growth, over the past decade, may not have been as spectacular as some in the region, but was substantial nonetheless.

 A further misconception is that Australia is a small power With a modest role to play, both globally and regionally. What is the reality?

 The reality is that Australia is a middle ranking power with an increasingly international outlook.

 Moreover, we can use our location in the Asia Pacific along with our own particular background extremely effectively - to bridge differences both within the region and between the region and the rest of the world.

 Our record in coalition-building and niche diplomacy in a number of fields - Cambodia, the chemical Weapons Convention and APEC to name but a few - has already earned us widespread respect.

 The Government has accepted for many years the conclusion that our future lies in engagement with Asia, as not only an inescapable reality, but a highly desirable objective.

 The most recent, comprehensive restatement of this was made by Prime minister Keating during his visit to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia in September.

 Our trading patterns reflect our increasing engagement with Asia.

 Australian exports have reached rocord levels, despite subdued . world trading conditions .and depressed- commodity prices.

 4

 In the nine months to the end of March 1992 exports were more than 10 per cent above year-earlier levels and growing at four times the world rate.

 The growth in our manufactured export volumes in particular in both 1990 and 1991 was tho fastest of any OBcD country.

 The Asia Pacific region, particularly North Asia and South East Asia, ha g  been of central importance in this strong trade record.

 merchandise exports to South East Asia now exceed those to either the United States or the European Community.

 Perhaps the most pleasing result has been in Elaborately Transformed Manufactures (ETMs) which have grown the fastest of all our exports - over 300 per cent between 1981 and 1991.

 Our fastest growing markets for Australian manufactured goods are in North Asia, with exports rising by more than 700 per cent in tan years.

 The flip side of the coin is a broadening of imports from the region.

 A decade ago, petroleum dominated our imports from South East Asia. Since then, the share of oil has halved to account for around one-third of our total imports from that region.

 Over the same period we began importing a much wider range of manufactured goods from south East Asia. These are now the largest component of our imports.

 A significant factor in this improved trade performance has been Australia's vigorous program of economic reform.

 S

 Australians know that they cannot rely on high commodity prices. We know that wa must earn - not demand - our standard Of living. And we are meeting the challenge.

 Our inflation rate has been slashed. It is now the lowest in the OECD.

 Considerable progress has been made in microeconomic reform - in aviation, the waterfront, communications and electricity - to name just a few.

 Tho emphasis of industrial relations has been shifted toward enterprise bargainina, with productivity taking centre stage. The hundreds of enterprise agreements in place now will become thousands by this time next year.

 New disciplines have been imposed on the public seotor.

 Taxation has been reformed and foreign investment into Australia has been liberalised. ArtifiCial barriers to trade have been removed.  We will work globally (and regionally through, for example APEC) to continue this process.

 Two areas which present enormous opportunities for further trade in the 1990s are resources and tourism - the two portfolio areas represent.

 Australia's resource industries are, I think, universally agreed to be the best in the world.

 Our companies use world best technology working in often harSh environments to produce world competitive products.

 The skills and enterprise of our resource companies are backed by Covernment policies which provide fora clear, predictable and long-term framework for industry development,

 6

 Our policies, for example, for the petroleum sector (which have included the removal of export Controls, the deregulation of the LPC market, the introduction of a resource rent tax and company-wide deductibility for exploration expenditure) have been

 remarked upon by a number of international commentators is the best in the world and a model for other nations to follow.

 Asia, of course, is our major market for resource exports.

 With growth rates in the region roughly double those of the OECD, and energy demand growth expected to average more than 54 par annum (and even more for power generation), thn Australian engagement will only grow.

 As shepherds of the AMC Energy Working Group, we have keen appreciation of the issues confronting our region in tells of energy supplies, energy conservation and the environment.

 Against this background, and given the quality of our industries, reliability of supply, established industrial centres, technological excellence and proximity to our markets, I am

 excited at the opportunities ahead.

 Those opportunities are legion.

 In the energy area, demand for our clean coals and LNC is growing rapidly, as is interest in our continuing rszearch on clean coal technologies.

 With the need for continuing energy conservation and advances in product development, demand for lighter metals - aluminium and magnesium. - will grow, as will the need for increased investment in production in Australia.

 Supplies of steel will be critical in helping meet the infrastructure needs of the region over the next decade and beyond.

 In etwal making, there are promising new devalopments, such as the hi - smelt and directly reduced iron (DRI) technol e ,gieS  in

 which Australian companies are participating with aur regional partners.

 In other areas too, such as fused .aste refractories for the glass industry, and titanium cl -)xide pigment, Australia ham the resources, the technologil and productive capacity, and the

 industrial environment that makes um an even more competitive location for invg-±.-ant

 have to stress, however, that thc energy and minerals policies of the region, especially trt_ding arrangements, will need to complement these opportunities

 Where there are trade impediments, such w", escalating tariff regimes, these will need to be lieralised 'In order to build the

 confidence that is required for future investment, and to obtain the efficiencies and comp,,I .titive edge whic  s possible through Strategic alliances and crâ¢)ss investments within our region.

 Let me take my resoures hat off and put ;:y tourism hat on.

 Over recent times tLe , Imstralian Goverment has put in place a range ot initi T L-,:ives to support and promota our in-bound tourism

 industry.

 As e result, inbeund tourism i g 

 now Austratia's fastest growing

 i:Idustry.

 This year, Mor;_ tan 2.5 million people will visit Australia.

 Foreign exchange earnings will exceed A$9 illicn.  More than A$1400 million is : 4 1 1ing spent overseas by thei. Australian Tourist

 Commiesion on to.l.rism promotion.

 Research shows that in virtually every major market of the world Australia is ro .:. the most preferred destination for travel.â¢

 a

 The objective of our marketing campaigns is to convert this latent demand into firm bookings.

 The Asian market is now by far our largest source of tourists. In total, around 1.2 million people from Asia will visit Australia this year. Japan remains our largest single market, but countries like Singapore, Taiwan and Korea are showing dramatic growth.

 "ay the year 2000 we expect 7 million inbound tourists to Australia annually. with the policy settings we have in place, w4 do not anticipate any difficulties in achieving this target.

 The strong growth in inbound tourism coupled with some exciting opportunities in the accommodation sector means that there has ;lever been a better time to invest in the Australian tourism inaustry.

 We have a shortage of acOOmmodation in some areas, particularly in tha three star and lower categories, while at the same time, five star hotels in some city CBD areas are selling at well below replacement costs.

 Hong Xong, for example, has already established a presence in the Australian tourist accommodation market buying seven properties since the beginning of 1991 at a total value of more than AS220 million.

 Australia welcomes this shared partnership in our tourism industry and looks forward to increased flows of both investment and visitors.

 Let me conclude with these remarks.

 What T have sought to do today has been to describe the major changes under way both in Australia and in our attitude to the -region4 â¢ - - -

 â¢

 These changas are not just rhetoric; they are real: they are measurable.

 Australia is an economy in transition. We have passed the baton to a new generation of political, business and trade union leaders.

 The Australia of old - inward looking, highly protected and overly regulated - is 1=0 gone.

 We still have a way to go to complete the transition to an open, outward looking and internationally competitive economy fully engaged with our region. But we are almost there.

 The degree of positive economic change has been moMentous.

 During the 1980s, industrial disputes in Australia fell to below the OECD average. In 1992, for example, disputes fell to the lowest level in thirty years.

 our inflation rate is the lowest in the OECD. Most importantly, it will stay low.

 13 cakuse of the Government's success in carefully targeting our spending programs, we are now the third lowest taxed country in the OECD. Our tax to GDP ratio is well below the OECD average of :19%, and comparable with the USA and Japan.

 Total exports have doubled mince 1983, and exports now make up almost a quarter of total GDP compared with just 16* at the start of the 1980s.

 We expect economic growth of 3% in 1992/93, with a stronger performance in 2.993/94.

 The bottom tins is that there is a strong complementarity between — -- Australia's economic structure- arid - those - --at -our- regional neighbours.

 There is much to be gained by all partie g  in the region through

 the forging of closer links and the removal or artificial barriers to trade.

 For Australia's part, our future iliac in expanding our engagement with Asia, not as an interloper, but as a natural and cooperative partner.

 It is to that end that I am committed.
