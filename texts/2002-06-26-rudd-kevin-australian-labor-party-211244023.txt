 KEVIN RUDD M.P. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 MEDIA RELEASE

 MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS: THE PATH AHEAD

 President Bushâ€™s statement on the Middle East peace process marks an important step forward in international efforts to find a just and comprehensive resolution to the issues that divide Palestinians and Israelis.

 Labor welcomes the intention of the Bush Administration to engage more directly in the Middle East peace process. What is needed now is a clear statement of the practical measures that can take the peace process forward.

 Labor strongly endorses US support for the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The concept of two states living side-by-side is now widely accepted and a long-standing part of Labor policy. The task for Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the international community is to find practical measures that will achieve that goal.

 Labor also endorses US recognition of the importance of resolving the settlements issue as a necessary element of any durable solution.

 Democracy must be the foundation stone of a new Palestinian state. Labor notes that the Palestinian Council was elected in 1996 (which in turn elected Chairman Arafat) and that the stated intention of the Palestinian Authority was to hold further elections next year.

 It is, however, a matter for the Palestinian people whom they elect through such a democratic process.

 Building stronger democratic institutions will be an important element in the creation of Palestine.

 The central issues of combatting terrorism, settlements, the future of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem are complex, and must be addressed by the upcoming regional ministerial conference as the necessary stepping-stones to a comprehensive solution.

 Ends 26 June
