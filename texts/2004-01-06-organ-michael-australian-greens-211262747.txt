 ***** MEDIA RELEASE *****   

 

 6th January 2004   

 VANSTONE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY  FOR HUNGER STRIKERS   

 The Australian Government has once again failed to honour its obligations in  regard to human rights, Cunningham MP Michael Organ said today.   

 “In an embarrassing letter published in The Age newspaper today, Nauru’s Finance  Minister accuses Australia of breaching its Memorandum of Understanding with  Nauru by failing to provide medical treatment to asylum seekers who are on a hunger  strike,” Michael Organ MP said.   

 “The fact that Nauru’s Finance Minister has had to take such a radical step to capture  the attention of the Australian Government is a sad indictment of the way we are  dealing with our neighbours in regard to this issue.”   

 “The lives of people are at risk and the Government can no longer afford to wash its  hands of their welfare and safety.”   

 “The welfare of these asylum seekers is now clearly in the hands of Minister  Vanstone.”   

 “The Greens call on the Australian Government to allow an independent medical  team to visit Nauru to ensure the ongoing safety and welfare of asylum seekers, as  soon as possible,” Mr. Organ said.
