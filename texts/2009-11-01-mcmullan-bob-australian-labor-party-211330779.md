 MEDIA RELEASE   BOB MCMULLAN MP 

 PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE 

 MEMBER FOR FRASER  

 

 AA 77/09  1 November 2009 

 Travel to Africa   Today I depart Australia to travel to South Africa, Malawi, Uganda and Kenya.

 One of the purposes of my trip will be to strengthen Australia's ties with key  development partners. I will be meeting with government representatives in  Kenya, Uganda and Malawi and with heads of humanitarian agencies  including the World Food Programme and UNICEF.  

 Australia's engagement in Africa is expanding across a full spectrum of issues  including trade and development assistance. Under a new aid strategy for  Africa, Australia will support Africa's progress towards the Millennium 

 Development Goals (MDGs) in areas where we have particular expertise such  as agriculture, maternal and child health, and water and sanitation. 

 I will also visit a refugee camp in Kenya where thousands of mainly Somalian  refugees live, unable to return home due to ongoing conflict.
