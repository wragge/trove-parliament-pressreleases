 PHILIP RUDDOCK Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

 NO ATTACK ON WELFARE POLICY

 I thought the Minister had got the message.

 However, in an election climate his refusal to understand the  responsible and fair proposals outlined in our Economic Action Plan  is indeed predictable.

 The Hawke Labor Government's campaign to misrepresent and grossly  distort Coalition initiatives, is not surprising. A  Government who  know they are on the w a y  out, will go to extraordinary lengths to  "hang on" by misrepresentation.

 As the Minister in his selective press release points out, 95.7  percent of migrants who have been in Australia for 20 years are  members of the labor force, as well as the fact that a majority of 

 "immigrants entering Australia did not go immediately on to  sickness benefits or an invalid pension".

 It is fair to all Australians that the Opposition is moving to  ensure that all who sponsor relatives from abroad honour  commitments given.

 Further, the Liberal and National Parties recognise the enormous  contribution made by families. The Liberal/National Party will  reduce inflation, cut taxes, and bring interest rates down so they  stay down.

 In denying migrants benefits for the first 12 months, there are .   three important elements that should be understood.

 1. People coming to Australia under the Refugee Program, which  includes Special Humanitarian cases, are specifically exempt.

 2. To qualify to come to Australia under the family re-union  scheme, migrants must have assurances of accomodation and  support, given by a sponsoring relative. Our commitment is to  ensure those assurances are honoured.

 / 2

 3. In the area of economic and independent migration, it is the 

 Coalition's view that those seeking to come to Australia should  be capable of supporting themselves for 12 months. Australia  is rich in opportunities for all and gives every individual the  chance to get a job, earn a living and make a successful life 

 here.

 Further, there is provision for the Secretary of the Department of  Social Security to look at individual cases of special hardship.

 Additionally it should not be forgotten that all of the commitments  announced in the "National Agenda for a Multicultural AustraliaH  were left in tact in the Economic Action Plan.

 in light of the Minister's most recent Press Statement (attached)  it's fair to ask why has the Minister waited until now to mount 

 ill-conceived criticisms of our Economic Action Plan J  . .
