 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 NO NEED TO DETAIN CHILDREN IN ORDER TO SECURE BORDERS

 On radio this morning Minister Ruddock claimed that he must continue to detain the Bakhtiyari boys at  Woomera  because of  his  responsibility for border  security and  immigration.   This  is  a  ridiculous claim.  You do not need to detain children in Woomera to secure Australian’s borders.

 The Minister was responding to SA Premier, Mike Rann, who on Wednesday called for the release of the Bakhtiyari boys.  Mr Rann was commenting following a report by child protection officers of the State  Government’s  Family  and  Youth  Services  Department,  which  raised  serious  concerns  for  the welfare of the two boys.

 Whatever view one takes of the merits of the Bakhtiyari family’s claim to refugee status, the children are the innocent ones.  It is not their fault that they have ended up in Woomera.

 If  child  protection  professionals  are  saying  that  the  boys  need  to  leave  Woomera  or  they  will experience  further  harm  then  the  Minister  must  respond.  To  do  anything  else  is  to  show  a  callous indifference to the needs of these children.

 From January this  year,  Labor  has been calling on  the  Howard  Government  to  stop  playing politics with this issue and get children out of high security detention.  Labor’s plan has been endorsed by the Minister’s own Immigration Detention Advisory Group.

 The  Minister  knows  that  he  has  no  credible  arguments  against  Labor’s  plan  so  he  has  constantly sought to disguise the real issue, that children should not be held in high security surroundings.  His latest effort - claiming border security necessitates the holding of children in high security detention - is absurd.

 Since  January  this  year,  Labor  has  been  calling  on  the  Howard  Government  to  get  the  children  out from behind the razor wire by: â¢ Putting unaccompanied minors into foster care; and â¢ By  building  on  the  current  alternate  detention  trial  in  which  women  and  children  are  living  in

 ordinary style  housing under  supervision.   Labor  believes  this  model  could  be used  for  housing family groups and that children living in such arrangements could go to ordinary schools.

 Labor  also  renews  its  call  for  the  closure  of  Woomera.   No  one  should  be  held  in  such  a  facility, especially when the much better $40 million Baxter facility nearby is barely used.
