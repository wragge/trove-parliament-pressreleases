 Press Release Dated: 18 Dec 2000 Press Release Number: 00/759 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Children in detention - Australia’s shame: DEMOCRATS CALL FOR REVIEW OF POLICY The Democrats have welcomed suggestions by the Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock, that he would consider placing families with children, in group homes outside of detention centres.

 “It’s a start. It would begin to move us towards the practices in most other countries,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

 The Democrats also proposed today a maximum six-month period for detention of unauthorised arrivals.

 “Six months is enough time for the Government to assess their refugee status and any necessary medical and security checks,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The Democrats have always argued that mandatory detention for all unauthorised arrivals is unnecessarily harsh.

 “At a minimum, unescorted minors should be released to be cared for by church and welfare agencies in the community,” he said.

 “We don’t put juvenile offenders in adult prisons, so how can we defend putting children who have not been convicted of any crime in mandatory detention centres?

 “Some children are born and raised in detention centres while their parents wait for the Government to decide if they can stay,” he said.

 “Australia is one of the few countries in the world which compulsorily detains all unauthorised arrivals indefinitely.

 “The Labor Party is willing to make mileage out of recent allegations of mistreatment and abuse but the detention policy was introduced by the ALP when it was in Government. It is time for all political parties to reassess their attitude to this inhumane and unnecessary practice," concluded Senator Bartlett.
