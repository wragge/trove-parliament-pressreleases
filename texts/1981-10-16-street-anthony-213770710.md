 UNHCR AWARD OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

 The Minister for Foreign A f f a i r s , the Hon Tony Street   MP, today released the text of a message he sent today on   behalf of the Australian Government to the United Nations High   Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva:

 "My dear High Commissioner

 Please accept the warmest congratulations of the   Australian Government, and my own personal f e l i c i t a t i o n s ,  on   the splendid news that your Office has been awarded the  

 Nobel Peace Prize.

 Situated in a region recently affected by massive  

 refugee flows Australians have been uniquely well-placed to   appreciate the outstanding efforts made by you and your   organization in coping with this tragic problem. W-ithout   UNHCR's valiant and dedicated e f f o r t s , I am sure that the  

 adverse impacts of refugee flows upon individuals and nations   would have been i n f i n i t e l y  greater than has in fact been the  

 case.

 While the prize is a collective one, paying trib ute to  

 the work of successive High Commissioners, Executive Committees   and o f f i c i a l s  over several decades, i t  is en tire ly f i t t i n g  

 and appropriate that i t  should be awarded during your term of  

 o ffic e . The award is in great measure to your exemplary, wise  

 and far-sighted stewardship of the affa ir s of the UNHCR.",
