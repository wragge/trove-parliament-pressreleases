 REPORT ON AUSTRALIA’S  REFUGEE AND HUMANITARIAN SYSTEM

 The challenge for the Prime Minister, in the light of the majority  recommendations on the issue of the PRC students, is to abandon ex-Prime  Minister Hawke's discriminatory policy, where PRC nationals in Australia  prior to the Tienanmen Square massacre were singled out for preferential  treatment.

 There is now truly a bi-partisan approach between Opposition and  Government members forming the majority view of the Committee.

 Prime Minister Keating should demonstrate some flexibility and appreciation  of the long-standing bi-partisan principles of migration and make it quite  clear that in 1994, under either a Coalition or Labor Government the  position will be as recommended by the majority of the Committee. This is:

 the Government end the uncertainty concerning the long term  future of PRC permit holders in Australia by announcing the  arrangements which will be used to differentiate between those  who from June 1994 will be granted permanent residence, those  who mfay be granted a further four year temporary entry permit,  and those who will be returned to the PRC;

 as non-discriminatory criteria are an important principle in  Australia's refugee determination system, from June 1994 PRC  permit holders should be eligible to apply as follows:

 - for permanent residence, on the basis of relevant 

 universal selection criteria; or

 1

 - for cor iinuing protection, to be established on a case by  case basis against internationally accepted criteria.

 to assist in determining whether there is a need for on-going  protection for PRC permit holders, an in-country assessment of

 human rights provisions in the PRC should be prepared for use  by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and  Ethnic Affairs, and assurances should be sought from the  Government of the PRC that those PRC permit holders who  return to the PRC will not suffer discrimination or detention  upon their return; and

 - those PRC permit holders who do not meet selection criteria  should be granted, on expiry of their permits, a short extension  of stay, say three months, to enable them to put their affairs in  order and make appropriate arrangements for departing  Australia.

 The only remaining dissenting voice opposed to restoration of a sensible  approach to this issue is Dr Andrew Theophanus, who seeks:

 a specially designed PRC permanent entry permit; and

 - to accept all PRC nationals who meet a general absorption test.  Further, he would give continued temporary entry to all PRC  nationals until they themselves think it safe to return to China;

 Senator Cooney (ALP) has suggested that those who do not satisfy refugee  or other migration criteria ought to remain as permanent temporary  residents.

 These alternatives would only serve to entrench the discriminatory approach  already taken by Prime Minister Hawke and confirmed by Prime Minister  Keating, and perpetraiB the uncertainty that already exists amongst those  PRC nationals on the existing temporary permit.

 It is clear that the majority view of tour members of the Coalition and three  members of the Government is the more sensible approach and the Prime  Minister should abandon the commitments arising from ex-Prime Minister  Hawke's emotionalism.
