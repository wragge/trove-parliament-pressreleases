  MEDIA RELEASE 

  AUSTRALIA CONTINUES TO SEND WRONG MESSAGE 

  John Howard’s and Philip Ruddock’s reaction to the Tampa incident is yet another  example of Australia sending the wrong message to the world, Member for Throsby,  Colin Hollis said today. 

  Howard and Ruddock say they want the world to know Australia is not a soft touch  for people smugglers, yet all their messages, videos, detention centres, criminal  prosecutions against detainees and now the refusal of a boat to off-load its cargo of  human misery, have failed to slow the stream of people seeking asylum in Australia. 

  More worrying, said Mi- Hollis, is that by refusing these people permission to land,  and indeed rehsing the ship permission to enter Australian waters, it is most likely,  despite the law of the sea that Captains will rehse to pick up people in distress. 

  Does anyone believe that the Government would refbse to allow a ship to off-load 400  European people that had been rescued from a tourist vessel which had been in danger  of sinking? Refbsing to allow this vessel to off-load people it has rescued sends a  message to every Captain on thz high scas that they should let asylum seekers drown  rather than rescue them. 

  Mr Hollis said that the whole Australian detention system was in need of change.
