 JOINT MEDIA RELEASE

 REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT FROM REGIONAL PROCESSING CENTRES   

 The Australian Government has reached a further third country resettlement agreement for refugees  currently in regional processing centres. 

 Resettlement arrangements for those found to be refugees in Nauru and Manus Island already exist with  Papua New Guinea and Cambodia. 

 This further agreement is with the United States and it will not under any circumstance be available to  any future illegal maritime arrivals (IMAs) to Australia. 

 The priority under this arrangement will be for resettlement of those who are most vulnerable, namely  women, children and families. 

 US authorities will conduct their own assessment of refugees and decide which people are resettled in  the US. 

 Refugees will need to satisfy standard requirements for admission into the US, including passing health  and security checks.   

 This process will take time and the resettlement will be gradual.   

 This arrangement is supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and we will  continue to engage with UNHCR on its implementation. 

 We will continue to support the Governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea to return people  determined not to be owed protection. These people should return to their country of origin. 

 The Government is acting decisively to resolve Labor’s border legacy. It has fallen to the Coalition to  stop the boats, close the onshore detention centres and remove children from detention. As a result of  these actions, we are now able to address another stark symbol of Labor’s failure: those illegal maritime  arrivals in regional processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru. 

 Settlement in Australia will never be an option for those found to refugees in regional processing  centres nor for anyone who attempts to travel to Australia illegally by boat in the future. 

 Australia’s border protection policy remains consistent and firm. Operation Sovereign Borders will  continue to turnback people smuggling ventures where it is safe to do so and any illegal maritime  arrivals to Australia will be sent to regional processing centres. 

 The Australian Government has reinforced our maritime assets in the waters to Australia’s north and  increased our surveillance capabilities to ensure that any boats that attempt to come to Australia will be  detected and turned back. 

 Under the Coalition, Australia’s borders are now stronger than ever.
