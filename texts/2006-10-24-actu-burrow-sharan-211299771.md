 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  1 

 A Government Against Its People:  

 Unions Standing up for Respect; Rights and 

 Opportunity   

 ACTU Congress, 24 October 2006 

 Sharan Burrow - ACTU President 

 

 A Government against its own people!  

 

 Increasingly this is the legacy of the Howard Government.  

 

 Punitive welfare to work laws that punish single mothers, the disabled, the 

 sick who are temporarily unable to work or vulnerable workers sacked unfairly. 

 

 Shocking but just one set of wrongs in a sea of damage to the Australian 

 ethos of a fair go. 

 

 The Government has presided over the emergence of a massive shortage in 

 skills while we have unacceptable levels of youth unemployment.  

 

 Rather than provide opportunity and optimism for our young people this 

 Government has systematically put the price of university entrance out of the 

 reach the children of working parents.  Now they have put loans for TAFE fees 

 on the agenda. Our children, Australia’s children deserve better. 

 

 There is silence or lame excuses for the misuse of 457 visas that shame a 

 proudly immigrant nation by allowing our young people to go without work 

 while seeing the sons and daughters of neighbouring countries exploited.  

 

 We have seen the Minister insult the professional work of all teachers in our 

 public schools; disgraceful conservative rubbish designed to distract the 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  2 

 nation from the fact that they have under-funded our schools by $2.9billion 

 dollars.  

 

 Then there is the despair of families over the cost of childcare -  with up to 

 one million potential workers outside the labour force at a time when we need 

 to do all we can to encourage labour force participation.  Investment in quality 

 care that  is affordable, and will reap significant dividends in terms of more 

 workers, increased tax revenue, and early childhood development, but above 

 all it would alleviate real financial stress for families. All it takes is the political 

 will to care for the children of working people. 

 

 Australians are willing to pay for a quality health system in which we all can 

 share yet this Government would rather prop up the profits of an inefficient 

 private health insurance industry than make Medicare work for everyone. 

 

 Public housing is not even on their priority list despite the levels of 

 homelessness and the extreme financial stress of many families living in 

 poverty. And when more than half of generation X, the children of many of us 

 here, say they have given up on the dream of ever owning their own home 

 then surely affordable housing must rate a higher priority than a political swipe 

 at the State governments. 

 

 Infrastructure, industry policy, innovation - all suffering neglect with our 

 exports of high end manufacturing falling into negative territory, a record low 

 of -0.2% in 2005 — down from almost 18% in the mid-nineties. And our 

 Research & Development is less than three quarters (72%) of the OECD 

 average.  

 

 The Government’s neglect in these areas means the loss of jobs, the loss of 

 decent jobs for our future and an economy that is increasingly dependent just 

 on what we can dig up and sell while we import all the smart stuff. 

 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  3 

 Fifteen years of solid economic growth has been squandered by the Howard 

 Government. 

 

 For this Government too, climate change is a political battle against the global 

 commitment that signing the Kyoto Declaration represents, the Government 

 does not a serious commitment to rescuing the health of the planet.  The 

 impact of water shortage and the challenge of safe energy alternatives should 

 see unprecedented cooperation with State and local governments not a 

 battleground for a national takeover of community assets and not the 

 imposition of policy solutions preferred by just a few conservative men and 

 their business mates. 

 

 The vision of John Howard’s leadership is to impose nuclear energy on our  

 children with no guarantee of safe technology or waste storage with a half life 

 of hundreds of years. We know Australia will say yes to clean energy and no 

 to nuclear risk but this Government is not prepared to listen. 

 

 And then there is the Government’s IR laws but before we get to the 

 destruction of livelihoods that those laws have and continue to impose on 

 working Australians and their families consider the threat to our fundamental 

 freedoms, indeed the fabric of our democracy:  

 

 â¢ The constant attack on the independence of the ABC and now the 

 imposition of the “thought police”; 

 â¢ The continued participation in a war that Australians do not support; 

 â¢ The abandonment of the right to a fair trial with the denial of the 

 presumption of innocence; 

 â¢ The contempt for fundamental freedoms represented by the sedition laws 

 and the authoritarian power of the Attorney General;. 

 â¢ The acceptance of American interrogation procedures and the damage to 

 Australia’s long held opposition to all forms of torture; 

 â¢ The scaremongering on native title; 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  4 

 â¢ The encouragement of fear of difference in a multi-cultural society and the 

 constant attacks on Australian Muslims; 

 â¢ The determination to gag advocacy with the threat of de-funding civil 

 society organisations and/or the loss of charitable tax free status for those 

 that dare to speak out on behalf of the vulnerable.; 

 â¢ The abolition of funding of Commonwealth legal centres and the attempt to 

 gag the rest. 

 

 The Attorney General recently refused $25,000 in funding to a recent legal 

 centres conference. Why? Because I was on the program. Petty, arrogant, 

 authoritarian - all of the above. Nevertheless Julie Bishop and her community 

 legal services team would not be intimidated.  

 

 Likewise the churches, community groups and individuals who stood up for 

 the rights of asylum seekers and refugees, stood against imprisonment of 

 children and their parents, stood against the pacific solution and stood  

 against the insecurity of Temporary Protection Visas..  

 

 When Australians know something is wrong they will stand up and fight. 

 

 And fight we will; for freedom, for democracy, for humane public policy that 

 lives up to the test set by Sir William Dean of judging ourselves by the way we 

 treat the most vulnerable amongst us. That is why I support the campaign for 

 a “Human Rights Act” championed by New Matilda; an Act that will set the 

 foundations for a decent Australia. 

 

 We know, Australian workers and their families know, that a cornerstone of a 

 decent Australia is the fight to reinstate rights at work.  

 

 This morning we have been reminded by working Australians that, 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  5 

 even in the short time since March, John Howard’s laws have been found to 

 affect many in our communities; from some of the most vulnerable to active 

 union members. 

 

 Many union members are sheltered from the impact of these laws by the 

 thousands of collective agreements that you made sure were certified in the 6 

 months leading up to the passage of the legislation.   

 

 On the Government’s own estimates more than 1.6 million workers are 

 covered by union collective agreements made under the federal workplace 

 laws 1   

 

 Many others are protected under State awards and agreements, and State 

 Labor governments are using their powers to ameliorate the impact of the 

 laws on State public sector workers. 

 

 But despite this work, there are vulnerable workers with the least bargaining 

 power in the labour market who are most at risk: young workers; workers from 

 culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who are unfamiliar with their 

 rights; women (particularly those re-entering the labour market after a period 

 of caring responsibilities); and older workers who may have missed 

 opportunities to re-skill. 

 

 We are constantly being accused of running a scare campaign and I have 

 been personally accused by the Government of highlighting instances of 

 personal tragedy but at every community meeting I have attended there are 

 people with stories that break your heart, stories people come to tell about 

 themselves or a family member.

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  6 

 In Hobart last week we all shed a tear with the father and sister of Mick Webb. 

 Mick Webb was 45 years old. He had worked for the same employer for 

 nearly twenty years and, after the introduction of the Government laws, was 

 made redundant. He later committed suicide. The Coroner’s report confirms 

 the circumstances. A tragic waste of a life that might have been saved if the 

 unfair dismissal laws were still in place. In Mick’s case no redress meant no 

 hope. 

 

 For that community the determination to fight these laws is even stronger. 

 

 Then there are the stories of families struggling on minimum wages or 

 struggling without work. In many electorates up to a quarter (25%) of families 

 are living on less than $500 a week. And an unacceptable proportion of poor 

 families are those households where someone is in a low wage job. 

 

 Minimum wages 

 As a result of John Howard’s laws, the low paid in our country, workers who 

 rely upon the minimum wage, have experienced a 17 month wages freeze.  

 

 The government argues that there aren’t many people who rely on minimum 

 wages. They say that only one in five workers rely on minimum wages.   

 

 Well that means that about 1.2 million minimum wage workers who have 

 previously relied on federal awards are waiting for a wage increase.  These 

 workers matter to us. 

 

 Who are these low paid workers?.   

 

 â¢ Almost a third (31 percent) of women employed in the private sector rely 

 on minimum wages.   

 â¢ Almost half (48 per cent) of the casual workforce rely on minimum wages.   

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  7 

 â¢ One in four (39.9 per cent) elementary clerical, sales and service workers, 

 and over a third (37.0 per cent) of labourers and related workers) rely 

 upon minimum wages.  

 â¢ Six out of every ten workers in the hospitality industry; cleaners, room 

 attendants, waiters and others rely on minimum wages 

 â¢ Almost a third of retail employees are award dependent;  

 â¢ More than one in four workers in the health and community services 

 sector, who look after the moist vulnerable members of our community: 

 housing officers working with homeless people, welfare workers assisting 

 people with drug and alcohol dependencies, disability support workers 

 people with severe disabilities, personal care attendants in aged care 

 facilities, childcare workers, youth workers and others rely on minimum 

 wages. 

 These are our people. John Howard may not care but we do 

 Each pay period that goes by without an extra $30.00 or so a week in their 

 pay packet is tough on these workers.   

 

 They have to manage rising food, transport and housing costs.  The cost of 

 these items, which consume 52 cents in every dollar in low-income 

 households, has been rising faster than the CPI over the past 12 months. 

 

 And when the so called Fair pay Commission said they would listen to these 

 workers in Wollongong, to hear from low paid workers and minimum wage 

 dependent workers themselves, what happened? They didn’t even turn up. 

 They sent a PR firm! This was not even a one off - this appalling lack of 

 respect for working people, people already feeling anxious about the 

 exposure of the struggle of their private lives, occurred to four other 

 communities!   

 

 John Howard isn’t governing for these working people and their families.  

 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  8 

 His laws are not working for them even before we consider the impact of 

 individual contracts. 

 

 Individual contracts that cut pay and conditions 

 Many of these same workers face the prospect of working under an AWA, that 

 cuts their conditions and take home pay, and that puts at risk their ability to 

 meet their work and family commitments. 

 

 It is no coincidence that the industries with the highest take up rate of AWAs 

 are hospitality and retail industries, which also have a high a high proportion 

 of female and youth employment: In those industries AWAs are being used to 

 remove penalties and overtime rates.   

 

 Remember some of the landmark cases where the courage of these workers 

 has allowed us to tell Australia about the impact of these laws.  

 

 â¢ 16 year old juice bar worker Amber Oswald who was shifted onto an 

 individual contracts (AWAs) on the first day of the new laws, 27 March, 

 under which her hourly pay rate dropped and her penalty rates had been 

 abolished altogether. Under the new contract she would receive $40 less 

 for working a seven-hour shift on Sundays. 

 

 â¢ The image of Annette Harris with that Spotlight AWA that removed 

 penalty rates and overtime, and would cut her pay by up to $90 a week.   

 â¢ Or the eighty workers employed at Lufthansa’s GTS Melbourne call 

 centre who were given non-negotiable AWA individual contracts that cut 

 pay, reduced penalty rates and included a potentially discriminatory 

 bonus scheme. 

 These are not isolated examples.  Not even three months after the laws were 

 in place the Office of the Employment Advocate admitted that a representative 

 sample of AWAs showed: 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  9 

 â¢  Annual  leave  loading  had  been  removed  from  two  out  of  three  AWAs  

 (64%); 

 â¢ Penalty rates also gone from two out of three AWAs (63%); 

 â¢ Shift allowances axed in more than half of all new agreements (52%).  

 â¢ Overtime payments gone from more than half all new AWAs  (51%) 

 â¢ Public holiday payments gone from nearly half (46%) 

 â¢ Rest breaks axed in 40% of all new AWAs 

 â¢ One in six AWAs had abolished every protected award matter.   

 â¢  More  than  one  in  five  new  individual  contracts  (22%)  contained  no  pay  

 increases over the life of the agreement (AWA). 

 

 The total deregulation of working hours associated with these contracts has a 

 direct and detrimental impact on family life- on our ability to share a meal, to 

 assist with homework, spend time reading to or playing with our kids.   

 

 No guaranteed meal or rest breaks.  Little if any notice of change of shift.  

 Unpredictable hours.  These AWAs are the antithesis of family friendly.  They 

 are family hostile.   

 

 And they are discriminatory in their effects. There is no mechanism for 

 monitoring, effecting or maintaining equal pay. 

 

 And the PM and Kevin Andrews and Joe Hockey and Bronwyn Bishop and the 

 other advocates and apologists who brazenly assert otherwise should be 

 ashamed of themselves.  

 

 

 Unfair dismissal 

 Almost 4 million workers have lost the right to unfair dismissal protection.   

 

 We have never said that there would be 4 million unfair dismissals, but what 

 we have said if any of these 4 million are sacked without just cause, then they 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  10 

 will have no recourse to an impartial arbiter with power to restore then to their 

 job. 

 

 Within weeks of the laws taking effect we saw Emily O’ Connor , a single 

 mum, sacked from her childcare centre because the boss didn’t like her.  

 

 We saw 8 workers at Triangle cables, several of them, like Michael, injured at 

 work, seeking a collective agreement - sacked and unable to pursue their 

 case. 

 

 How do injured workers get another job before their injuries have healed? 

 Then there is the struggle of collective bargaining.  

 

 Collective Bargaining 

 For many of you in this room the impact of the new laws is felt most keenly in 

 the changes to workplace bargaining.   

 

 These have been designed to tie our hands in bargaining, to constrain the 

 ability of workers to protect and promote their interests through collective 

 bargaining, and to hand to the employer an unprecedented menu of scams 

 and schemes by which they can unilaterally determine the working 

 arrangements at their workplaces.  

 

 While the changes to bargaining have not been a feature of our public 

 campaign, those of you who are working closely with these laws know that in 

 fact it is in the area of bargaining that the extreme nature of the laws is plainly 

 and starkly exposed.  

 

 Each one of you probably has an example of how imbalanced the laws are.   

 

 How can it be right that workers face fines for simply asking for unfair 

 dismissal protection in their workplace agreement?   

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  11 

 

 How can it be fair that a union organiser can be denied access to a site to 

 inspect the workplace following a serious injury on site?  

 

 How can it be just that parties to an agreement can make a deal, and the very 

 next day the Minister can declare parts of the deal void. 

 

 How can it be right that the workers at Heinemann Electrics in Mulgrave work 

 their normal 38 hours a week but lose a full weeks pay because they refuse 

 overtime as part of a campaign of protected action?   

 

 How can it fair that they put in a full weeks’ work for no pay?   

 

 How can it be just that they face fines of up to $6,600 each if they simply ask 

 to be paid for work done?   

 

 It isn’t just. 

 It isn’t fair. 

 And it isn’t right! 

 

 Just how imbalanced these laws are was driven home to me when I was in 

 Tasmania recently and I met with some workers from United Petroleum. 

 

 These workers were employed under the State award.  Following a change of 

 ownership the employer restructured its business so that a different legal 

 entity became the employing entity.    

 

 Before doing so the new employing entity made a greenfields agreement with 

 itself - that is it unilaterally set the wages and conditions for the workforce 

 without regard to any existing agreement or award obligations.  It then offered 

 the workers, who for all purposes it already employed, a job with the new 

 employing entity.  The greenfields agreement pays a lower hourly rate, is 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  12 

 absolutely silent on hours of work and has no provision for breaks within or 

 between shifts.  Under the agreement a full time worker would be at least 

 $150 per week worse off.  

 

 And, as a bonus for engaging in this scam, the employer has effectively 

 removed the unions’ right of entry to organise at the workplace, and has 

 removed the workers right to strike.  

 

 On of the former United Petroleum workers has courageously spoken out 

 about the panic he felt when he realised he would lose $190 week or a 

 quarter of his take home pay. He knew he couldn’t pay the mortgage or the 

 loan on his new family car. But he was lucky and got another job. His 

 colleague John was not so lucky for when he went to Centrelink to get support 

 while he looked for another job he was told he that because he already had a 

 job with United Petroleum and, even if he couldn’t pay his bills thanks to the 

 cut in pay as a result of the new Greenfields contract, if he left he could not 

 get welfare payments for up to 13 weeks! 

 

 For me, this day in Hobart marked the stark difference between the Australia 

 John Howard wants and the one we are fighting for. As I stood with the 

 workers from United Petroleum losing up to a quarter of their week’ wage, 

 John Howard was celebrating his claim of a million AWA’s being signed.  

 

 We know which side we are on and we are building a movement for change 

 

 A Movement for Change 

 These are disgraceful laws. They have no place in a democratic society.  

 They are imbalanced and extreme.   

 

 But in this imbalance lies the seeds of their own destruction.   The extreme 

 nature of the laws will be their undoing.  

 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  13 

 Eminent law professor Ron Mc Callum has made this point too.   

 

 He points to the complexity of the laws.   

 

 He points to the overly prescriptive nature of the laws which force parties to 

 find a “work around” such as the common law arrangements that many unions 

 and employers are entering into.   

 

 And he points to the fact that most employers are disinterested in participating 

 in the ideological and unbalanced agenda that underpin the laws.2 

 

 

 Nor do the new laws meet the test of International law; fundamental workers 

 rights set by the ILO - the right to freedom of association, the right to organise 

 and bargain collectively and the right to be free from discrimination. 

 

 We are determined to see these laws off. 

 

 We will continue to use advertising to tell Australia the stories of workers who 

 suffer as a result of the laws.  

 

 We will continue to hold national community protests and November 30 2006 

 will be a magnificent day in our labour movement’s history.  

 

 But it is the effort in our own communities — the activities and the discussions 

 with our own members that will make the difference.  

 

 We know that Australians are turning away from the Coalition on industrial 

 relations. 

 

 

 2  Mc Callum, R Australian labour law after the WorkChoices Avalanche: Developing  an  employment law for our children, Delivered to Law Society of NSW 3 October 2006 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  14 

 Our research shows that 66% of workers who voted for the Liberal or National 

 Party at the last election are considering changing their vote.3 

 

 We need to shore up these promising trends and make sure they eventuate 

 into a vote for a change of government at the next federal election — to make 

 sure that every Australian votes to reinstate rights at work. 

 

 It is the conversation that our members, their families and community 

 supporters will drive deep into our communities; our homes, neighbourhoods, 

 workplaces, sporting clubs, social networks, anywhere working people and 

 their families meet - that is what will make the difference.   

 

 And we are not on our own. We have had broad support from the churches 

 and other community organisations.    

 

 Optimism 

 I firmly believe that we are witnessing the emergence of a positive movement 

 for change.   

 

 The movement for change involves a broad and diverse set of conversations.  

 Some are familiar: indigenous rights, alleviation of poverty, women’s rights, 

 and foreign policy. Some are overdue such as skills and industry policy.  

 Others are less familiar: climate change, terrorism, and genetic modification.   

 

 But in each I see an understanding that there is a call for a new social 

 settlement that will serve Australia in a modern global economy.   This 

 conversation is taking place amongst opinion leaders, but it is also taking 

 place in the community.  And unions are building strategic alliances and 

 developing reciprocal relationships with other civil society organisations. 

 

 

 3  These are the trend results from a pilot survey of 2000 union members (August - October  2006). The survey also confirmed previous findings that around 30-33% of union members  voted for the Coalition at the last election.  

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  15 

 This was obvious and optimistic as leaders from the National Council of  

 Churches, the ACF, ACOSS  and the ACTU with Indigenous and Ethnic 

 Community leaders at  an historic national civil society dialogue just two 

 weekends ago; a unique forum with Australia’s community leaders and yet the 

 Prime Minister could not find the time to attend!   

 

 Unions have an important and leadership role to play in this movement.  

 

 Our most direct contribution will be to advocate just and sustainable 

 workplace laws.   

 

 â¢ Laws that will facilitate working arrangements that meet the needs of 

 modern workplaces. 

 

 â¢ Laws that promote flexible participation in the workforce across through 

 the course of people’s lives, that support lifelong participation in education 

 and training, and that foster and reward the acquisition of skills.   

 

 â¢ Laws that allow workers to lead balanced lives, to meet their 

 responsibilities to their employers and to their families and their 

 communities.  

 

 Conclusion 

 The IR policy that we will debate over the coming two days, and that will 

 emerge from this Congress, will be the policy that we take into this social 

 dialogue.   

 

 The 2006 Congress thus heralds a new phase in our campaign for fair 

 workplace laws in Australia.   

 

 It is an historical opportunity for us to develop, in an open debate, a policy 

 framework to govern the design of new legislation that will ensure that jobs 

 

 

 

 ACTU Congress 2006 - President’s Address  16 

 are safe, secure and satisfying, and that working arrangements are fair and 

 facilitate workers meeting their family and community obligations as well as 

 the needs of productive and efficient enterprises.  

 

 And it will provide the script for us to continue the conversation that we have 

 been having with the Australian community, to champion not only the values 

 that we hold, but the means by which we can deliver fairness at work.   

 

 I encourage you to participate and contribute to the debate and listen carefully 

 to the contributions of others, so that when we leave here tomorrow afternoon 

 we are confident that we have a robust and sustainable policy. 

 

 And then it will be up to all of us to promote it: 

 With purpose, with discipline and with unity.   

 

 And if we do that, we will win. 

 

 On Nov 15th 2005 we made a promise that we would not be the first 

 generation to hand on a lesser set of rights to our children than those fought 

 for by our parents and grandparents. We meant it. 

 Losing is not an option. 

 

 Your Rights at Work are worth fighting for and we will do just that.
