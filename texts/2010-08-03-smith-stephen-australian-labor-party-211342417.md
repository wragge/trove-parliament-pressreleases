 Doorstop at Pacific Islands Forum 

 Transcript 

 Main topic: Pacific Islands Forum, Fiji, Nauru, Uighurs 

 3 August 2010 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I’m very pleased to be in Vanuatu representing the Prime Minister and representing 

 Australia at the Pacific Island Leaders’ Forum. 

 Of course it’s during an election campaign and we’re here in caretaker period so I won’t propose to be 

 drawn too extensively on matters occurring back at home. I’ll leave my colleagues to do that. But I’m very 

 happy to speak about matters here. 

 Firstly, we have been very pleased with the successful year that Australia has had as Chair of the Pacific 

 Islands Forum. Particularly with the Cairns Compact on development assistance, better coordination, better 

 effectiveness. We’re very pleased with the work the Pacific Islands Forum has done together on climate 

 change, and very pleased to hand over the Chair to Vanuatu. 

 In the course of today and tomorrow, I will have a number of formal bilateral meetings. I’ve already had a 

 bilateral meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key and Murray McCully, who is the New 

 Zealand Foreign Minister. Firstly indicate publicly what I said to him in private which is that we of course 

 extend our commiserations and our condolences on the loss of a New Zealand serviceman overnight in 

 Afghanistan. 

 In addition to speaking formally with Prime Minister Key, I’ve also spoken with Prime Minister Natapei, the 

 Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Secretary General Slade, and my Nauruan counterpart, 

 Kieren Keke, and I’ll obviously see other leaders and Ministers in the course of the day and tomorrow. 

 I’ve just come from a signing ceremony where we have signed up Pacific Partnerships for Development 

 with the Federated States of Micronesia, with the Marshall Islands and with Palau. Later today will sign the 

 first of our Pacific Security Partnerships with Kiribati and Samoa. All of these, of course, flow from our 

 enhanced engagement with the Pacific, starting with our Port Moresby Declaration. 

 We now have some eleven Pacific Partnerships for Development signed up which formalise our 

 development assistance partnership with the countries and the islands of the Pacific Island Forum. 

 Can I just, in conclusion, note that today we have seen a record monthly trade surplus for Australia. A 3.5 

 billion dollar trade surplus, a very encouraging monthly figure, both increases in volumes and increases in 

 prices. So that’s a significant economic indicator and we welcome that very much. I’m happy to respond to 

 any questions. 

 STEPHEN SMITH:  

 QUESTION: Minister, what message does it send to Pacific Islanders here, Pacific leaders here, that Julia 

 Gillard could not spare one day of her election campaign to come to speak to them? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, other than Fiji, of course, Pacific Island leaders are all democratic and they 

 understand the nature of elections. There’s no surprise, and they perfectly understand it. This of course has 

 occurred in the past. On the last occasion, Foreign Minister Downer represented the Prime Minister 

 Howard, so it’s neither a surprise nor a difficulty for the Leaders. They welcomed me very warmly. I was 

 very pleased to be able to formally hand over to Prime Minister Natapei and it’s a very good participation in 

 the Forum, so far as Australia is concerned. 

 QUESTION: On the issue of Fiji, do you have any comments to make on what Commodore Bainimarama 

 said to the ABC along the lines of Australia and New Zealand wield too much influence in the Forum? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I have to confess that I haven’t seen his remarks on the ABC. But in the past, of course, 

 he has been critical of Australia, he’s been critical of New Zealand, and he’s been critical of Australia and 

 New Zealand because Australia and New Zealand, together with the other countries of the Pacific Islands 

 Forum, have been at the forefront of seeking to persuade Fiji to return to democracy. 

 The Pacific Islands Forum unanimously suspended Fiji from the Councils of the Forum. The 

 Commonwealth has also suspended Fiji from the Councils of the Commonwealth. So it’s no surprise that 

 Commodore Bainimarama is critical of Australia. It’s no surprise that he’s critical of New Zealand. It’s no 

 surprise he’s critical of the Pacific Islands Forum because until Fiji returns to democracy, there is unanimity 

 of view that Fiji cannot sit at Ministerial level around the Forum Councils. 

 QUESTION: How do respond, then, to the communiquÃ© that they issued with Commodore Bainimarama 

 about four of the leaders who seemed to show Fiji quite a bit of support and said Fiji should be fully 

 engaged in the region? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Australia has made the point consistently that we want to have a dialogue with Fiji. 

 Indeed, as a member of the Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Contact Group, a few weeks ago, I was in 

 Auckland. We met with the Fijian Foreign Minister. We were invited as a Ministerial Contact Group to go to 

 Fiji to have discussions, and within 24 hours that was withdrawn by Commodore Bainimarama. 

 So, we’d like very much to have a dialogue with Commodore Bainimarama, but it’s very hard to have a 

 one-way dialogue. That’s the first point. Secondly, we’ve always made it clear that Australia has no 

 difficulty with Fiji meeting with other countries. Indeed, that dialogue is a good thing. For example, we had 

 no difficulty with Fiji, as a member of the Melanesian Spearhead Group, meeting as a Melanesian 

 Spearhead Group. We did have concerns, and expressed those concerns, when Commodore Bainimarama 

 sought to go further and try and use the so-called Melanesian Spearhead Group Plus to propose meetings 

 to seek to undermine the Pacific Forum itself. 

 QUESTION: Do you think Prime Minister Somare’s no-show is related somehow to Fiji? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: You have to ask Prime Minister Somare. There are a number of absences and none of 

 them cause me any concern. As I say, you will have to ask Papua New Guinea, but we know that there has 

 been an uncertain political time in Papua New Guinea recently. 

 Secondly, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Derek Sikua is not here because the Solomons are 

 actually having an election today. As I said in my handover remarks, citizens of the Pacific value that very 

 much and we want to see it exercised in a full and free and timely way for all citizens of the Pacific, 

 including Fijians. So, there are a number of absences at leadership level. They are all understandable, but 

 you’d need to ask Prime Minister Somare the reasons for his absence. But he’s well represented. 

 QUESTION: Are you worried by the Engaging Fiji summit’s communiquÃ© which found that Fiji’s path to 

 democracy as they call it is credible? Are you worried that there might be some leaders here who might be 

 pushing for Fiji…? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well in the discussion that I have had, both with officials and with leaders and Ministers, 

 I detect no inkling, no support, no suggestion that the Pacific Island Forum would do anything other than 

 that which it has been done in the past, which is to unanimously adopt the position that Fiji is suspended 

 from the Forum, pending a return to democracy. 

 Of course there are discussions about how we can encourage Fiji to have a dialogue, whether it’s through 

 the Ministerial Contact Group or through other mechanisms. So I think there are two shared sentiments, 

 and I think Australia shares both sentiments strongly; that it is not appropriate for Fiji to take part in the 

 Pacific Islands Forum whilst it is under military rule, but it is appropriate for all of us to make our ongoing 

 efforts to seek to engage the Commodore, and the interim government in Fiji in a dialogue, to get it back on 

 a path to democracy. 

 QUESTION: Do you there is an opportunity for Australia and New Zealand then to engage with Fiji when 

 they were invited to the Engaging Fiji meeting last month, but didn’t we decline that invitation? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: We were invited at officials’ level and we declined the invitation. We believe that the 

 most important mechanism, for Australian efforts, to engage Fiji, is through the Pacific Islands Forum and 

 through the Ministerial Contact Group. But we will also pursue what we regard as other appropriate 

 advances, other appropriate efforts, at dialogue. But for the present, we’d like to pursue those efforts 

 through the Forum itself and through the Ministerial Contact Group, of which, of course, I’ve been a 

 member of for some time. 

 QUESTION: But if they’re suspended from the Forum, how are they meant to engage in that dialogue? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Through the Ministerial Contact Group which is what I say, having gone to Auckland, 

 having invited interim Foreign Minister Ratu Kubuobola to meet with us; that having occurred, the Foreign 

 Minister having invited the Ministerial Contact Group to go again to Fiji for the third occasion, we were 

 disappointed that within 12 to 24 hours, Commodore Bainimarama had withdrawn that invitation. 

 QUESTION: Prime Minister Gillard had phoned quite a number of foreign leaders, but it seems that she 

 ignores the most important trading partner, China, so what do you think of that? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, that analysis is wrong. When she came to office, she made a number of calls and 

 received a number of calls. Very quickly, as you’d appreciate, the election intervened, and it’s not 

 appropriate for her to make calls during that period. When the election is concluded, on the basis of a 

 successful outcome for the Government, if the Government is re-elected, then of course the usual 

 congratulatory calls, the usual courtesy calls and the full exchanges will occur with all of our key trading 

 partners, with all of our key bilateral partners, including China. 

 QUESTION: The detention centre issue, have there been any discussions about that here today? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I will be a bit careful in what I say, because I know that it is a controversial issue in the 

 context of the campaign. But I’m very happy to indicate part of that conversation I had with Foreign Minister 

 Keke from Nauru because I’ve said it publicly in Australia. I indicated to him that if Nauru wanted to sign up 

 for the Refugee Convention, that if they came to that conclusion or decision, then Australia would be very 

 happy to offer it whatever technical assistance it could to facilitate the technical detail of signing up for the 

 Convention. 

 We have a significant development assistance partnership with Nauru, we work very closely with them, so 

 in my discussions with Foreign Minister Keke, we of course spoke about our general bilateral relationship, 

 our development assistance partnership, the things that Australia is doing and can do to assist Nauru. We 

 touched upon that issue. I indicated as is on public record that we are in discussions with East Timor about 

 a regional processing centre in East Timor, and those discussions are effectively underway. But will of 

 course take up again, in earnest, at the conclusion of the election campaign. 

 I expect to see East Timorese Foreign Minister Zacharias De Costa later tonight. He of course is here as 

 part of the Pacific Island Forum Post-Forum Dialogue, so I’ll no doubt have a conversation with him as well. 

 QUESTION: Minister, can I just return to my earlier question. There are no undercurrents of support for Fiji 

 that you are detecting on this visit? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, as I say, there are two sentiments. Firstly there is the very strong sentiment that it 

 is not appropriate for Fiji to return to the Forum until it returns to democracy. 

 Secondly, there is also a very strong sentiment that somehow we have to get Fiji back into a dialogue. And 

 that is not just a sentiment that I have detected in the course of my conversations today, it’s the very strong 

 view that Australia takes and a very strong view that I have put on the record on any number of occasions. 

 QUESTION: One more question about Nauru. Why did you feel that it was necessary to warn Nauru or 

 counsel Nauru about their dealings with the Russians? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Firstly, I don’t warn other countries. That’s the first point. Secondly, I was happy to put 

 on the record part of my conversation with Kieran Keke because I relayed to him privately and person-to-person that which I’d said publicly and I wanted to do it face-to-face because I’d done it courtesy of one of 

 your television cameras. But I’m not proposing to go uphill and down dale on all of the aspects of our 

 conversation. That would not be appropriate. 

 QUESTION: Minister, on Palau, have you been approached by the Palau government to take Uighurs who 

 were recently in Guantanamo and have now...  

 STEPHEN SMITH:It hasn’t been raised with me. My contact with Palau to date has been to sign with Palau 

 a Pacific Partnership for Development which I just did with the President. 

 That matter has not been raised with me. I would need to check to indicate to you whether it’s been raised 

 as officials’ level but it hasn’t been raised with me. 

 QUESTION: And would Australia take them? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well any applicant for migration status to Australia is of course always subject to our 

 exhaustive migrant and security assessments. We’ve made that clear in respect of anyone who comes to 

 my country, including suggestions of Uighurs from Palau or from other countries. 

 Thanks very much
