 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H98/2003 - 30 July 2003

 

 New Contracts for Migrant English Language Tuition in South Australia

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced the  awarding of contracts worth $23 million that will result in English language tuition for over  6,000 migrants and refugees in South Australia over the next five years. 

 The contracts will provide English language tuition to migrants and refugees from more than  88 countries and 67 language backgrounds.

 The contracts are between the Commonwealth and AIT English Language Services (AIT)  and LM Training Specialists Pty Ltd (LMT), respectively. This is the second contract for the  delivery of Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) that each tuition provider has won. 

 The Minister said that as the current providers of AMEP in South Australia, both AIT and  LMT have managed to achieve and maintain high levels of reach and student satisfaction. 

 'These excellent results can be attributed to their commitment to providing high quality,  accessible, educational, and settlement focused support services to their AMEP clients,' Mr  Hardgrave said.

 Mr Hardgrave said he was looking forward to continuing a successful partnership that will  facilitate AMEP's reach to its very diverse client base, and serve the needs of AMEP clients,  the community and Australia as a whole.

 Nationally, the Federal Government has allocated more than $500 million over the next five  years to the AMEP, including $114 million this financial year.

 Mr Hardgrave said that the new contracts with AMEP service providers in each state and  territory would help more than 100,000 new arrivals on their journey to successful settlement  in Australia.

 'The Adult Migrant English Program is a vital component of the Government's commitment to  'nation building', community harmony and cohesion,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'It represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth in ensuring that new arrivals  have every opportunity to learn our national language, and so take the first and most  important step towards full participation in Australian society.'

 While in Adelaide, the Minister will also conduct settlement consultations on the  implementation of the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian  Entrants.

 'This review has been invaluable in providing a clearer picture of what needs to be done to  better meet the needs of newly arrived migrants and refugees,' Mr Hardgrave said.
