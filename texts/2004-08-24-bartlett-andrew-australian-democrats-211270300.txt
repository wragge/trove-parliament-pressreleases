 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/794 TUESDAY 24 AUGUST 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION NEW REFUGEE VISA MEASURES - THE LIES CONTINUE One Step Forward Follows Ten Steps Backwards The Australian Democrats today criticised the latest Temporary Protection Visa regulations that have been introduced by Immigration Minister Vanstone as adding to the uncertainty facing refugees on temporary visas. Leader of the Australian Democrats and Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, "This is yet another example of the Government trying to deceive the Australian public by pretending this is a rather than a genuine attempt to assist suffering refugees, rather than a half-smart attempt to get the Government out of political problem of its own making. "The Government's temporary visa policy has deliberately torn families apart and left thousands of refugees in a state of uncertainty and insecurity.  The Government is putting a band aid on a gaping wound and then trying to con Australians into thinking they are being humane. "While this move will eventually provide some people with security and safety, it continues the Governmentâ€™s practice of fixing up problems caused by bad policy by adding another one, rather than admitting the original mistake and fixing it.  It is more bad policy that will lead to more unnecessary suffering.  Refugees deserve certainty and protection because they are fleeing persecution, not because the Minister thinks they might be able to fill employment needs. "The Democrats believe that every extra chance for refugees to stay should be pursued, but no one should be fooled into thinking this move will fix the problem of uncertainty. Refugees should be able to stay, rather than have to go through more uncertainty and more hurdles." The Australian Democrats repeat our calls for the Government to scrap its policy of only giving refugees' temporary protection. Temporary visas keeps families separated, deny refugees access to services, and prevents them rebuilding their shattered lives. "This is another example of dishonest from the Government.  They take away certainty and freedom from refugees, separate them from their families, then give back a few options to some and try to say they are giving 'more choice'. "The Minister also is continuing to spout the lie that Australia has a generous refugee program, when we host far fewer refugees then many other far poorer countries do, and we are deliberately shattering the families of thousands of those that we do host.  There is nothing 'generous' about prolonging and adding to suffering and destroying their families. "The 'Return Pending Visa' is just a transparent attempt to put off any need to deport refugees until after the election.  It would be more appropriate to call it an 'Election Pending Visa'," he concluded. Media Contact - Rowena Bew - 0400 729 555
