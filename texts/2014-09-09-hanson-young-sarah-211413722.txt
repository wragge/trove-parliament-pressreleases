 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday, 9 September 2014    

 Immigration Minister not fit to be children’s  guardian    

 Following evidence given to the Human Rights Commission inquiry into children in detention  today, the Australian Greens have called on all parties to support a bill that would see the  Immigration Minister stripped of the guardianship of unaccompanied refugee children.    

 “The Minister is clearly incapable of acting in these children’s best interests,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The Greens’ bill, which has been introduced into the Senate, would see the guardianship of  unaccompanied children taken from the Minister and given to an independent office.    

 “Minister Morrison and Minister Bowen have both failed to act in the best interest of children  that they have been guardian to.    

 “It’s hard to imagine anything more terrifying for a young, unaccompanied girl than being sent  to the hellhole on Nauru.    

 “Scott Morrison is these children’s jailer, not their guardian, and I call on all of my colleagues in  the Parliament to support this bill.”
