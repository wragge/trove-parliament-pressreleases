 Commonwealth Games divides Victorian youth: Poll

 Almost half of young Victorians plan to attend or be involved in the 2006  Commonwealth Games, Senator Natasha Stott Despojas annual Youth Poll survey  has revealed. "The survey results show that participating in and watching sport remains a popular  activity for many young people," Senator Stott Despoja said.  Youth Poll 2005 also revealed many young peoples lives are touched by suicide, with  more than half of respondents knowing someone who had attempted or committed  suicide. Other major issues for young people this year include: increased university fees  (65% say increased HECS fees will discourage them from attending university);  reconciliation (71% believe the Government should enter into a treaty with  Indigenous Australians); and, access to contraception (80% want young people to  have access to free birth control).  "A significantly higher percentage of respondents than last year (60% compared to  42%) do not support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  "For more than a decade, Youth Poll has provided young people with a forum to  express their views on a range of topics.  "Through Youth Poll, young peoples views are publicised in the media and reported  to Parliament," Senator Stott Despoja said. Other State specific findings include: an overwhelming 85% of respondents from  New South Wales do not support a night curfew for young P-plated drivers; 74% of  South Australian respondents do not support the impounding of cars playing loud  music or doing burnouts; and, 71% of ACT respondents believe there are not enough  services for young people in their Territory.
