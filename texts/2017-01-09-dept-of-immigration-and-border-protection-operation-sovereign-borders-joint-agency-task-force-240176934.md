 09-01-2017 -



 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the on-water



 reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



 The reporting period is from 1 December 2016 to 31 December 2016.



 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration authorities.



 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres.



 Fourteen illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. There were no illegal maritime



 arrival detainees involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin.



 Three illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



 country.



 As at 31 December 2016, there was a total of 866 people in Manus Island RPC and 380 people in Nauru RPC. With



 the opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on



 those still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



 Of the 1015 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 510 were positive and 505 were



 negative as at 31 December 2016. There were 669 refugees who have been given a positive final determination.



 There were 190 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



 Of the 1200 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 983 were positive and 217 were negative



 as at 31 December 2016.
