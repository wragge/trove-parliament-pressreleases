 LABOR PUTS OUT WELCOME MAT FOR 40TH BOAT ARRIVAL 

 The Hon Sussan Ley MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 “With 40th boat arrival since Labor weakening our border protection system in August 2008, all Home Affairs 

 Minister Brendan O’Connor can do is congratulate Border Protection Command’s (BPC) costly interception of 

 these unauthorised vessels,” Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Sussan Ley said today.  

 “However another interception is simply not a successful border protection policy,” Ms Ley said.  

 The boat was intercepted today at 9.20am (AEST) by HMAS Bathurst, operating under the control of BPC, 

 approximately 18 nautical miles north Ashmore Island.  

 This latest arrival carrying 52 passengers and 3 crew members brings the number of unauthorised arrivals to 

 1928.  

 “This huge surge in people smuggling activity proves that the Rudd Government’s policy is encouraging people to 

 make the dangerous voyage to Australia,” Ms Ley said.  

 “Border Protection Command is already stretched beyond capacity and the Christmas Island detention centre is 

 almost full to the brim.  

 “Mr Kevin Rudd must immediately launch an independent inquiry into the relationship between his changes in 

 policy and the huge surge in people smuggling activity.  

 “The bottom line is that this Labor Government is not committed to protecting Australia’s borders,” Ms Ley said.
