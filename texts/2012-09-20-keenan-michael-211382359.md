 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling COST OF LABOR’S DENIAL GROWS DAILY September 20, 2012

 The arrival of another illegal boat, with 67 people on board, comes as the cost of Labor’s denial over restoring temporary  protection visas and turning boats back where safe to do so, rises every day, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "The denial that Labor trotted out for years over their refusal to restore offshore processing on Nauru as the illegal boats  and cost, chaos and tragedy mounted, is the same denial now over their ongoing refusal to restore the full suite of Howard  Government border protection measures to stop the boats," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Labor’s on-going denial has seen 5,216 people now arrive on illegal boats less than a quarter of the way through this  financial year. Wayne Swan’s budget was based on 5,400 people arriving during the entire financial year, guaranteeing  more budget blow outs which have already cost Australian taxpayers over $5 billion and counting. 

 "This week Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan refused to come clean with the Australian people on just how big this latest  blow out would be and the impact on the budget. Labor won’t say where the money is coming from. 

 "This is a bad omen for ordinary Australians. They know that Labor will yet again turn to that which they do best - tax," Mr  Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "We are only just over half way through September and already 22 illegal boats carrying well over 1,400  people have arrived in Australian waters illegally - once again Labor is on track to break their own shameful record for the  most boat arrivals in a month. 

 "Border Protection Command (BPC) continues to operate in an environment where Labor has subjected Customs to  savage funding and staff cuts - totalling $64 million and 750 staff. 

 "The Coalition is committed to stopping the boats and in turn putting an end to our patrol vessels being used as water  taxis for people smugglers," Mr Keenan said.
