 TRANSCRIPT   

    TONY BURKE MP   

 Member for Watson     Shadow Minister for Immigration   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP  INTERVIEW, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,  CANBERRA -   TUESDAY 20 JUNE 2006  E&OE-PROOF ONLY   

 

 Subject:  World Refugee Day, Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised  Arrivals) Bill 2006.  ________________________________________________________________________ 

 

 Tony Burke:  Today is World Refugee Day.  The theme for World Refugee Day this  year is hope.  It’s an appropriate day in Australian politics as well.  Today is the day for  John Howard to acknowledge that this Bill should not go forward.     

 He’s received a unanimous report from the Senate Committee.  He’s received continued  representations from his own backbench.  His own backbench have made it clear that to  go ahead with the Bill that’s currently before the Parliament completely betrays every  guarantee that was given 12 months ago.     

 Today’s the day John Howard has to acknowledge that even if he wanted to put the Bill  through there would be the sort of gagging of debate that we have not seen before.   Because if he is going to change the Bill, it means there is no Senate inquiry into the  changes, there’s no scrutiny of any amendments, there’s no opportunity for any  reasonable debate from any Member of Parliament.     

 Today is the day for John Howard to acknowledge that it is time to end what was always  a bad idea.     

 We have seen an article in The Age today that just confirms what a bad idea it was when  the mental health teams haven’t even been able to easily gain access to Nauru even when  they are sent at the direction of the Australian Government.  If that’s  what is happening  for mental health teams the same would happen with the Commonwealth Ombudsman if  they amended the Bill to allow the Commonwealth Ombudsman to reach Nauru.  There’s  no way of amending this Bill to make it anything other than a betrayal of what happened 

 12 months ago.  The Liberal Party backbench recognise that, Labor knows it; it’s time for  John Howard to catch up and make the same decision.   

 Journalist:  Will it be embarrassing for John Howard if he doesn’t have it through  Parliament by the time he meets Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono next week?   

 Tony Burke:  It’s an embarrassment of his own making.  The most embarrassing thing at  the moment is that we are sending a message to the region that we are willing to change  our domestic law to try to improve a relationship with another country.  That’s  embarrassing.  The embarrassment of a backdown is nothing compared to what’s about to  happen on the international stage if John Howard goes ahead and makes us the only  country that will change our law because one of our friends gets cranky.     

 

 

 

 END.
