 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 ONE YEAR LATER AND SYRIAN REFUGEES STILL WAITING    

 Today marks one year since the former Prime Minister confirmed that Australia would  welcome 12,000 Syrian refugees, but one year later there are still thousands of people  waiting to call Australia home.    

 A lot of promises were made to the Australian public and refugee families, but itâ€™s still  not clear when the majority of refugees will resettle in Australia.    

 For the last 12 months, the Turnbull Government has been tight lipped about how many  Syrian refugees are still living in limbo while they wait to come to Australia, how many  people are already here and where families are living.    

 By contrast, counties like Canada have an ongoing commitment to transparency and  regularly release the actual numbers of Syrian refugees who have been resettled, the  category of resettlement including government or private assisted and where in the  country these families are living.    

 To be clear, the need to conduct the appropriate background, health and security  checks is not in question. This is a matter of transparency in an important, publicly  funded government program. The Government needs to explain why it appears they  have grossly underestimated the resources required to deliver against its commitments.    

 Refugees fleeing Syria are incredibly vulnerable and the Turnbull Government needs to  commit to transparency and an open discussion about how many people have been  resettled and when the others will arrive.    

 On the one year anniversary, Minister Dutton should immediately commit to ongoing  transparency about the resettlement of these vulnerable people.
