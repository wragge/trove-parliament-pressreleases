 Demand for qualified 
personnel could provide more opportunities for skilled migration to 
the ACT, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, said today. 

 In Canberra as part 
national consultations on Australia's 1999-2000 migration program, Mr 
Ruddock said there are a range of migration mechanisms enabling State 
and Territory Governments to have a greater influence over the volume 
and profile of skilled migrants coming into their region. 

 "By taking advantage 
of programs such as the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) the 
ACT will be able to help meet the demand for qualified professionals. 

 "The RSMS enables 
Australian employers in certain areas to fill skilled permanent vacancies 
with overseas personnel if they cannot find suitably qualified workers 
in Australia." 

 Mr Ruddock quoted   Settler Arrivals  
data which showed that skilled migrants represented 35 per cent of the 
total settler arrivals to the ACT for the 1997-1998 period compared 
with 27.3 per cent for the previous year. 

 "These figures 
reflect the emphasis that the Government has placed on attracting skilled 
migrants, and our determination to deliver a balanced program - the 
Government is committed to ensuring that Australia is getting the expertise 
it needs." 

 Mr Ruddock said the   Settler Arrivals  
report also showed that: 

  During this year's consultations Mr Ruddock is meeting a wide cross-section 
of individuals and organisations including representatives of business, 
industry, union, environment, welfare , refugee, humanitarian 
and ethnic community groups. 

 "I am also, for 
the first time, conducting a nation-wide round of public meetings on 
the migration program," Mr Ruddock added. 

 "I trust this will 
provide a unique opportunity for many Australians to contribute their 
ideas and comments on the size and composition of Australia's immigration 
program." 

 A public meeting is 
being held in Canberra tonight at the Rydges Lakeside. 

 Consultations and public 
meetings are also being held in Melbourne, Griffith, Sydney, Albury-Wodonga, 
Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns and Darwin Launceston and Hobart.
