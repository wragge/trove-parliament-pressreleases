 The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Customs and Justice 

 17 December 2008   

 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release   

 Border security disaster looms 

 

 

 Yesterday’s illegal boatload of 37 asylum seekers is further proof that the Rudd Labor  Government’s change of policy and lack of adequate resources, is been clearly noted by  people smugglers.   

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs, Sussan Ley, said this latest arrival bringing this  year’s total to 164, which exceeds 2007 arrivals and shows there is a real problem with  border security.   

 “The Rudd Labor Government’s $51.5 million in budget cuts to the Australian Customs  Service in real terms, has significantly hampered Customs ability to respond to the multitude  of security threats that land on Australia’s borders,” she said.   

 Ms Ley said Customs not only protects Australian borders from illegal boat arrivals.   

 “In conjunction with several other tasks, Customs are responsible for overseeing mass  volumes of imports and exports, along with detecting illicit drugs and prohibited imports to  ensure they do not get through the gate.   

  “Customs are the front line in protecting our borders from these threats and the Rudd Labor  Government has taken this for granted when they recklessly slashed funds to our border  protection and law enforcement agencies,” Ms Ley said.   

 “Due to this irresponsible fiscal management by the Rudd Labor Government, Customs is  under immense pressure to detect the flood of illegal boats in Australian waters ever since  Labor softened asylum laws.   

 “Our border protection arrangements have deteriorated significantly since the election of the  Rudd Labor Government, Mr Rudd is setting Australia up for a border security disaster,” Ms  Ley said.
