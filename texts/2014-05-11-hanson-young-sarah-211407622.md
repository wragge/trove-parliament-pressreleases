 Manus report is a secretive whitewash: Greens   

 The Australian Government must release, in full, it's report into the violence on Manus Island and  the killing of Reza Barati, the Australian Greens have said.   

 "A young man was brutally killed while in our care and, instead of rigorously pursuing the truth, the  Abbott Government is doing everything it can to cover it up," the Greens' immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 "The Abbott Government has shown scant regard for the safety and welfare of the people that it  failed to keep safe on that brutal night in February.   

 "Reports that the PNG police inquiry has been delayed, so that it can be massaged into repeating the  findings of the Australian Government's review, are very concerning.   

 "It has been months since Reza Barati was killed but the Government is continuing to hide behind its  coordinated whitewash of an investigation while hundreds of refugees are forced to live in fear.   

 "The cruel and dangerous Manus Island camp is untenable and must be closed now, before more  lives are lost."
