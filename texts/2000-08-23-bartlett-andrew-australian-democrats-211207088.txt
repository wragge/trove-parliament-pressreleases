 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 23 Aug 2000 Press Release Number: 00/517 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Ruddock goes overboard on deportations The Australian Democrats today accused the Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, of going overboard on the deportation of refugees.

 The last of the Kosovo refugees were yesterday deported at night from the Port Hedland detention centre, and today three Somalian men face deportation and possible death at a Somalian airport.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats’ spokesperson on immigration, said “I feel great regret at the way the Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, is treating these refugees who are in dire need.

 "Last night’s deportation of some of the last Kosovo refugees is another sad event in the litany of Australia's poor treatment of refugees.

 "For Mr Ruddock to say that Kosovo refugees don't qualify as refugees is a disgrace. The Kosovars were deported at night when no one was expecting it, a sign that Minister Ruddock is once again trying to hide what is happening.

 "Australia initially acted with great compassion towards the Kosovo refugees so it is a great shame it has ended up like this".

 Compounding this action is the situation currently with three Somalian men who face deportation. The Uniting Church of Australia and Amnesty International both say this would put the men in great danger and call for them to be given asylum. The men have sought asylum before the Refugee Review Tribunal twice and the Federal Court once without being granted the right to stay.

 "Australia has an obligation as a signatory to the Convention Against Torture not to return people to a place where they face a real risk of being tortured or killed.

 "Amnesty and the Uniting Church both believe the men are in great danger if deported and that they could be killed on arrival at the Somalian airport. So how can the Immigration Department conceive of, let alone go ahead with this planned deportation?" concluded Senator Bartlett.
