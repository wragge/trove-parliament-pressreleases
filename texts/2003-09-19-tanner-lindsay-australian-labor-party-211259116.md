 Tonight we honour the memory of a man of courage and compassion, a great Labor  leader,  Arthur Calwell.  Few Australian political leaders have influenced the shape of  our modern society more.  Few have received less credit from history for such a major  contribution.   

 The Australia that Arthur Calwell knew when he entered Parliament was a profoundly  different place from the one we know now.  In those days being anything but Anglo-Irish was a matter for curiosity and suspicion.   Arthur Calwell had the heart and  imagination to see the part Australia could play in relieving the suffering of millions  of European refugees.  He had a vision for a stronger and more vibrant nation. He  imagined a bigger and better country, and played a vital role in bringing it into being.   

 Arthur Calwell's immigration program truly shaped modern Australia.   History has  unfairly portrayed him as a symbol of the White Australia Policy.   He should be  remembered as the very person who made the end of White Australia possible.

 Calwell pushed the boundaries of racial inclusion at a time when it was extremely  politically risky to do so.  He facilitated Lebanese immigration.  He promoted  citizenship rights for Chinese - Australians.  He even spoke some Mandarin, and was  revered by the Chinese community in Melbourne.  In 1944 Calwell  wrote to Ben  Chifley about his dream 'to develop a heterogeneous society: a society where  Irishness and Roman Catholicism would be as acceptable as Englishness and  Protestantism, where an Italian background would be as acceptable as a Greek, a  Dutch or any other'.  Calwell’s outstanding achievement is that he largely fulfilled this  aim.   

 

 

 Immediately after the war the appalling magnitude of Hitler's attempt to exterminate  the Jewish people was not widely understood, and anti-semitism was widespread in  Australia.  Calwell had the moral courage to  defy these attitudes and accelerate the  immigration of thousands of Holocaust survivors.  The Arthur Calwell Memorial  Forest planted in Israel in 1996 reflects the depth of gratitude felt by the Jewish  community.  His courage and compassion gave hope to people who had endured  appalling suffering.   

 Through passionate advocacy and dogged determination, Arthur Calwell won  community acceptance for an enormous influx of people he dubbed “New  Australians”.  He was so successful that the term itself later came to be seen as  condescending.  The substance of his achievement overtook the label designed to  drive it.   

  Our generation of political leaders now faces the challenge of achieving community  acceptance of Asian, African and Middle Eastern immigration.  As we continue the   struggle for racial tolerance and understanding, we should never forget Arthur  Calwell’s contribution.   

 The agonizing process of changing Australia into a truly multicultural society began  with Calwell.  His vision expanded Australian horizons.  Subsequent leaders from  both sides of politics made important contributions to this process of transforming  Australian society.  Menzies, Holt, Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke and Keating all advanced  the cause, building on foundations laid by Arthur Calwell.   

 All that progress came to a shuddering halt under John Howard in 2001.   

 For over thirty years Australian leaders from both sides of politics have chosen not to  exploit latent racism in the Australian community for political gain, conscious of the  longer term damage it could do to our country.   John Howard had no such scruples.  Under serious political pressure he responded with the cunning and morality of a  cornered rat.   

 Labor’s support for the Howard Government’s brutal approach to asylum seekers in  the 2001 election was the most traumatic experience of my political career.  Labor’s  capitulation to the tactics of group vilification and racial discrimination in 2001 may  be forgiven, but  should not be forgotten.  We can't fight that battle again, but we can

 learn from this terrible episode.  We must never again allow ourselves to be forced to  jettison our fundamental values in pursuit of political survival.   

 It's beyond me how any civilised society can imprison little children for something  their parents  have done.  As the father of children aged nine and six the very idea that  they could be punished in this way for something I have done horrifies me.  Right  now helpless children are incarcerated in Australia because their parents sought a  better life by trying to come to our country.  Some are even born into imprisonment.  How can our nation do this?   

 Values are not a dispensable item for a political party.  They are not optional extras to  be deployed only when circumstances are appropriate. Without coherent values a  party has no identity, no recognizable brand.  In the wake of the asylum seekers  debate, Labor stands on the brink of losing its identity.      

 The Labor Party I joined was a calling.  It thrived on a heady mixture of idealism and  justice.  Although compromise was common and perhaps even inevitable, the crackly  flame of idealism somehow always stayed bright.  Pragmatists and idealists have  always fought great battles inside the Labor Party.  Labor needs both in order to  succeed. Pragmatism without idealism is pointless, and idealism without pragmatism  is hopeless.  Idealism is now at a low ebb in modern Labor.  It is our task to revive it,  to inspire the dreams of a better society, to restore definition to Labor’s identity.   

 Our identity has been forged in the great battles of the past.  From conscription in  World War One to the Communist Party Dissolution referendum to the Vietnam War,  courageous and compassionate stands have defined who we are.  With such a history,  is it any wonder that since 2001 many Australians are asking who we are and what we  now stand for?   

 If you think I’m angry about the 2001 election, you’re right.  I’m angry with myself as  much as with others.  But I can’t allow such anger to consume me, and we must not  allow it to consume the Labor Party.   

 The great battles of principle of the past have never been as simple as they might  seem from afar.  Enormous internal convulsions were usually involved.  A large  section of the Labor Party left the party in order to support conscription in 1916.   Labor initially supported the Communist Party Dissolution Bill.  Many who believed  in that position left the party in 1955.  Labor was originally equivocal about the  Vietnam War.  Even our opposition to Australia's participation in the war in Iraq was  conditional.   

 Labor has always sought to marry principle with majority community support.  Sometimes that challenge overwhelms us.  We may regret our 2001 position on  asylum seekers, but there is no use wringing out hands about it now.  We have to  rebuild Labor idealism.  The answers to this challenge don’t lie in trying to re-fight  battles of the recent past.  They lie in imagining the future.   

 Labor’s great mistake since 1996 has been to focus too much on what is wrong with  the Howard Government and not enough on what is right for Australia.  For many  Australians, substantive differences between the major parties have diminished, while

 the intensity of political conflict has increased.  Violent language and macho  posturing are no substitute for vision.  Brutality in politics might entertain but it will  never persuade.  For Labor to recapture the spirit of idealism and vision we have to  rise above Punch and Judy politics.  Courage and compassion require content, not  calumny.   

 I want an Australia where compassion is an honoured ingredient in public life and  respect for rules and institutions is ingrained.  I want an Australia made up of open  markets and inclusive community institutions.  I want an Australia where taxes are  judged by the value they deliver, and not just the cost they entail.  I want an Australia  based on the principle of opportunity for all.  I want an Australia that offers a better  life and a larger future for our children.   

 Compassion for those who are struggling requires genuine courage.  Reviving Labor  idealism does not mean hunting about for symbolic issues on which to knock up a  manufactured emotional crusade.  It is about connecting with the realities of people's  lives.     

 And what are those core realities?  I want to outline several opportunities for Labor to  rekindle our idealism and connect with burning needs in our community.  Each theme  is ultimately about our children.  About their life opportunities, their health, the  support their parents are able to give them.   

 Protecting  low paid and casual workers.   

 The Australian economy is sustained by an  invisible army of  low paid and casual  workers who are struggling just to get by.  The rest of us benefit from the cheap  clothes, restaurants, cleaning services, financial services, laundry, transport and  entertainment they provide.  Labor market deregulation has certainly allowed some  workers to increase the rewards for their skills, but for many others it has meant being  pushed into the margins of our society.  For many Australian children it means  inadequate family income and insufficient parental involvement.   

 The statistics tell their story.  Only 61 per cent of workers have permanent full time  jobs.  And for the rest?  Since 1984 the percentage of casuals in our workforce has  increased from 16 per cent to 27 per cent, with roughly half having no sick leave, no  paid holidays and that's even if they have worked in the same place for over a year.   These workers suffer insecure employment, low hourly rates, inadequate training and  hours that can almost destroy family life.  Some told their stories recently at the  Senate Poverty Inquiry.  A common theme was bosses reducing working hours to  counteract wage increases, while still expecting the same work to be done.   

 Outsourcing and Australia Workplace Agreements have created even more low-paid  workers trapped in a cycle of faster work, longer hours and shrinking pay.  Australia  is gradually creating a working underclass like the United States, so graphically  described by Barbara Ehrenreich in her book  Nickel and Dimed:  On (Not) Getting by  in America.   

 These workers are almost always overlooked in public debate.  Whenever I see yet  another survey of small business attitudes to unfair dismissal laws, I ask myself: what 

 

 

 C:\Documents and Settings\ASPDENA\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\OLK43A\Arthur Calwell Speech.pic.doc 

 do sacked workers think?  Dismissal can be devastating for vulnerable workers.  It  can trigger prolonged unemployment, poverty, depression, family breakdown, and  even suicide.  Yet no-one ever surveys workers about the merits of unfair dismissal  laws.   

 So it is with low - paid workers generally.  This invisible army keeps the wheels of  our economy turning, but to the Howard Government they are merely an economic  input, a cost to business, not people.  Liberals regard the contract of employment as  just another contract, to be determined by the market.  Labor sees it as the cornerstone  of our society, the measure of our living standards and self-worth.   

 Protecting vulnerable workers is core business for the Labor Party.   

 Some labour market deregulation has been unavoidable because of major changes in  the production process, but there is no excuse for allowing more and more workers to  drift into poverty.  Improving their living standards will not harm our international  competitiveness, but it will strengthen social cohesion and opportunity.  Article 7 of  the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by  Australia in 1975, empowers the Australian Parliament to make laws providing for  fair minimum wages and working conditions.  Labor should use this power to  legislate for leave entitlements for casuals, permanent employment options and better  minimum rates of pay.  The award system can no longer carry the entire load of  protecting vulnerable workers.  It’s time for some direct legislative intervention.   

 Bringing Dental Services into Medicare   

 Australia once had the best health system in the world.  Now the Howard Government  is pulling it apart.  Labor is committed to defending Medicare.  We should also aim to  extend it.   

 After the Keating Government introduced the Commonwealth Dental Scheme in  1993, community health centres in my electorate  told me they were seeing dental  patients in their 50s who had never been to a dentist before.  The Howard Government  axed this program in 1996.  It has done nothing since to deal with this gaping hole in  our health system.     

 For many Australians, proper dental care is an unaffordable luxury.  If you haven’t  got private health insurance or a health card, you can face a choice between enormous  bills or enormous queues.  From 1989 to 1999 dental fees rose by 50 per cent while  the overall  cost of health services rose by only 22 per cent.  Too many Australians  suffer prolonged pain and misery because they cannot afford dentists' fees.  Too many  families with children face great financial pressures from dental bills.   

 Labor is reviewing the future of the Howard Government’s wasteful and regressive  private health insurance rebate.  Basic dental services could be included in Medicare  for little more than a third of the cost of the rebate.  It already pays for a least $264  million in dental services, but only for those with private health insurance. There are  other reform options to be considered, but ensuring basic dental cover for all  Australians would relieve the pressure on thousands of Australian families.  Dental  into Medicare should be our objective.  How simple, bold and positive is that?

 Putting Public Education First    

 Families these days are paying twice for education - once through their taxes and  again though user pays arrangements.  Two thirds of the Howard Government's  school funding goes immediately to private schools.  The Government spends more  on private schools than it does on public universities.        

 Children educated in an increasingly under-funded public system who go to university  will face a debt equivalent to a second mortgage.  That's if they are lucky enough to  have scored a place in the beginning!   

 How often do we hear right-wing commentators lecture lower income Australians  about the evils of middle class welfare?  They never apply this critique to private  school funding. The Howard Government is lavishing millions of extra dollars on our  wealthiest private schools.  The families who benefit are mostly well off.  The  Howard Government is now creating a two - tier education system: a private system  overflowing with public funds, and a public system starved of adequate funding.   

 Much has been written in recent years on the collapse of the Australian Settlement of  a century ago.  One crucial aspect of this settlement has been overlooked - our  society’s commitment to free, compulsory and secular education.  Of all the elements  in that settlement - White Australia, compulsory arbitration, tariff protection -  universal education has been the most crucial and the most enduring.  It has  guaranteed opportunity for generations of Australian children.   

 It is Labor's task to ensure that our children are not denied their right to life  opportunities because of the gradual erosion of public education.  To guarantee  opportunity for all, our commitment to public education must always be paramount.  That means committing more resources for schools and universities, and vigorously  opposing the ever mounting flow of largesse to wealthy private schools.  If ever there  is to be  a line in the sand for Labor, this is it.   

 Caring for Carers   

  If you happen to be the parent of a child with cystic fibrosis or juvenile diabetes or  some other chronic illness, do not expect the Howard Government to give you much  help.   

 These parents make heroic sacrifices to care for their children.  They suffer loss of  sleep, loss of  income, loss of well being and loss of enjoyment of life.  The current  Carer's Allowance is a very modest acknowledgment of these sacrifices.  Yet even  that is under threat.   

 Let me give you an example.  A seven-year old girl at my children's school in Clifton  Hill suffers from complex congenital heart disease.  She has undergone eleven serious  heart operations and is always in and out of hospital.  She sees a bewildering array of  medical specialists.  Her fluid intake requires continuous monitoring.  As you can see,  looking after her requires extraordinary time and effort.  That time and effort is

 provided by a single person: her mum.  Just last week her mother was notified that her  Carer's Allowance is being withdrawn.   

 When the Government’s coffers are overflowing with record tax revenues, the sheer  viciousness of this crackdown on carers is almost beyond description.  We are a  civilized, affluent country.  Why are we unable to afford even this very limited  assistance for those who care for children with the most special needs?   

 Our society has to take greater responsibility for helping parents who are caring for  seriously disabled children.  We need to extend our assistance to carers and boost  resources for integration aides and special assistance in schools.  If ever there was a  genuine need for compassion from government this is it.   

 

 Throughout long years in opposition, Arthur Calwell’s courage and compassion   prevailed.  He weathered the 1955 Labor split, suffering such severe vilification that  he was forced to leave his local church.  He stood firm against the Australian  involvement in the Vietnam War.  He suffered electoral devastation but laid the  foundations for a generation of Labor resurgence.  He even narrowly escaped  assassination, but in typical fashion forgave his would be assassin.  Modern Labor  should draw inspiration from this spirit of determination and compassion.   

 In his book Labor's Role in Modern Society, Calwell described Labor as both a party  and a movement.  In defining Labor's fundamental objective as 'prosperity and justice'  he set out the core belief which has driven generations of Labor idealists:   

  'We believe that the human spirit is too noble a thing to be shackled for   a lifetime by harsh economic necessity.  At a time when our knowledge and  power have placed prosperity within the reach of everybody, we wish to see  each man and woman enabled to reach the high dignity of being a human  being, a child of God.'   

 In passing on the torch to Arthur Calwell, his predecessor as Member for Melbourne  Dr William Maloney described him as a devotee of  'the great religion of humanity'.   It is time to reignite the courage and compassion of Arthur Calwell and so many other  great Labor leaders of the past.  It is time to fight for vulnerable workers, to help  families under pressure, to support public education, to relieve the burden on carers.   It is time to revive Labor idealism and connect with the realities of people's lives.  Let  us commit again to that great religion of humanity.   

 A few weeks ago, my nine-year old daughter won $50 in a newspaper competition.   She told me she wanted to save the money until she is an adult, and then sponsor a  child from a poor country.  My heart leapt at this spontaneous display of compassion  from the child I love.  But then I thought of the many children in detention in our own  country.  I wondered how I could possibly explain to her that the children she wants  to help could be locked up if they came to Australia?    

 This dark period in Australia’s journey must not be allowed to prevail.  In a world where compassion is almost a dirty word and pragmatism has become an  end unto itself, let us unite to revive the idealism of Labor, honour the courage and

 conviction of Arthur Calwell, and harness the optimism and generosity of young  Australians.  We have it in our power to make a better world - let's do it!
