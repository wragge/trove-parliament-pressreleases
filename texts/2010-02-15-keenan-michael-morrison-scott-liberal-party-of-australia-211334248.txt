 ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS GO FROM BAD TO WORSE UNDER RUDD 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Joint Media Statement.  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and 

 Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today that the illegal arrival of the 12th boat this year highlights illegal 

 boat arrivals are going from bad to worse, with the rate of arrivals continuing to escalate, overwhelming 

 Government forecasts.  

 "The illegal arrival of yet another boat, this time with 50 people on board, intercepted south of Ashmore Islands, 

 brings this year's total to 12 boats and almost 700 people, Mr Morrison said  

 "In 2010 we have had as many people arrive in just six weeks as it took in almost six months in 2009, he said.  

 "Boats are now arriving illegally at the rate of 2 a week, at an average of more than 50 people on each boat. At 

 this rate we could see more than 100 boats arrive illegally this year, and more than 5,000 people. This would 

 eclipse all previous levels of illegal arrivals.  

 Mr Keenan said: "The Rudd Governments inability to deal with the crisis of illegal boat arrivals has again come to 

 the fore.  

 "Senate estimates revealed this week that the government seems more interested in ensuring that free line 

 dancing and yoga classes are offered at Christmas Island than ensuring our borders are protected from 

 unauthorized arrivals, he said.  

 Mr Morrison also said Senate Estimates had revealed that when preparing the 2009/10 Budget, Labor believed 

 just 200 people would arrive illegally by boat this financial year under their policies.  

 "After 1,000 people had turned up by last October, they thought only another 400 would come and asked for an 

 additional $132 million to cover the cost, he said.  

 "With this latest boat, well over 2,600 people have now illegally arrived and been taken to Christmas Island. The 

 Government will need to ask for another $100 million and the rest, by the time the year is done.  

 "It's simply unbelievable that the Rudd Government fails to understand what has always been clear to the 

 Australian people, that their policies are acting as a magnet for people smugglers.  

 "On Mr Rudd's watch, Christmas Island has become a visa factory for people smugglers.  

 Mr Morrison and Mr Keenan will join Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott at Darwin today to reiterate the Coalition's 

 commitment to border protection and offshore processing of asylum seekers.  

 With Christmas Island overflowing, Darwin will soon become the next destination for illegal arrivals under Labor's 

 soft policies, Mr Morrison said.  

 "The Coalition has a clear border protection record and it is a record we will prove once again, if elected to 

 government.
