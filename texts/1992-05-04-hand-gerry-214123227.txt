 M e d ia  Release, , ” :,, " ^ : r \ 'â¢. -."" . . . . " ,  \ , : . .  ' .Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs The Hon. Gerry Hand, MPmmmParliament House, Canberra, AC T2600 Telephone: (06) 277 7860MPS 25/92TRANSFER OF TEN CHINESE BOAT PEOPLE TO JAILThe Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, said today his Department had transferred ten Chinese boat people from Port Hedland to the State prison in Roebourne, W.A., to defuse a situation which threatened the safety of other detainees at the Port Hedland Processing Centre.The ten, including seven who had escaped from the Centre on the week-end of 25-26 April, were moved to Roebourne last Friday.Mr Hand described criticism of the move by Marion Le, President of the Indo-China Refugee Association of the ACT, as totally ill-informed and absurdly emotive.He said the transfer followed a re-assessment of security at the Port Hedland Centre, undertaken following the escape."The decision was taken after advice was received from the Australian Protective Service (APS) on security and safety issues," Mr Hand said (APS provides the guards at the Centre)."The escape was the final occurrence in a series of incidents which led to serious concerns for the safety of other residents of the Centre, and of staff and authorised visitors including the clergy, welfare workers and lawyers."Due to privacy constraints, I will not release details of the other incidents."But suffice it to say that when my Department receives advice from the professional body engaged to maintain security that it cannot guarantee the safety of people within the Centre, it has no option but to respond in an appropriate way.". .  .  /2COMMONWEALTHPARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY MIC AH

 Mr Hand said the Port Hedland facility was a low-security  one, providing a humane atmosphere appropriate to the needs  of the detainees.

 He had no wish to change this atmosphere by upgrading  security measures and instituting harsher rules for all when  only a few people were causing difficulties.

 In regard to claims that one of the transferees was "very  ill", the Minister said two of the ten were on routine  medication. Their on-going health needs would be well taken  care of in Roebourne Prison, as would their need for access 

 to lawyers and interpreters and other support services.
