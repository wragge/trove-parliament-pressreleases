 Migration program boosts economy and eases skills shortage 

 Friday 22 August 2008 

 A report by respected economic analyst Access Economics shows that new migrants  to Australia deliver hundreds of millions of dollars to the Commonwealth budget and  the broader economy every year. 

 In a speech to the Australian Mines and Metals Association in Perth today, the  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said that the overall  fiscal impact of migration is substantially positive and grows over time in real terms.  

 In its Migrant Fiscal Impact Model: 2008 Update, Access looked at the costs that  migrants impose on health, education, welfare, employment and settlement services  compared to the fiscal benefits from taxation and visa charges.  

 For the 2006-07 migration program, Access estimated a total benefit of $536 million  in the first year, then another $856 million in year two, growing steadily over time to  reach $1.34 billion by year 20.  

 ‘Applying the same modelling to the 2007-08 migration program, the net fiscal benefit  is $610 million in year one, $965 million in year two then growing to $1.5 billion by  year 20,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘The forecast for the 2008-09 migration program is for an $829 million benefit in the  first year, $1.16 billion in the second year, then $1.8 billion by year 20.’ 

 Senator Evans said the Access modelling dispelled the myth that new migrants  imposed a huge impost on the taxpayer. 

 ‘The positive fiscal impact is particularly pronounced for skilled migrants, which  reflects their high rate of labour market participation and higher incomes which in  turn leads to a high level of direct tax receipts,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘Migrants also contribute to the broader economy through spending on goods and  services. 

 ‘As well as the economic benefits, skilled migrants help Australian employers fill  critical labour gaps at a time many businesses are facing capacity constraints. 

 ‘The bottom line is that our migration program is vital to keep the economy growing  as well as helping Australian businesses overcome skills and labour shortages. 

 ‘Australia is facing a demographic shift that will see more people retire than join the  workforce so the permanent skilled migration program provides a stable, effective  and targeted source of skilled workers.’  

 Australia’s migration program increased annually over the last decade under the  previous government to the point where the 2007-08 migration program was the  biggest provided by Australia since the 1960s. 

 The 2007-08 migration program comprised 108 540 places (68 per cent) in the  skilled migration stream and 49 870 places (31 per cent) in the family migration  stream.  Another 13 000 refugee and humanitarian visas were granted in 2007-08. 

 Last year’s intake represents a seven per cent increase on the 2006-07 migration  program which totalled 158 960 places, of which two thirds (97 920) were skilled  migrants. 

 The 2008-09 migration and humanitarian program is expected to total 203 000 visa  grants, with 133 500 allocated for skilled migrants, 13 500 places for refugee and  humanitarian entrants and a further 56 500 places in the family stream.
