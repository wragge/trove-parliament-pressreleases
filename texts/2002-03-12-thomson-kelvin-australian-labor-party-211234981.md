 KELVIN THOMSONMedia Release from the Shadow Minister for Environment & Heritage OIL EXPLORATION NEAR GREAT BARRIER REEF

 The Government must rule out oil exploration that threatens the Great Barrier Reef, Labor’s Shadow Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Kelvin Thomson, said today.

 “If David Kemp has any genuine commitment to protecting the Great Barrier Reef he will now publicly rule out any drilling in the Townsville Trough, which is a mere 50 kilometres from the Reef World Heritage area.

 ”It is a matter of considerable public concern that that media reports over the weekend quote internal Queensland Government briefing papers as saying the Norwegian global seismic survey company TGS- NOPEC, would not be proceeding with its seismic testing without some comfort from the Federal Government ‘that the area would be later released for petroleum exploration, including drilling’.

 “In light of this information, for Dr. Kemp to fail to publicly rule out oil drilling in the Townsville Trough can only lead to the conclusion that the Howard Government is supporting TGS-NOPEC in their endeavours to drill for oil near the Great Barrier Reef.

 “After all, seismic testing is pointless without subsequent oil drilling, and the notion that the approvals now being sought constitute no threat to the Reef is naÃ¯ve in the extreme.

 “I reject claims that the exploration proposals can be entertained because they are not on the Reef itself.  Recent bitter experience, such as oil rigs sinking off Brazil, ship bunker fuel smearing the New Zealand coast, oil spills on the Galapagos, and oiled penguins on Phillip Island are testament that spills travel hundreds of kilometres.  There is also evidence that seismic testing itself can damage certain marine life.

 “It is not good enough for David Kemp to say that his hands are tied by the legislation and all he is doing is going through the process. I have no doubt that all it would take is one public statement from the Howard Government that oil drilling will not be allowed in the Townsville Trough, and the company would go away.

 “When a Norwegian vessel sought to bring in a load of asylum seekers into Australia last year the Howard Government called out the navy and introduced new legislation.  But when a Norwegian company wants to explore for oil just 50 kilometres from one of Australia’s greatest national treasures, the Government does nothing to stop it, and cites ‘due process’.
