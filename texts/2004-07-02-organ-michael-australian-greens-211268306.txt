 ORGAN LUNCHING WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS   

 Cunningham MP Michael Organ will be taking 25 asylum  seekers to lunch at the Nan Tien temple next Tuesday as part  of a campaign to encourage people to donate much needed  assistance to the Sydney-based Asylum Seekers Centre.

 “The Centre depends entirely on funding from non-government  sources and urgently needs donations of items such as phone  cards and study aids.”   

  “I am pleased to be able to help in a small way by taking this group  to lunch at the Nan Tien temple while they are enjoying a day out in  the Illawarra”, Mr. Organ said.   

 What:  Lunch with a group of asylum seekers  When:  1:30 - 2:30 pm Tuesday 6 July 2004  Where:  Nan Tien temple, off Berkeley Road Berkeley
