 Another boat off Ashmore Reef, and the Government continues to soften  policy 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 On the eve of the Rudd Government introducing the debate about the abolition of  detention debt for asylum seekers arriving in unauthorised boats, the 22nd boat  bought by people smugglers has been intercepted near Ashmore Reef with 49  passengers and four crew.  

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said there has  now been almost 800 asylum seekers arrivals by boat since the Rudd Labor  Government softened their immigration policy last August, with over 1000  intercepted on Australia’s behalf by the Indonesians.  

 “Now is not the time to further encourage the people smuggling with additional  enticements in the way of; the abolition of the concept of detention debt, the abolition  of the 45 day rule for asylum seeking on shore and the introduction of new  categories of protection visas to cater for those who currently receive access to  Ministerial intervention, but who do not meet the UNHCR criteria as refugees.”  

 “The Coalition continues to call for a comprehensive inquiry into the pull factors now  encouraging people smuggling, and an open and transparent process of inquiry into  the fate of the boat which exploded and killed and burned asylum seekers off the  northern coastline,” Dr Stone said.
