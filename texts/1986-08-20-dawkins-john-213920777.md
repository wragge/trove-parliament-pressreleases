 FEDERAL GRANTS FOR AUSTRALIAN YOUTH ORGANISATIONS

 The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Youth 

 Affairs, John Dawkins, today announced grants valued at 

 $812,480 for a range of national youth projects under 

 the Program of Assistance to Youth Organisations 

 (P A Y O ).

 Mr Dawkins said the PAYO scheme for which $1.0m was 

 allocated in the Budget was designed to help non­

 Government youth organisations strengthen and develop 

 their programs and services for young people.

 "The largest grant of $300,000 will go to the peak 

 council of the youth sector, the Youth Affairs Council 

 of Australia (YACA), to enable it to continue to 

 represent youth organisations and young people at tne 

 national level and to provide more effective advice to 

 Government on young people's concerns", Mr Dawkins 

 said. The grant to YACA maintains the allocation made 

 last year for core secretariat purposes

 "This year" the Minister said, "particular attention 

 has been given to projects which aim to help 

 disadvantaged young people".  He went on to say that 

 grants are to be provided to help Aboriginals and 

 Torres Strait Islanders, young people of various ethnic 

 backgrounds, young refugees and other young people with 

 disabilities or from disadvantaged backgrounds.

 The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 

 Youth Council is;to receive assistance of $40,000 to 

 give.Aboriginal young people a national network through 

 which they can participate in youth development. The 

 Council was established as a result of a National 

 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Youth Conference 

 held in Canberra in March this year.

 PRESS  RELEASE

 Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Australia will receive a ·  

 grant of $85,627 to enable it to develop its services 

 for young people suffering from difficult family 

 backgrounds such as parental illness, financial 

 problems,  alcoholism and mental health problems.  Big 

 Brothers/Big Sisters’  programs aim to combat poor social 

 skills, poor esteem, delinquency, withdrawal symptoms 

 and similar disadvantages suffered by young people from 

 such family situations.

 Mr Dawkins said that, "Apart from funding for 

 disadvantaged projects, PAYO grants are being provided 

 for a range of projects which match the variety of young 

 people's needs and aspirations." He added that the 

 substantial level of funding provided under PAYO 

 reflected the Government’s recognition of the importance 

 of the non-Government youth sector and its contribution 

 towards major social development in Australia.

 Mr Dawkins said that a further round of grants would be 

 considered soon,  following clarification of several 

 applications made under PAYO. The Office of Youth 

 Affairs is pursuing outstanding issues with some 

 organisations so that additional grants might be 

 finalised from within funds available as soon as 

 possible.
