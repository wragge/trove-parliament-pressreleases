 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday, 2 September 2014    

 Cuts to Red Cross refugee support will send families into poverty    

 Short-sighted cuts to the Migration Support Program, which will see 500 Red Cross  employees lose their jobs, will dump thousands of refugees into poverty, the Australian  Greens have said.    

 “The safety net was already under stress and now the government is ripping it to  pieces,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Asylum seekers waiting for their refugee claims to be processed should be given work  rights now, so that they’re not reliant on this type of support. The government expects  charity organisations to pick up the slack, but that has put them under unprecedented  pressure.    

 “These drastic cuts to Red Cross’ funding will put 500 people out of a job and will leave  many refugees with no place to go.    

 “Refugee families with children are struggling to survive in the community already and  now many, many more will simply fall through the cracks.”
