 Translated material available to assist vulnerable women 

 Vulnerable women from a range of backgrounds will be able to access information regarding the Second  Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022 in their  native language, with materials now available in 12 languages other than English.   

 The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash said the provision  of and access to this information was a critical step forward.   

 “We know that different groups of women have diverse experiences of violence,” Minister Cash said.   

 “Women who come to Australia as migrants, refugees or international students can face unique  challenges and so it is important that Government make resources available in a wide range of languages  so that those at risk have the information they require.”   

 Minister for Social Services Kevin Andrews said the Second Action Plan has a particular focus on women  from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and particular consideration was given to how  different communities could be most appropriately supported.    

 “It is vital that those from different backgrounds have easy access to material that helps them  understand their rights in Australia but importantly, women at risk need readily available information to  assist them escape domestic or sexual violence,” Mr Andrews said.    

 The translated editions of the Second Action Plan brochure and the culturally and linguistically diverse  fact sheet are just one element of how women from diverse backgrounds are being specifically targeted  for additional assistance.    

 Other forms of assistance include additional funding for the White Ribbon Foundation to increase  engagement, the development of resource materials to inform and support women on an overseas  spouse visa, working with The Line to create special resources and specific targeting of damaging cultural  practices unique to some communities, such as Female Genital Mutilation and Child Marriages.
