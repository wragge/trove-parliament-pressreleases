 The Australian Greens   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 10 April 2015   

 Government wasting taxpayer money on asylum seeker  propaganda film   

 The Australian Greens have slammed the Abbott Government for planning to use $4 million of taxpayer  money to fund a new telemovie that seeks to deter asylum seekers coming to Australia, telling them  instead to remain in warzones.     

 “This is more Abbott Government propaganda paid for by the Australian taxpayer,” Greens Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “This is a shameless abuse of tax payer funds.    

 “With the brutal conflicts in Syria and Iraq the only message we are sending refugee families caught up  in the  violence is ‘bugger off, Australia does not care about your suffering’.   

 “This will do nothing to help improve Australia's standing in the international community.    

 “We should be doing more to help address the refugee crisis by offering safe avenues to Australia not  turning our backs on those in need telling people we don't care what happens to them.”
