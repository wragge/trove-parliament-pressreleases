 Operation Sovereign Borders monthly update: July 2016 

 19-08-2016 -  

 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to  the off-water reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals. 

 The reporting period is from 1 July 2016 to 31 July 2016. 

 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian  Immigration authorities. 

 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing countries. 

 Three illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. Two illegal  maritime arrival detainees were involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of  origin. Their removal from Australia is consistent with Australia's obligations. 

 One illegal maritime arrival transferee voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a  regional processing country. 

 As at 31 July 2016, there were a total of 833 people in Manus Island RPC and 411 people in  Nauru RPC. With the opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now  permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on those still living in the RPC will therefore be  fluid. 

 Of the 1,015 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 511 were  positive and 504 were negative as at 31 July 2016. There were 555 refugees who have been  given a positive final determination. 

 Of the 1,196 Current Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 924 were  positive and 272 were negative as at 31 July 2016. 

 Indonesian authorities have recently arrested two people in Sukabumi for alleged facilitator  involvement in people smuggling activity.
