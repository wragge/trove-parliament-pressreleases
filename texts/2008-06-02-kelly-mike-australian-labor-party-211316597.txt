 Funding for local community settlement   The Member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, has welcomed about $135,000  to be spent in the electorate over the next two financial years on assisting  integration of refugees and migrants.   

 The Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre Inc (QMLC) has been allocated  $65,200 in 2008-09 with another $69,528 in 2009-10.   

 A total of $34 million will be spent on 230 projects from 168 organisations  around Australia in 2008-09 as part of the Settlement Grants Program  (SGP).   

 Of this, approximately $22m is available to fund new projects, while the  remaining $10m is for ongoing grant commitments.    

 Dr Kelly said the program is aimed at helping refugees and migrants to  become self-reliant, contribute to the economy and acquire the life skills  and knowledge to settle in Australia.   

 “The projects will assist migrants and refugees in their cultural transition  and build on their existing skills for their successful settlement”, he said.    

 “Migrants and refugees will also be helped in overcoming barriers to  accessing private rental housing accommodation which most face without  rental history or referees in Australia.”   

 Dr Kelly said organisations funded through the program, such as QMLC,  should be commended for their contribution to the positive and successful  settlement of migrants and refugees in Australia.
