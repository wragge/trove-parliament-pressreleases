 ROBERT MCCLELLAND MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   

 Address to Mayo Iraq Community Forum 

 South Australia 

 23 July 2007 

 

 Introduction 

 

 Australians are proud citizens. 

 

 At any school presentation night one of the most prestigious awards is the 

 citizenship award. 

 

 At virtually every local government Australia Day presentation, again, one of 

 the most prestigious awards is for citizen of the year. 

 

 Australians are therefore quite distressed when they learn that one of the first 

 acts of Alexander Downer as Minister for Foreign Affairs was to remove from 

 all foreign affairs documentation the stated objective of Australia being a good 

 international citizen. 

 

 An examination of the Government's record shows that this deletion was 

 intentional.  During the period Mr Downer has held the office of Minister for 

 Foreign Affairs, our reputation as a good International citizen has been 

 severely damaged by the Howard Government. 

 

 Reputation is vitally important on the international stage. It is important not 

 only for our pride and self-respect as a people but because it is in our national 

 self-interest.  In the international sphere reputation is everything when it 

 comes to trade, the ability to open doors and ultimately to influence. 

 

  1

 Tonight I intend to focus with you on the three issues of the loss of Australia’s 

 international reputation, the Government’s strategic ineptness in Iraq and their 

 culpability for the AWB scandal. 

 

 

 Loss of international reputation 

 

 The Howard Government no longer aspires to reach the standards of 

 international agreements and instruments.  Indeed we have seen repeated 

 attacks on international treaty monitoring bodies that have pointed this out.   

 

 The Government’s criticism has even descended to personal attacks 

 including, for instance, Mr Downer’s bitter attack on former United Nations 

 Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson when she described Australia’s 

 policy of detaining asylum seeking children at Woomera here in South 

 Australia as being “inhumane and degrading”.  

 

 The Government has also refused to sign the UN optional protocol against 

 torture because of a fear that our detention centres and prisons would be 

 subject to inspection by international experts. 

 

 How can we insist that totalitarian regimes undertake reform when we don’t 

 have the integrity to allow our prisons and detention centres to be inspected 

 and assessed against international standards? 

 

 Mr Downer’s tolerance of the military commission trial of fellow 

 South Australian David Hicks was a dangerous abandonment of the 

 fundamental rights of an Australian citizen.  Irrespective of the charges 

 against David Hicks he was entitled to have a Foreign Minister that stood up 

 for his right to a fair trial.  

 

 Why was it that the British Government was prepared to defend the rights of 

 its citizens to a fair trial but our Foreign Minister repeatedly defended the 

 indefensible? 

  2

 

 Obstructing international efforts on climate change 

 

 On climate change we have been described as “a pariah” in the international 

 press after being given generous carbon concessions, signing the Kyoto 

 protocol then subsequently refusing to ratify it.  

 

 The UN Association Report Card released last week states the Australian 

 performance on climate change: 

 

 ”Has not only fallen far short of the expectations of the business 

 community and the people of Australia but has also fallen short of the 

 international expectations for Australia to support global action to 

 reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” 

 

 I’m not sure of the extent to which Mr Downer may have been influenced by 

 Borat but 172 countries have now ratified Kyoto - three major countries still 

 refuse to ratify: USA, Australia and Kazakhstan.  

 

 The blatant hypocrisy of Mr Downer’s position on Kyoto borders on the 

 ridiculous.  He says Kyoto is flawed, espouses the need for global climate 

 change agreements, and then brags that Australia is meeting its Kyoto targets 

 anyway.  

 

 The reality is that Australian carbon emissions per person is one of the 

 highest in the world, with the average Australian consuming 10 times more 

 energy per person than the average Indian and five times more than the 

 average Chinese.  Australia is simply abrogating our international 

 responsibility not to ratify the Kyoto protocol and not acting in concert with the 

 international community to reduce our carbon emissions. 

 

 Our failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol will mean that if the Howard 

 Government is re-elected later this year we will have no meaningful role in the 

 next phase of global negotiations in Bali in December.  Specifically the 

  3

 Government’s own submission to the UN notes that we won’t have voting 

 rights.  Mr Downer would have us like the cockies on the Arnott’s biscuit tin - 

 always on the outside. 

 

 Government’s obsession to pursue nuclear power 

 

 Just last week evidence came to light that Mr Downer has been secretly 

 negotiating with the United States for Australia to become more actively 

 involved in the nuclear power industry.   

 

 It is unclear whether those negotiations include making Australia - and 

 possibly South Australia - a repository for spent nuclear fuel used by the rest 

 of the world.  Mr Downer's public statements were to the effect that the 

 negotiations are important to ensure the effective regulation of nuclear 

 material.  If that is the case why has the Government's record on the issue of 

 nuclear non-proliferation been so pathetic? 

 

 An examination of the Government’s UN voting record shows it has opposed 

 or abstained from supporting a number of important resolutions in the area of 

 non-proliferation and disarmament.  This UN voting record contrasts markedly 

 with the efforts of the previous Labor Government. 

 

 In short, on the issues of international citizenship, climate change and nuclear 

 non-proliferation Mr Downer gets a fail. 

 

 The strategic ineptness of the Iraq war  

 

 It is reported that the war in Iraq has killed between 400,000 to 600,000 

 people - whatever the precise figure by any measure it’s a horrendous loss of 

 innocent lives.  It has resulted in 2 million people being internally displaced 

 and it has created 2 million refugees from Iraq.  It has created massive 

 instability in the Middle East including substantially increasing the influence of 

 Iran. 

 

  4

 Information obtained since the 2003 invasion shows that the Howard 

 Government had been told that the invasion was likely to enhance the 

 international recruitment of terrorists, was more likely to make Australia a 

 terrorist target and that the instability caused to the broader Middle East was 

 likely to increase petrol prices. 

 

 Why therefore are we involved in the Iraq civil war? 

 

 Mr Downer has given a rolling number of reasons: 

 

 â¢ Non-existent weapons of mass destruction 

 â¢  Regime  change  

 â¢ Establishing a beach head of democracy in the Middle East 

 â¢ Protecting Japanese army engineers 

 â¢ A role of ‘security overwatch’ 

 

 More recently your local member appeared to support the Defence Minister’s 

 view that oil security was a factor but then a couple of days later denied it was 

 a factor at all. 

 

 Misleading rhetoric about Australia’s role in Iraq 

 

 The bottom line is that Mr Downer is incredibly misleading about our role in 

 Iraq. 

 

 He spends more time talking about Al Qaeda and terrorists in Iraq than any of 

 his Ministerial colleagues.  We did a quick count during a recent interview with 

 Sky News on 6 July - in a five minute Friday afternoon interview about our 

 involvement in Iraq Alexander Downer mentioned Al Qaeda 16 times and 

 terrorists a further 4 times.   

 

 The first point I would make is that there was no evidence of any viable 

 presence of Al Qaeda terrorists in Iraq before the invasion. 

  5

 

 The second point I would make is that Australian troops in Iraq are not 

 engaged in fighting Al Qaeda terrorists. 

 

 Our combat troops in southern Iraq - officially known as the Overwatch Battle 

 Group West - are in an essentially Shi'ite area.  Whereas the evidence shows 

 the Al Qaeda in Iraq is a smaller part of the Sunni Iraqi insurgency - who 

 primarily operate in the Sunni Triangle in western Iraq and in and around 

 Baghdad. 

 

 Moreover, security in the southern Iraqi provinces of Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar 

 was handed over to the Iraqis in July and December respectively last year.  In 

 fact, not once have Australian soldiers been called out to back up the Iraqi 

 forces in their so-called 'overwatch' role. 

 

 Now, I want to make absolutely clear that Labor recognises that Australian 

 soldiers always perform their duties with tremendous professionalism, 

 courage and commitment that make us all proud.  But let me refer to the 

 words of the soldiers themselves. This is what one Australian soldier said to 

 the Defence Minister while he was visiting our troops in April of this year.  The 

 digger said: 

 

 “There's really a very real sense that our forces are being withheld from 

 actual combat roles with the exception of the SF [Special Forces]. I 

 think that some of our coalition partners are starting to certainly make 

 comment on the ground to soldiers about that.” 

 

 On the other hand there is no question our troops are fighting Al Qaeda 

 terrorists in Afghanistan.  It’s very dangerous and they need every available 

 resource.  While ever our focus is split we are not giving them every available 

 resource to assist them in a very dangerous mission.  Mr Downer, as much as 

 anyone, is responsible for this misallocation of security priorities. 

 

 Rejection of US requests for an expanded role in Iraq 

  6

 

 While Alexander Downer will avoid acknowledging it at all costs, his 

 Government has in fact rejected official US requests to deploy Australian 

 Army trainers from southern Iraq north to Baghdad to embed with Iraq 

 Security Forces.  

 

 We know this is the case through off-the-record sources but also public 

 comment by the Defence Minister who was forced to admit the request 

 rejection in an interview on the Sunday program with Laurie Oakes on 

 25 March this year.  In this interview Oakes asked Nelson:  

 

 “Have we been asked to consider embedding ADF trainers with Iraqi 

 security forces in Baghdad? 

 

 Nelson replied:   

 

  “Well, there was some discussion last year about embedding our 

 security … our trainers, if you like, with combat forces.” 

 

 When Oakes asked: “Why did we decline that request?” Nelson explained that 

 it was because the Government “are not going to risk our own people”. 

 

 Here in Adelaide earlier this month Mr Downer was hit with a series of 

 questions in an unrelated press conference about this rejection of the US 

 approach.  He denied he knew of any such request.  Further evidence of the 

 Government’s disarray on Iraq. 

 

 Danger of open ended commitment 

 

 The final point to discuss about Iraq is the fact that the Howard Government is 

 giving an open ended and open chequebook commitment to an Iraqi 

 administration that appears unable and even unwilling to get its own house in 

 order.   

 

  7

 The war in Iraq has now gone on longer than the Second World War.  Even 

 Republican members of Congress have firmly expressed the need to change 

 course in Iraq.  Mr Downer should be honest and upfront about the Iraqi 

 Government’s failings.     

 

 An important status report released by the White House earlier this month is 

 clear evidence of how the absence of an effective national government is the 

 number one problem in this civil war.   In other words all the troops you can 

 muster won’t end the violence in Iraq - it requires a political solution. 

 

 This is what a widely reported editorial in the New York Times, perhaps the 

 most respected newspaper in the United States, stated on Sunday 8 July - it 

 was titled ‘The Road Home’: 

 

 The political leaders Washington has backed [in Iraq] are incapable of 

 putting national interests ahead of sectarian score settling. The security 

 forces Washington has trained behave more like partisan militias. 

 Additional military forces poured into the Baghdad region have failed to 

 change anything. Continuing to sacrifice the lives and limbs of 

 American soldiers is wrong. The war is sapping the strength of the 

 nation's alliances and its military forces. It is a dangerous diversion 

 from the life-and-death struggle against terrorists. It is an increasing 

 burden on American taxpayers, and it is a betrayal of a world that 

 needs the wise application of American power and principles.  

 

 Probably nothing in the entire Iraq debate is as important as this issue.   

 

 The fatal flaw with Mr Downer and Mr Howard's policy on Iraq is that it is 

 based on continuing to make open ended and unconditional military 

 commitments to a government in Iraq that simply is not fulfilling its side of the 

 bargain.   

 

 Indeed, reports suggest that elements of the Iraq administration are actually 

 providing militia leaders with a hit list of potential victims. 

  8

 

 This is why the expert and bipartisan Baker-Hamilton report recommended a 

 phased withdrawal. It would mean that as allied forces depart, the Iraqis will 

 be compelled to step up to the plate. 

 

 Only the degree of pressure brought about by a phased withdrawal will force 

 the Iraqis to put their own house in order. Our Government’s approach is 

 flawed because it denies this reality. 

 

 Starting the Iraq war more than 4 years ago has now cost Australian 

 taxpayers more than $2 billion, demonstrated a massive failure of post-invasion planning, has increased the terrorist threat, spilt our soldiers instead 

 of consolidating them where best deployed and is widely considered to be the 

 biggest national security mistake since the Vietnam War. 

 

 The Iraq policy Alexander Downer still defends has become a stubborn 

 exercise in strategic ineptness, tied up in cheap political rhetoric and ignoring 

 the fact that it is a huge dollar and opportunity cost from addressing major 

 national security priorities in Afghanistan and closer to home. 

 

 Incompetent administration: the AWB disgrace 

 

 One of the reasons given by Prime Minister Howard for participating in the 

 invasion of Iraq was the failure of United Nations sanctions.  Yet history has 

 shown that an Australian company, that was originally an Australian 

 Government instrumentality, was the biggest rorter of those UN sanctions - 

 paying some $300 million to the regime of Saddam Hussein.   

 

 That rorting occurred at a time that Australian servicemen and women were 

 risking their personal safety in the Persian Gulf to enforce the United Nations 

 sanctions. 

 

 Insofar as the failure of the UN sanctions was used to justify invasion - an 

 invasion which caused the catastrophe that is Iraq - this must surely make the 

  9

 fact that an Australian company was the world champion rorter a matter of 

 enormous national significance. 

 

 Wheat growers from this region of South Australia will be horrified to know 

 that funds collected from the sale of their wheat were used to make illicit 

 payments to the regime of Saddam Hussein. 

 

 In fact on 20 June this year when the Parliament was debating legislation 

 related to wheat marketing the Member for your neighbouring electorate to the 

 East - the Member for Barker - understandably indicated that local wheat 

 growers had suffered some hard knocks. 

 

 Those hard knocks referred to arise directly from the actions of the AWB. 

 

 You should all be aware that the person responsible for granting the export 

 licence to AWB was Alexander Downer. The licence could have been 

 withdrawn at any time and the Minister was entitled to seek additional 

 information at any time as a condition to the granting of that licence.  

 

 Mr Downer has never accepted responsibility for the fact that he presided 

 over a Department that received more than 30 separate warnings about 

 AWB’s activities. He is yet to accept any responsibility for his administrative 

 failures in respect to AWB.   

 

 No senior bureaucrat has been disciplined. And Mr Downer is yet to fix the 

 obviously broken communication bridge between his office and his 

 Department.  This would seem an imperative given the Minister’s continuing 

 claims that he wasn’t told or adequately warned. 

 

 I would refer you to the work of Caroline Overington, in her book titled 

 Kickback, which documents the warnings given to the department of the 

 Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

 

 In summary, evidence before the Cole commission of inquiry established that; 

  10

 

 â¢ The Australian intelligence community reported concerns about AWB in 

 cables sent as far back as 1998 to the Department of Foreign Affairs 

 and Trade.  

 

 â¢ As early as 1999 Australian diplomats in Jordan knew that AWB was 

 getting favoured treatment for undisclosed help to the Iraq regime.  

 

 â¢ In 2000 Astride representatives in Washington reported continuing 

 concerns about ‘irregular’ payments between AWB and the Iraq Grains 

 Board.  

 

 â¢ From 2003 Australian representatives within the Coalition Provincial 

 Authority in Iraq received investigating instructions about kickbacks.  

 This indicated there was lukewarm knowledge that AWB had been 

 rorting the weapons for food program.  

 

 â¢ In 2004 an Australian representative on the Coalition Provincial 

 Authority, Colonel Mike Kelly, informed the Australian embassy in 

 Baghdad:  “the jig is up on AWB” and told the Iraq task force: “AWB 

 were up to their eyeballs in the illicit payments”. 

 

 If a senior military officer provides advice about the activities of AWB, advice 

 that was provided in the clearest of terms, why didn’t the Minister’s 

 Department act at the highest level?  

 

 Just as importantly why hasn’t the Minister insisted that people be hauled over 

 the coals for the failure? 

 

 According to any standard of basic administrative competence, he should 

 have done so.  

 

  11

 This unprecedented UN sanction busting corruption scandal was the subject 

 of the Cole Commission of Inquiry.   Commissioner Cole handed down his 

 findings on AWB more than 7 months ago.  It is a disgrace that we still haven’t 

 seen any associated prosecutions and won’t until after the forthcoming 

 election. 

 

 The limited terms of reference of the Cole Commission 

 

 Mr Downer now uses the Cole Commission’s findings as his one and only 

 shield to defend charges of administrative failure.  

 

 But his defence doesn’t stack up.  The scope of the Cole Commission was 

 deliberately limited. 

 

 Under its terms of reference - carefully constructed by the Government - the 

 Cole Commission was not charged with the responsibility for examining 

 misconduct or neglect of duty on the part of Ministers of the Crown (or indeed 

 even public servants). 

 

 Commissioner Cole states on page 22 of Volume 4 of his report, that under 

 the terms of reference: 

 

 “It is immaterial that the Commonwealth may have had the means or 

 ability to find out that the information was misleading, or that it ought 

 reasonably to have known that the information was misleading.” 

 

 That is of course, the misleading information provided by AWB. He continued: 

 

 “It is also immaterial that the Commonwealth, at the time it conferred 

 the benefit or advantage, suspected but did not know that the 

 information was misleading ... accordingly, the question whether the 

 Commonwealth may have had constructive knowledge (in the sense 

 that it ought reasonably to have known the truth or that it have the 

 means and ability to find out the truth) is immaterial.” 

  12

 

 The reference by Commissioner Cole to the benefit was the permission given 

 to AWB to export to Iraq. Again, as noted, this permission was given by the 

 Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

 

 The concept of constructive knowledge is significant. In the 1992 case of 

 Baden it was determined: 

 

 “Constructive knowledge may be imputed where a person wilfully shuts 

 his or her eyes to the obvious, wilfully and recklessly fails to make such 

 inquiries as an honest and reasonable person would make, has 

 knowledge of circumstances that would indicate the facts to a honest 

 and reasonable person, or has knowledge of the circumstances which 

 would put an honest and reasonable person on inquiry.” 

 

 On those criteria voters in Mayo may give careful consideration as to whether 

 their local member acted as such an honest and reasonable person in respect 

 to the AWB matter.  

 

 Your community may also give consideration as to whether the Minister for 

 Foreign Affairs has lived up to the principles of ministerial responsibility that is 

 at the heart of our system of Government.   

 

 In Caroline Overington’s book Kickback she states: 

 

 “Under normal, or at least, the historical rules of ministerial 

 accountability, Downer would have been booted off the front bench. It 

 was Howard not Cole who decided for him to keep his job… If the buck 

 didn’t stop with Downer, where did it stop? Why didn’t he resign? There 

 is only one possible answer; Downer cared more about his own job 

 than he cared about the integrity of his office. He somehow managed 

 to convince himself that the doctrine of ministerial responsibility did not 

 apply.  And so in January 2007, almost a year to the day after the Cole 

 inquiry began, there he was in Manhattan. Photographs captured the 

  13

 moment: he was wearing a tux and grinning like a loon, hamming it up 

 with the Wiggles. 

 

 Under the principles of ministerial responsibility - the buck stops with the 

 Minister.  The AWB scandal has blighted Australia’s international reputation 

 and harmed the economic interests of Australian wheat growers in this region, 

 across South Australia and across the country.  The Wiggles imagery must 

 surely disgust our hard working farmers. 

 

 Time to account 

 

 In conclusion, on the important issues of international relations and national 

 security the Howard Government has let the Australian people down.  

 

 Your local member has been the Minister at the helm of those important 

 issues for the duration of the Howard Government.  And in a democracy it is 

 you who can hold your local member to account. 

 

 Voters are entitled to ask whether Mr Downer has lived up to their 

 expectations as a Minister and as their representative in Federal Parliament.  

 

 Specifically voters are entitled to ask whether he has reflected their values in 

 downgrading our reputation as a good international citizen.  

 

 Voters are entitled to insist that the Government and Mr Downer personally 

 take responsibility for the disaster that is Iraq. Voters are also entitled to 

 question whether the rhetoric of staying the course with a failing stately in Iraq 

 represents strength of leadership or a stubborn refusal to recognise reality.  

 

 Finally, voters will note that the biggest bribery scandal in Australia’s history   

 took place on Mr Downer’s watch. The fact that the Minister primarily 

 responsible for overseeing AWB’s exports won’t take responsibility for the 

 shameful episode is your local member will give the voters of Mayo a special 

 reason to reflect at this election.  

  14

 

 In summary, Mayo voters will inevitably ask whether Mr Downer has earned 

 the right to continue as your representative in our national parliament.
