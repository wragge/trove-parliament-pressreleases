 Senator Vicki Bourne Australian Democrats Spokesperson on Defence and Foreign Affairs 19th Sep 2001     MEDIA RELEASE 01/546 32

 Will the Tampa Crisis become the Nauru Affair?

 The Australian Democrats fear the $20 million in sweeteners allocated to the Nauru  government  in  exchange  for  housing  the  Tampa  refugees  may  be misspent.

 “There are serious allegations about a senior Nauru Government figure being involved  in  the  misappropriation  of  funds,”  the  Democrats  foreign  affairs spokesperson, Senator Vicki Bourne said.

 “According  to  the  OECD,  Nauru  could  well  be  one  of  the  world’s  leading money laundering centres. This tiny country of only 12,000 people has more than  400  banks.  In  1998  it  received  over  US$70  billion  in  deposits  from Russia.  Much  of  this  laundered  money  could  be  linked  to  organised  crime, terrorist and other illegal activities.”

 “A recent OECD report has found its efforts to crack down on this unsavoury practice totally inadequate,” Senator Bourne said.

 In  question  time  in  the  Senate  today  Senator  Bourne,  asked  Senator  Hill  to confirm  the  amount  the  Nauru  operation  will  cost  and  of  the  safeguards  to ensure transparency and accountability.

 “Senator Hill entirely avoided my question,” Senator Bourne said.

 “Not  only  has  the  Government  refused  to  say  how  much  the  operation  will cost,  they  have  refused  to  give  any  guarantee  that  they  have  put  in  place controls to ensure the money won’t be misspent.” Senator Bourne said.

 “The  Howard  Government’s  attempt  to  export  Australia’s  responsibilities  for the Tampa  refugees  may  backfire  if  it  is  found  to  have  failed  to  prevent Australian money from being misappropriated,” Senator Bourne said.
