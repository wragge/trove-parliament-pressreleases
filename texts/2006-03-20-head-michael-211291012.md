 Paper presented at ‘The war on terror and civil liberties: Is Australia becoming a police state?’  seminar at University of Western Sydney Law School, 20 March 2006   

 The 2005 Anti-Terrorism legislation: a further step toward a police state   

 Dr Michael Headâ   

 

 Some may consider the title of this seminar provocative or exaggerated.   

 But as we recorded in the editorial to last year’s special edition of the University of Western  Sydney Law Review, a number of prominent legal commentators drew the conclusion that the  anti-terrorism legislation passed late last year by the federal and state parliaments contained  police state features.1 

 Our editorial quoted the president of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission,  John von Doussa, who said: 

 It might sound over-dramatic to say that the proposed laws are of the kind that may  identify a police state, but let us reflect for a moment on that proposition. The  defining characteristic of a police state is that the police exercise power on behalf of  the executive, and the conduct of the police cannot be effectively challenged through  the justice system. Regrettably, that is exactly what the laws which are currently  under debate will achieve.2 

 A former prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, made a similar judgment in a lecture delivered at  the State Library of Victoria last October. He said:   

 These are powers whose breadth and arbitrary nature, with lack of judicial oversight,  should not exist in any democratic country. If one says, but they will not be abused, I  do not agree. If arbitrary power exists, it will be abused.3   

 Mr Fraser observed that the government was really saying, ‘trust us’. His answer was as  follows: ‘[N]o part of the Coalition’s invasion and occupation of Iraq gives any member of  that coalition the right to say on these issues: ‘Trust us’.’   

 The former prime minister referred to the lies about weapons of mass destruction that could  be dropped on London within 45 minutes. He also referred to the Tampa affair, the “children  overboard” fabrications, the treatment of asylum seekers, the abandonment of David Hicks in 

 Guantanamo Bay and the experiences of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon.   

 What is a police state?   

 What is a police state? According to the Macquarie Dictionary, it is a country ‘in which the  police, especially the secret police, are employed to detect and suppress any form of  opposition to the government in power.’

 This definition suggests that the key factor is not simply the extent of the powers of  surveillance and repression handed to the police. An essential ingredient is the utilisation of  these powers to suppress political or social opposition.   

 Another well known portrait of a police state is that conjured up by George Orwell in his  famous dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell presented a chilling picture of the  operation of the concepts of ‘doublethink’, ‘thought crimes’, ‘guilt by association’ and ‘Big  Brother is watching’.4   

 My contention is that if Australia is not yet a police state, it is being moved toward one, with  the bipartisan agreement of both traditional ruling parties - Labor and the Liberal-National  Coalition.   

 Over the past six years, dating back to 2000, the year of the Sydney Olympics, several major  steps have been taken. These steps accelerated after the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001 and escalated again last year.   

 In the first half of last year, I wrote an article drawing the obvious parallels between Orwell’s  Nineteen Eighty-Four and the measures adopted in Australia since 2000.5   

 I noted that the developments appeared to be deeply Orwellian in a double sense.    

 In the first place, they resembled the doctrine of ‘doublethink’, which insists that one must  suppress one’s memory of the past in order to embrace a new ‘reality’ - including the  nostrum that ‘everything changed’ with the events of September 11, 2001.    

 Secondly, they embodied the ‘Big Brother is watching’ regime in which ‘Thoughtcrime is  death’.    

 In many ways, much of the language employed in the current ‘war’ is eerily reminiscent of  Winston Smith's explorations of the wonders of doublethink in Nineteen Eighty-Four.   

 One has to suspend all knowledge that today's primary ‘terrorist’ targets -- Al Qaeda-linked  groups -- were yesterday's ‘freedom fighters’ in the guerrilla war against the Soviet-backed  regime in Afghanistan6 and that Saddam Hussein was also once a close ally of Washington,  particularly during the fratricidal Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.7    

 Tonight, however, we are focussing not on the politics of terrorism and its underlying roots,  but rather on the police-state character of the contemporary official response.   

 Life in Orwell’s Oceania was dominated by posters featuring the handsome, moustachioed  face of a dictator. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the captions ran.8 Regular police  patrols, snooping into people's windows, were not the primary threat to freedom of political  thought. Instead, it was the policing of ‘thoughtcrime’ by the Thought Police. Citizens  suspected of harbouring opposing thoughts routinely disappeared without any official  explanation.   

 At first light, it may seem an over-statement to assert that similar processes are under way in  today's political and legal climate. Thankfully, we do not have ubiquitous posters of John

 Howard or other government leaders, figuratively watching our every move. But it is  instructive to review the major shifts that have taken place since 2000.   

 Military call-out legislation 

 In that year, the Sydney Olympic Games provided the immediate rationale for military call-out legislation that overturned the basic political and legal principle—dating back to the  overthrow of the absolute monarchy in Britain in the seventeenth century—against using the  armed forces to suppress civilian disturbances.9 

 Despite producing no evidence of any terrorist threat to the Olympics, the government  mobilised 4,000 troops, including SAS commandos, for the 2000 Games, although it did not  activate the military call-out provisions during the Games.10  

 Nevertheless, the legislation remained on the books, permitting the government to deploy  troops on home soil if it alleged a threat to ‘Commonwealth interests’ or a danger of  ‘domestic violence’ beyond the capacity of a state or territory government. 

 Following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US and the launching of the indefinite  ‘war on terror,’ the government claimed that these requirements were too restrictive.11 In  2003, it commissioned a review by former military, police and public service chiefs to justify  expanding the powers.12    

 Yet, the government waited until late 2005 before bringing forward the new legislation, under  the guise of protecting - this time -- the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. Again, without  claiming any specific terrorist threat to the current Games, the government announced that  2,600 ADF personnel would be deployed for the event.13 The ‘security contingent’ includes  an SAS Tactical Assault Group, Blackhawk helicopters and F/A 18 Hornet jet fighters,  communications units and specialised teams to search venues and operate vehicle 

 checkpoints.   

 In my opinion, the amended laws significantly, and disturbingly, enhanced the government’s  unilateral power to mobilise troops internally in the name of protecting ‘Commonwealth  interests’ and ‘critical infrastructure’ - both terms that are not defined in the amended  Defence Act (Cth) 1903. Military call-outs can now be authorised by a phone call from one or  two ministers or even by the chief of the armed forces, acting on secret government  guidelines.   

 The amendments also gave the military unprecedented domestic powers, including to  interrogate civilians and seize documents, and considerably wider and legally protected rights  to use lethal force, that is, to ‘shoot to kill’. ‘Superior orders’ has become a defence to  criminal and civil liability.   

 Denial of legal rights to asylum seekers   

 After the 2000 military call-out legislation, the next major step in the creation of police state  powers came in late August 2001, when the Australian government deployed SAS troops to

 prevent the asylum seekers rescued by the Norwegian container ship, the MV Tampa, from  landing in a safe harbour at Australia’s Christmas Island. The soldiers detained the rescuees  on the ship’s deck and ultimately transferred them to the HMAS Manoora, a naval troop  carrier, for transportation to far-distant Nauru.    

 The government was aware that it probably lacked any lawful power to do so. It tried to rush  retrospective legislation--the Border Protection Bill 2001--through parliament to authorise its  actions, but the Bill was initially defeated in the Senate. The apparent purpose of the SAS  operation was to evade the Migration Act 1958, which requires government officers to detain  all ‘unlawful’ arrivals. Under the 1999 ‘border protection’ amendments to the Act, military  officers who board refugee vessels, even on the high seas, are obliged to bring the people on  board ashore, to be placed in detention.14   

 On the Federal cabinet's instructions, steps were taken to ensure that the Tampa rescuees  could not contact lawyers to challenge the legality of the government’s conduct or seek their  release from the ship. The government was determined to prevent them from applying for 

 refugee status and protection visas.    

 By the time the case reached the High Court, the government, supported by the Labor Party,  had pushed through parliament a package of legislation retrospectively authorising its conduct  and giving military officers wide-ranging authority to board, search, detain and turn around  refugee boats, using whatever means are considered ‘necessary and reasonable,’ including  force.15    

 These provisions could allow refugees to be brutally treated or their boats to be sunk  deliberately to prevent them landing on Australian soil. This is not far-fetched. Shots were  fired in the direction of at least one over-crowded and sinking boat, whose occupants  government ministers then falsely accused of throwing children overboard.16 Prime Minister  Howard defended the use of capsicum gas and possibly electric prods by Australian military  personnel to force asylum seekers to sail back to Indonesia in an unseaworthy boat that was  later shipwrecked off West Timor.17   

 Other precedents established by the Tampa operation and the ensuing legislation include:   

 * creation of excision zones where Australian migration law does not apply to parts of the  country;    

 * denial of basic legal rights, including the right to seek legal advice, to detainees held in the  excision zones or in Nauru or PNG;    

 * insertion of a sweeping privative clause in the Migration Act to effect a blanket exclusion of  judicial review of nearly all refugee and immigration visa decisions.   

 Even though the latter provision does not seek to override the constitutionally-entrenched  jurisdiction of the High Court, some of these measures may be unconstitutional, including on  the grounds that they block the exercise of Federal judicial power.18

  Even though the High Court has previously upheld the validity of non-judicial detention of asylum seekers. See Chu Kheng  Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 176 CLR 1. 

 

 The High Court later held that the privative clause was ineffective in blocking access to the  High Court.19 However, it also sanctioned the indefinite detention of failed, stateless asylum  seekers, even if for life.20   

 Anti-terrorism laws of 2002-04   

 In the wake of the September 2001 events in the United States, asylum seekers soon proved to  be only the initial targets of such draconian measures.    

 Between 2002 and 2004, the Howard government and the Labor Party opposition combined  to pass more than 30 pieces of so-called counter-terrorism legislation. The full list is on the  federal government’s national security web site.21   

 The laws feature several aspects of Orwell’s predictions.    

 â¢ Secret interrogation and detention without trial: those detained or questioned are  prohibited from informing anyone, even family members, of their disappearance or  the reasons for it.  â¢ Lengthy jail terms for refusing to disclose information (which can include ideas) 

 requested by the security authorities.   â¢ The outlawing of ‘association’ with a member or supporter of a proscribed terrorist  organisation.   â¢ People charged with a ‘terrorist’ offence can be tried semi-secretly, partly on the 

 basis of evidence that they are forbidden to view or hear.   

 The legislation also   

 â¢ defines terrorism in sweeping terms, capable of criminalising many traditional forms  of protest and dissent  â¢ permits the banning of political groups by executive fiat, a power that the High Court  rejected in the 1951 Communist Party case  â¢ shrouds the operations of the intelligence and police agencies in secrecy22   

 None of these measures were necessary to protect ordinary people from terrorism. The  government and the police and security agencies had every power needed to detect, monitor,  arrest and charge terrorists.    

 Every conceivable terrorist act was already a serious crime -- from murder to arson and  hijacking. Furthermore, the criminal law amply covered all planning, preparing, conspiring,  financing, supporting and attempting related to such activities.

 Moreover, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the state and federal  police already possessed immense powers to infiltrate organisations, tap phones, bug  premises, intercept mail, search homes and hack into computers.23   

 Anti-terrorism laws of 2005   

 But last year saw another escalation of police state-style measures.   

 In late 2005 the Australian federal, state and territory governments pushed through their  respective parliaments far-reaching Anti-Terrorism Bills that were agreed upon by Prime  Minister John Howard and the state and territory Labor leaders in their joint communiquÃ©  from the September 27, 2005 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) ‘counter-terrorism’ summit.    

 These measures are self-evidently designed for use where the police and intelligence agencies  cannot produce any evidence of involvement in specific terrorist activity or planning.   

 The Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 1), which was enacted on November 9, 2005, changed the  wording of many terrorist offences from ‘the’ terrorist act to ‘a’ terrorist act. In effect, it  means that people can be convicted of planning or preparing for terrorism and sentenced to  life imprisonment without the police producing any evidence of a specific time, date, location  or method of the supposed attack. The authorities need only establish that the accused’s  conduct related to ‘a’ terrorist act—that is, any potential act.    

 In addition, a person can be convicted even if ‘a terrorist act does not occur’. These  provisions give the police wide powers to arrest people on the vaguest possible charges of, for  example, ‘assisting’, ‘preparing’ or ‘supporting’ an unidentified terrorist act that never takes  place.   

 Above and beyond that, the new laws grant unilateral powers to the federal and state police to  intern ‘suspects’ without any charge or trial whatsoever. This can be done in two ways. First,  anyone whom police allege may be involved in a future terrorist act, or may have information  about such an act, can be seized for ‘preventative detention’ for up to 48 hours by federal  police or 14 days by state police.    

 The grounds for obtaining a preventative detention order are extremely broad and effectively  removes the burden of proof on the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.   

 The Criminal Code Act 1995 s105.4 provides for an ‘issuing authority’ - a judge, former  judge or magistrate operating in a ‘personal capacity’ (i.e., not as a court, but as part of the  executive) -- to grant an order where: 

 (a) there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the subject:   (i) will engage in a terrorist act; or   (ii) possesses a thing that is connected with the preparation for, or the engagement of  a person in, a terrorist act; or   (iii) has done an act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act; and   (b) making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act occurring;  and   (c) detaining the subject for the period for which the person is to be detained under  the order is reasonably necessary for the purpose referred to in paragraph (b).  

 

 23  M Head, ‘Counter-terrorism laws: a threat to political freedom, civil liberties and constitutional rights’ (2002) 26 Melbourne  University Law Review 666. 

 We could spend hours dissecting this section. For now, all we can do is pose some pertinent  questions. What are ‘reasonable grounds’? How can the police predict that someone ‘will  engage in a terrorist act’? Does it mean reading their mind? How can the ‘issuing authority’ 

 conclude that a thing - which could be anything from a mobile phone to a map - is connected  to preparations for a terrorist act? If evidence exists of an act in preparation for, or planning a  terrorist act, why not charge the person and put them on trial? How long is ‘reasonably 

 necessary’?   

 (These questions are all the more pertinent because we know that the power under s 189 of  the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to detain people that an officer ‘reasonably suspects’ of being  an unlawful non-citizen has been used to wrongly detain more than 200 people in  recent years, including Rau and Solon.24)   

 An ‘issuing authority’ can approve the internment in an initial ‘ex parte’ hearing, that is  without the ‘suspect’ being present. Suspects will have limited rights to know why they being  detained. They may be held incommunicado and any conversations they hold with a lawyer 

 can be monitored—removing any semblance of lawyer-client privilege.    

 Anyone—including family members, lawyers and the media—who reveals that the person has  been detained, can be jailed for five years. Parents cannot even tell each other if their son or  daughter is being held. These extraordinary provisions are designed to ensure that no one 

 knows how many people have been rounded up, or why, or in what conditions they are being  held.    

 The Australian Press Council pointed out in its submission to the Senate Legal and  Constitutional Legislation Committee:   

 Even in circumstances where a person has been detained illegally or inappropriately,  the media are unable to investigate or report upon the detention. If detainees have  suffered torture or abuse during their detention, they cannot inform the media of this,  and the media are prohibited from reporting the abuse.25   

 In the second form of detention, specially designated ‘issuing courts’ may grant ‘control  orders’—which can include house arrest, the fitting of personal tracking devices and bans on  employment and all forms of communication—also without any initial notice or hearing. Like  preventative detainees, those under house arrest can be barred from alerting anyone to their  internment. The control orders can last 12 months and be renewed continuously. Detainees  can only challenge them, possibly weeks or months later, in the same special courts.   

 The grounds for granting a control order are equally as vague as for preventative detention,  and lower the burden of proof to the ‘balance of probabilities’. 

 The Criminal Code s 104.4 states that a control order can be granted where: 

 (c) the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities:   (i) that making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act; or   (ii) that the person has provided training to, or received training from, a listed terrorist  organisation; and   (d) the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that each of the obligations,  prohibitions and restrictions to be imposed on the person by the order is reasonably

 necessary, and reasonably appropriate and adapted, for the purpose of protecting the  public from a terrorist act. 

 Again, this wording raises many crucial questions that we cannot probe sufficiently tonight.   

 Preventative detention and control orders can be imposed on top of each other. This is in  addition to the existing provisions, introduced in 2003, for ASIO and the police to secretly  detain a person for seven days for interrogation. The authorities will be able to detain 

 someone for a week of questioning, followed by 14 days of ‘preventative detention’ and a  year or more of house arrest.    

 These laws can allow governments and their security agencies to lock someone away based  solely on what they allege the ‘suspect’ might be intending to do in the future. How different  is this from Orwell’s ‘thoughtcrimes’? Anyone who has seen Minority Report, the movie  starring Tom Cruise, will be familiar with the frightening notion of locking away people  deemed to be thinking of evil-doing.   

 Thus, the legislation clears the way for practices commonly identified with totalitarian  regimes. People can simply ‘disappear’ into police custody, without the media, or anyone  else, being able to report it. Lengthy house arrest can be imposed on political opponents;  secret evidence can be used; and security forces will have explicit ‘shoot-to-kill’ powers.   

 What of the Macquarie Dictionary’s definition that requires such powers to be used to  ‘suppress any form of opposition to the government in power’?   

 I suggest that the essential purpose of the new provisions is precisely to chill political dissent.  In the first place, any organisation that ‘advocates’, ‘praises’ or ‘counsels’ a terrorist act can  be outlawed, automatically exposing its members, supporters and financial donors to  imprisonment as well.    

 ‘Praising’ terrorism could mean merely justifying or expressing sympathy for a hypothetical  terrorist act, or even calling for an understanding of terrorism’s social and economic roots.   

 For example, Kurt Vonnegut, author of the famous novel Slaughterhouse Five26, on the fire-bombing of Dresden by the Allied forces in World War II, in November 2005 described  suicide bombers as ‘very brave’.27 He was not supporting their actions, merely pointing out  that they required courage, and presumably strongly felt causes. Nevertheless, he could be  accused of praising terrorism.   

 Section 102.1(1A)(c) of the Criminal Code goes so far as to proscribe ‘indirectly’  ‘counselling’ or ‘urging’ the doing of a terrorist act. In the words of a March 2006 submission  to an International Commission of Jurists Eminent Jurists Panel, the Gilbert and Tobin Centre  of Public Law:   

 The effect of proscribing an organisation on this basis has serious consequences  under the accompanying criminal provisions. Individuals, be they either a member  (Criminal Code, s 102.3) or an associate (Criminal Code, s 102.8), could be  prosecuted merely because someone in their organisation praised terrorism - even if  the organisation has no other involvement in terrorism; even if the praise did not  result in a terrorist act; and even if the person praising terrorism did not intend to  cause terrorism. This is an extraordinary extension of the power of proscription and

 of criminal liability, since it collectively punishes members of groups for the actions  of their associates beyond their control. Conversely, it is likely to have a ‘chilling’  effect upon free speech.28   

 Moreover, the law of sedition has been radically extended. It now includes ‘urging  disaffection’ against the government, promoting ‘feelings of ill-will or hostility between  different groups’ or urging conduct to assist an ‘organisation or country engaged in armed  hostilities’ against the Australian military, whether or not a state of war has been declared.  Moreover, ‘recklessness’ has been added as a seditious state of mind. That is, anyone can be 

 guilty of sedition even without intending their remarks to create disaffection, ill-will or armed  resistance.29   

 Those convicted will face up to seven years’ jail. Organisations that support such sentiments  can be declared ‘unlawful associations,’ also exposing their property to seizure and their  members, supporters and donors to imprisonment. 

 

 Most notably, these laws allow for the criminalisation of any criticism of the government, or  support for resistance to the growing range of Australian military interventions, including the  occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq or operations in the Asia-Pacific region, such as the  dispatch of troops to the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia or the Philippines.30   

 These sedition offences are currently under review by the Australian Law Reform  Commission.   

 One last element of the Human Rights Commission president John von Doussa’s definition of  a police state was that ‘the conduct of the police cannot be effectively challenged through the  justice system’. Some state Premiers argued that the final version of last year’s Anti-terrorism  Acts provided guarantees of access to judicial review over preventative detention and control  orders.   

 That is misleading. Both types of orders can still be granted ex parte, without the affected  person being present.    

 People placed under control orders can seek review by the court that made the order, but no  time limit is set for the hearing of those applications, and they are only entitled to summaries  of the grounds on which the orders have been made. Decisions by the Attorney-General to  authorise an application for a control order are specifically protected from review under the  ADJR Act.   

 Preventative detention orders are also exempt from the ADJR Act (s 105.51), leaving a  detainee only with the possibly expensive and lengthy option of seeking a writ or other  common law form of review by a superior court. Such a remedy may be practically  impossible to obtain within the 48-hour or 14 day time span of each detention.   

 In any case, in a number of leading cases, the Australian High Court has declined to call into  question decisions made by the security agencies on ‘national security’ grounds.31

 The utilisation of an alleged terrorist threat to overturn traditional civil liberties raises  disturbing historical experiences. It should never be forgotten that Adolf Hitler cited the 1933  Reichstag Fire, which the Nazis falsely attributed to communists, as the reason for insisting  that the parliament agree to rule by decree.32  

 The morning after the fire, Hitler’s cabinet adopted the emergency decree, ‘For the Protection  of the People and State’. In the words of historian Ian Kershaw: 

 With one brief paragraph, the personal liberties enshrined in the Weimar Constitution  - including freedom of speech, of association and of the press, and privacy of postal  and telephone communications - were suspended indefinitely… The hastily  constructed emergency decree amounted to the charter of the Third Reich.33 

 Kershaw records that not only Communists but  

 Social Democrats, trade unionists, and left-wing intellectuals such as Carl Ossietzky  were also among those dragged into improvised prisons, often in the cellars of SA or  SS local headquarters, and savagely beaten, tortured, and in some cases murdered. By  April, the number taken into ‘protective custody’ in Prussia alone was some 25,000.34 

 My conclusion is as follows:   

 Whenever governments and security authorities cite ‘national security’ threats, especially of  indefinite duration, as the justification for suspending or overturning constitutional norms and  basic legal rights, the lessons of history, including in Germany in 1933, suggest a need for  deep distrust. This is not to say that Australia currently faces fascism or military rule, but  measures are being adopted that are beginning to resemble those associated with such  regimes.
