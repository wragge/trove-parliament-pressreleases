 NO MORE EXCUSES FOR LABOR AS BOAT 97 ARRIVES   

 Friday, 26 March 2010    

 In a week where the Rudd Government’s claims of ‘worldwide push factors’ were  dispelled and three more boats have arrived, just who or what will Labor blame  next for their continued failure to act to secure our borders? Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.    

 “The latest boat, with 97 people on board, brings the total number of illegal boat  arrivals for 2010 to 29 boats and almost 1500 people. That is a rate of more  than 10 boats and 530 people per month, more than double the rate last year,”  Mr Morrison said.    

 “The Rudd Government must end the charade being played out on Christmas  Island and come clean on when they will now transfer people to the mainland  and implement their preferred policy to abandon universal off shore processing,”  he said.    

 “United Nations figures demonstrate that Australia is bucking the global trend on  asylum applications, exposing Labor’s spin about global push factors being  responsible for their own policy failures.    

 “The arrival of boat 97 though puts the argument to rest, with the people  smugglers reminding everyone about what is really happening and who is in  charge.    

 “The Rudd Government has brought this problem upon themselves by rolling  back the strong border protection regime they inherited. They need to overcome  their denial and accept their responsibility.    

 “But it is not just their weak policies that have done the damage, it is their weak  decisions as well.    

 “Reports today indicate that even the United Nations has expressed concern  about the Rudd Government’s ‘bad practice’ on border protection, with their  special deal for the passengers on the Oceanic Viking contributing to the pull  factors and making a bad situation worse.    

 “More than half the boats that have arrived on Kevin Rudd’s watch have turned  up since the PM blinked and gave a special deal to the passengers on the  Oceanic Viking to expedite their claims,” Mr Morrison said.    

 Mr Keenan said: “Despite Labor’s attempts to spin this latest arrival, there is no  denying that Border Protection Command is stretched to its limit as it faces the  challenge of intercepting what has become a boat a day.    

 “The Government needs to come clean about the extent to which Australia’s  borders are being breached, and stop hiding behind the usual Labor spin.  

 

 “It’s hard not to notice the fact that this latest boat arrived yesterday evening,  yet it took the Government almost 24 hours to announce it, and outside of the  media’s deadlines to avoid scrutiny.    

 “This is typical nonsense by the Labor Government, hiding from the issue rather  than facing up to the Australian people,” Mr Keenan said.
