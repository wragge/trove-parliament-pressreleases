 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 11 April 2013   

 Opposition and Katter need to know; we are not  at war with refugees   

 The political war on refugees means that the level of hysteria surrounding the debate is now  completely out of control, the Australian Greens said today.   

 “Using the rhetoric of war against refugees is hysterical and it is pushing the debate around people  who seek asylum in Australia to a worrying low that we have never seen before,” the Greens  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Bob Katter’s plan for 100 missile laden patrol boats cruising around our borders warding off leaky  refugee boats is absolute insanity and it doesn’t warrant further consideration.   

 “The Opposition’s plan to tow back boats when they are acting lawfully in international waters has  been labelled as potential piracy by a former Defence Force Chief.   

 “These aren’t effective or even rational responses to people in our region needing protection.   

 “These are desperate men, women and children fleeing war, they need our help and protection not  our missiles and guns.   

 “Currently these ideas are a national embarrassment but if Tony Abbott gets his way and can turn  his outlandish plans into government policy, it will become extremely dangerous.   

 “Someone needs to tell Tony Abbott, Scott Morrison and Bob Katter that there is no war on  refugees.”
