 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Sunday, 25th November 

 Deadly consequences of immigration reality    

 As we hear news of another refugee boat tragedy, it is clearly time to change the tenor of debate  over immigration policy in our country the Australian Greens said today.   

 "It's time for Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott to stop using refugees in their ugly political fight and  trading sound bites for these vulnerable people's lives," the Greensâ€™ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 "Both of the parties have engaged in this despicable race to the bottom and it is really sad to see this  crisis of cruelty being passed off as legitimate policy.    

 "It is simply not right and there are many conscientious and caring Australians who are disappointed  to see the Government acting in this cruel way that goes against what we stand for as a country.    

 "The Government has proudly announced the forced return of many people, who haven't even had  their claims assessed, to Sri Lanka and I have consistently been calling for a system of oversight from  the Australian Government to ensure they don't suffer at the hands of the oppressive regime to  which we are sending them.    

 "We have seen the auctioning off of refugee rights, where the political leader with the lowest bid is  pretending to be the winner, but Australians won't be fooled.    

 "This is real bottom of the barrel stuff and it has to end."
