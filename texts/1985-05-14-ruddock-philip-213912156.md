 PRESS STATEMENT BY PHILIP RUDDOCK SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 "REFUGEE REDUCTION"

 Opposition Spokesman for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, 

 Philip Ruddock said that the Government's motives on 

 moves to reduce the refugee intake were now quite obvious.

 "The need to pursue non settlement solutions to the 

 refugee problem no longer appears the real reason 

 for reducing the Indo-Chinese Refugee Program while 

 increasing family re-union from Vietnam.

 "A more compelling and perhaps the real and underlying 

 reason for the change in policy has been revealed in 

 the Treasurer's statement tonight. -  â

 "The reduction of assisted passenger places by 2,000 

 with a saving of $3.6 million is one Of the more obvious 

 reasons for the Minister's visit to Indo China and his 

 ambiguous statements.

 "We now know the price of the Labor's Government1s 

 moral commitment to bur refugee obligations and to the 

 region. -
