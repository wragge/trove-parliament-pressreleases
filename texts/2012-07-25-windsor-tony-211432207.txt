 TONY WINDSOR B.Ec MP  INDEPENDENT   FEDERAL MEMBER FOR NEW ENGLAND   

 PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES   

 Media Release     25th July 2012   Statement on Navy briefing to Refugee Working Group from Tony Windsor MP   Media references to the Navy’s briefing to the Cross Party Working Group on Refugees are incorrect.  Vice Admiral Griggs made it very clear that the Navy does not take positions on policy and that the Navy’s responsibility was to safely and lawfully execute the direction of Government.  The Working Group also made it very clear to Vice Admiral Griggs that the Working Group very much appreciated the work being done by the Navy and the way it was being undertaken on behalf of the Australian people.  The men and women in the Navy have a very tough job to do in dangerous life threatening situations and we should all be very grateful for their contribution to our country.
