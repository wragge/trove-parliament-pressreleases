 AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRAT SPEECHES

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja Portfolio: General

 National Launch of the Australian Democrats Federal Election campaign

 Thank you friends, Democrats one and all. Thank you Aden for your lovely introduction. I too wish to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of this land, the Kuarna people.

 I take this opportunity to restate the Australian Democrats’ commitment to reconciliation and to a treaty with Australia’s indigenous people.

 In fact, this year’s Yeperenye Festival, in the Northern Territory, the Indigenous Peoples of Australia welcomed all Australians to this land in a gesture of reconciliation. It was part of the Centenary of Federation events, but also, a landmark of significance in its own right, in our journey as a nation.

 It stands as an example of good will and cooperation among peoples, and it stands in stark contrast to some recent events that we have witnessed on the international and domestic scale in this country.

 One hundred years ago, Federation was an important step in our journey as a democratic and united nation.

 Reconciliation, and an Australian Republic with an Australian head of state, these will also be significant milestones because in this country we still have some unfinished business.

 Today, Democrats, I am excited, and honored, to a part of this launch, to be assisting with the National Launch of the Australian Democrats campaign for the 2001 Federal election.

 As you’ve heard, from Matthew and others, we are running Senate candidates in every state and territory. And House of Representatives candidates -150 candidates.

 We are committed to giving people the opportunity to vote Democrat everywhere.

 From Mayo to Solomon, from Kalgoorlie to Cunningham, and from Sydney to Boothby.

 Every voter has been given a real choice this Federal election campaign, just like the voters in the ACT yesterday.

 Every one of more than 12 and a half million voters around this country has the chance to vote Democrat.

 We might finally have the momentum to break that lower house barrier. And you know what, if it’s going to happen, it will probably going to happen here first, in our heartland of South Australia.

 Because you know what, there is a spot just at the back of the House of Representatives, a little on the left hand side, that looks just right for the Australian Democrats.

 It is even conceivable that - one day - the Democrats could hold the balance of power, not only in the Upper House but in the Lower House as well, and you know what, that would really change politics.

 It’s true that Australia is facing the challenges of rapid change and we are trying to find our role in global events. At the same time that this is happening, we have a crisis of faith in our politicians and in politics and political institutions.

 It’s clear: the Australian public is turning away from the ‘two dogs barking’, style of Australian politics.

 So the important choice facing voters at this Federal election campaign is not just which Party will be in Government, but who will hold the balance of power - will it be a grab bag of minor parties and independents, or Pauline Hanson’s One Nation or … will it be the Australian Democrats.

 When Australians vote on November 10, they are choosing, not only a Government, but who will watch over that Government.

 Now the Democrats are well known for our traditional role in the Senate, providing a check on Executive power and encouraging transparency and accountability in Government dealings.

 The question facing voters is not just will the Coalition keep Government, but who will keep Government honest?

 Now, 5 out of 9 Democrat senators, including me, in the state of South Australia, five out of nine are up for re-election in this campaign. In many respects, this is our toughest election ever.

 How the Democrats poll, will determine if Pauline Hanson’s One Nation shares the balance of power role. Think about it.

 If One Nation gains more seats in Parliament, it would have a huge impact on Australian public policy.

 Most Australians don’t want the Senate to be either a rubber stamp or obstructionist. They want expert legislators, and that’s what they’ve got with the team that you see before you.

 The Democrats are a sensible, balancing force between Government and Opposition when they bicker, and we provide an alternative voice on the many, many occasions when the two old parties vote together.

 For the last 24 years, the Democrats, have negotiated to ensure the fairest laws for all Australians. And we want to continue to do so, and we deserve, based on our record, the opportunity to do just that.

 Australia deserves representation from a party that is focused on, as Aden said, the triple bottom line: environmental protection, social justice, and economic sustainability.

 The Democrats are not a B-grade version of either of the old parties. We pursue practical, positive solutions and we’re prepared to negotiate to bring them about. This is what Change Politics is about: good ideas and positive outcomes, not just scare tactics and insults.

 We are different, not just in our policies but the way we practice politics.

 We’re member led, we’re member driven. Policies, pre-selection, even the election of Leader is decided by a democratic ballot, not in a backroom. And this is a message, a very strong message to the public today, the members keep us honest.

 I take this opportunity to thank the members for the work that you’ve been doing, and for the hard work you are about to do, over the next 20 days.

 On the first fortnight of the campaign, we have hit the ground running.

 We have encouraged young people vote, encouraging them to enrol to vote, through our 1st time voter’s kit, through our youth poll launch, and through the promotion, as Aden pointed out, of younger candidates as well. But we are appealing to all ages, and all voters.

 We have spelt out many of our commitments to the Australian people in recent weeks, such as on; endangered species; threatened species; on balancing work and family life; no tax on books; on an efficient transport system; minimising the tax burden on small business; supporting small business; emphasising how important innovation, education, and the arts are to our community. We’ve argued for a fair go for rural and regional communities. And only the day before yesterday, we launched our commitment to a strong, well-resourced, independent ABC.

 Tomorrow, we release an employment policy that will actually create jobs, and many other commitments are due to be unveiled over the coming weeks to the Australian people.

 They say a week is a long time in politics. But over the next three weeks, Australians, along with the Democrats, have a chance to change politics.

 Health, education, environment, these are the issues that Australians care about. They’re telling us.

 Many Australians are Democrats - they just don’t know it yet.

 Now whether you think the Coalition and the Labor party sound like two dogs barking or the just look a little like the two Ronnie’s, we know something and that is they are just too alike.

 Well I think Australians want more from their elected representatives.

 They want honesty. They want a vision of where Australia could be in at least 30, 40 years, not just after the next election campaign.

 We can build a vision for Australia’s future and work together as a nation to achieve it.

 We have made these commitments to the Australian people, and I am going to go through a few. I want to reiterate them today.

 Firstly, we will not support tax cuts for the rich while the poorest are neglected and we will not support any attempts to increase the rate of the Goods and Services Tax.

 We believe it’s possible to pull people out of poverty, to create jobs and we can care for older Australians.

 The Democrats have made a commitment to help Australians balance work and family life.

 We know that there are more than two and a half million Australians who are now working more than 45 hours a week. At the same time, one in five children in this country are being raised in households where neither parent has a full time job.

 We need to have a community conversation about how to spread the work around and how we do that in a fair way. Well, the Australian Democrats Fair Hours Fund and a maternity leave payment will tackle the twin issues of overwork and underemployment, as well as address the increasing pressure on families.

 And, as I mentioned, the day before yesterday, along with Senator Vicki Bourne, in Sydney, the Democrats committed to an independent and well resourced ABC because we recognise its value.

 The Australian Democrats are also committed to providing all Australians access to high quality, publicly funded, accessible to all, education. Because we know that Australia’s investment in higher education currently, and at all other levels; pre-school, primary, secondary, vocational etc, is not adequate for a country that aspires to have a significant role in the global knowledge economy.

 Unlike nearly all OECD countries, our investment in higher education, and research specifically, is declining as a percentage of GDP. We believe education is an investment, not a cost and the Democrats reiterate our commitment to education for all, universal access and it must be publicly funded.

 We have witnessed the degradation of public schools in this country, in our TAFEs and universities.

 Australia is one of the few OECD countries in the world where school retention rates are actually declining. Now, in a world that we know is increasingly dependent on highly skilled, adaptable learners, why are our school retention rates going in the wrong direction?

 We are also committed to supporting small business. We know that the small business sector is not simply an economic statistic, but it is a crucial element in Australia’s cohesion, employment creation and, of course, for our communities, particularly regional.

 We will campaign for reduced red tape, for fairer competition and for better workplace relations in small business.

 The Democrats have a proud record in addressing the disadvantage suffered by our regional and rural and remote communities, particularly the brutal changes as a consequence of deregulation.

 We’re committed to fair farm gate prices, no further privatisation of Telstra, and the end of National Competition Policy reforms.

 The old parties have voted together to sell our public assets. The Democrats are here it say it again, we will continue to oppose the further privatisation of Telstra. That’s a promise.

 Now, much has been made of the need to leave future generations debt free, but what about leaving them an inheritance? What about a heritage of good education, good health care, a social infrastructure and a clean environment. These are the endowments future generations need.

 Now, we’ve always been ‘years ahead’ as Democrats, in regard to the protection of our environment, and in respect to human rights and will continue to be.

 We’ve also led the field in terms of accountability and honesty in Government. You know, it was ten years ago now that the Democrats forced a public register of political donations to be kept.

 Today, we’re offering a commonsense, compassionate approach to Australian politics, as well as Good Economic Management.

 If we invest in education and our environment now, the long term returns are priceless, we know that.

 For 24 years, the Democrats have been offering a third way. But for a new generation of young people there has never been a time when the Democrats were not in the Parliament. We actually have our first generation of born and bred true believers.

 In this campaign, the Democrats are providing a voice for many Australians. Those Australians who want more resources for public schools and for public hospitals; those Australian’s who want our unique and fragile natural environment protected; those Australians who want a compassionate approach to refugees and the most disadvantaged Australians.

 Next year we celebrate a quarter of a century.

 Over almost twenty five years, our principles have remained the same.

 Standing for environmental sanity, economic responsibility, equality, industrial democracy, reconciliation, social justice, a strong ABC, a well resourced public sector, free, accessible education. But also standing for a new type of politics where backroom deals and petty insults don't dominate.

 Now, we heard from Don Chipp, earlier, the most famous of our founders.

 At the 1977 Federal election campaign, the Democrats offered a credible alternative.

 To paraphrase Don, and it is occasionally hard to do that, he said ‘we stood for a credible alternative to cynicism, character assassination, misleading statistics, name-calling, pork-barrelling, union bashing, confrontation, dirty tricks, secrecy and despair’.

 The Democrats stood for then, and still stand for, hope, reconciliation, optimism, openness, honesty, tolerance and compassion.

 The Democrats have changed the political dynamic of this country. We’ve shown you can change the world, give a damn, get a future, keep the bastards honest, and, now, Change Politics.

 It is said politics is often the art of the possible. But the Democrats, on occasions, have achieved what has seemed impossible.

 More than 20 years ago, Don Chipp's posed this question: "When you decide on a party you'll support, you're not really thinking about yourself... are you? Subconsciously, you are in fact thinking about your children and your grandchildren. You know that somehow or other, you and I will survive the 80s, but what kind of Australia are we going to present to our kids?"

 Well, fellow Democrats, we have that answer now - it's a lot better than it would have been if the Democrats had not ventured onto the political landscape and built our own foundations.

 So, today, I’m asking you to keep asking, "What kind of Australia are we going to present to our kids over

 the next 20, 25 years and beyond?”

 Just over a hundred years ago, now, on the South Australian ballot paper for Federation, these words were written:

 “The strength of democracy is that every man and woman whose names are on the roll exercise a vote as powerful as the highest in the land.”

 That is what we are asking the Australian public to do on November 10. On November 10, Australians have the power to help the Australian Democrats to Change Politics.
