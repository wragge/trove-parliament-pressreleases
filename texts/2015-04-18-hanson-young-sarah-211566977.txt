 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Saturday, 18 April 2015   

 Abbott government must lift veil of secrecy on Operation Secret Boats    

 The Australian Greens are today calling on the Abbott government to lift the veil of secrecy and be  up front with the Australian people about what is happening to the 50 Vietnamese asylum seekers  currently detained on an Australian Navy vessel.    

 “I am extremely concerned for the 50 asylum seekers who are currently being shipped back to their  homeland by the Australian Navy,” Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Australia has a proud history of welcoming Vietnamese refugees and giving them a place to call  home. Tony Abbott is trashing our legacy of compassion and empathy.    

 “This is the exact opposite of what Malcolm Fraser would have done.    

 “Rather than extending a welcoming hand as Mr Fraser did, Tony Abbott is just turning his back on  those who have asked for help.   

 “The Abbott government needs to pull back the cloak of secrecy and explain to the Australian people  what is happening out on the high seas.     

 “Those on board the boat deserve to have their claims for protection processed fairly here in  Australia.    

 “Without assessing their claims for asylum properly we risk returning them to imminent danger.
