 Australia helps refugees rebuild their lives

 More than 13 000 people who have fled war, persecution or political strife in their  troubled homelands began new lives in Australia last year, the Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today. 

 The 13 014 humanitarian visas granted in 2007-08 shows our commitment to helping  some of the world’s most needy people rebuild their lives in Australia,’ Senator  Evans said. 

 Burmese people who had been living in camps on the Thai-Burma border and in  Malaysia and India were among the major groups assisted last year. 

 

 Senator Evans listens to a Karen refugee tell his life story as part of the Australian Cultural Orientation  program. In the background are Australian Youth Ambassadors Darcy Lyons, left, and Claire Wilson. 

 During his trip to south-east Asia last week, Senator Evans visited a refugee camp  on the Thai-Burmese border about 450km north-west of Bangkok to see first-hand  the plight of some of the Burmese refugees who had fled to Thailand. 

 ‘There are more than 40 000 people in the Mae La refugee camp, mostly people of  Karen ethnicity who faced persecution by the Burmese military junta,’ Senator Evans  said. 

 ‘It was distressing to see so many people living in makeshift housing because it is  unsafe to live in their own homes in Burma. 

 'As a father, it was particularly upsetting to see children growing up in a refugee  camp far from their homeland - without many of the things that most of us take for  granted.’ 

 The Mae La camp started in 1984 as a small settlement for ethnic Karen fleeing  violence in Burma. It has grown to be the largest of the nine refugee camps in the  region. More than 9000 people from the camp have been resettled since then and a  further 10 000 are expected to leave during 2008.  

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates there are  currently about 116 000 registered Burmese refugees and about 3700 unregistered  refugees in nine camps along the Thai-Burma border.

 In 2007-08, Australia granted 2961 humanitarian visas to Burmese refugees. It is  expected Burmese will continue to be one of the largest groups of entrants under  Australia’s humanitarian program for 2008-09.

 Senator Evans said 2215 Iraqis were the second largest group in Australia’s 2007-08  humanitarian program, which also included 1185 refugees from Afghanistan, 1158  from Sudan, 410 from Liberia, 348 from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 303 from  Burundi, 302 from Iran and 267 from Sierra Leone.  

 Refugees from the Middle-East and south west Asia made up 35 per cent of the  program, people from the rest of Asia 34 per cent and people from Africa 30 per  cent. 

 Almost 83 per cent of visas were granted to people applying overseas while 1900  initial protection visas were granted onshore. 

 Senator Evans said 13.7 per cent of refugee visas were granted in the “woman at  risk” category, well ahead of the program’s 10.5 per cent target. 

 The minister said the 2007-08 humanitarian program ensured Australia remained  among the world’s top three refugee resettlement countries along with the United  States and Canada. 

 Senator Evans said Australia’s commitment to refugee resettlement was  complemented by the Government’s assistance to people suffering from long-term  displacement. 

 

 As part of the Australian Cultural Orientation program, refugee children play dress-up games. A young  refugee boy dresses in a Victoria Police cap and shirt as part of a lesson for children that they can  trust police in Australia and should not feel scared about contacting them. 

 The Rudd Government recently approved $6.45 million for international aid projects  to assist displaced persons in Thailand, Iraq, Syria, Nepal, Bangladesh, Africa and  Pakistan. 

 More than $2.5 million of the funding will go to UNICEF and Austcare for projects  aimed at addressing the situation of displaced people from Burma in Thailand.  UNICEF will receive nearly $1 million to strengthen child protection services for  children living in the camps.  

 

 The minister presents a gift to Karen lady at the International Organizattion for Migration Refugee  Transit Centre, Mae Pa, in Tak Province. She will be resettled in Australia this month.
