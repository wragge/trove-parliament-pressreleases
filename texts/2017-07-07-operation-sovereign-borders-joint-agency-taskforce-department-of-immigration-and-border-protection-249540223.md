 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the on-water



 reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



 The reporting period is from 1 June 2017 to 30 June 2017.



 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration authorities.



 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres.



 During this same period, the Australian Government worked with the Government of Sri Lanka to return six people



 who did not engage Australia's protection obligations



 One illegal maritime arrival detainee was voluntarily removed from Australia. Five illegal maritime arrival detainees



 were involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin or a third country. Their removal from Australia is



 consistent with Australia's obligations.



 Five illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



 country.



 As at 30 June 2017, there was a total of 803 people in Manus Island RPC and 371 people in Nauru RPC. With the



 opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on those



 still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



 Of the 1025 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 515 were positive and 510 were



 negative as at 30 June 2017. There were 729 refugees who have been given a positive final determination. There



 were 252 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



 Of the 1210 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 1052 were positive and 158 were negative



 as at 30 June 2017.
