 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 20 June 2001  MEDIA RELEASE                          01/360

 Reception centres not detention centres The Australian Democrats welcomed the unanimous resolution of a bipartisan parliamentary human rights committee on refugees, but were puzzled by the hostile response from Minister Ruddock.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, Australian Democrats Spokesperson for Immigration, said, “It’s timely that this report was launched this week, as today is the United Nations Refugee Day - a day to be celebrated throughout the world, but not in Australia.

 “It was particularly disappointing to read comments in one newspaper suggesting that asylum seekers should be sent back to die.  The Howard Government through its demonising of refugees and asylum seekers has only succeeded in inciting the community’s and the media’s vilification of asylum seekers.

 “Australia hangs its head in shame - there is no cause for celebration.”

 Senator Bartlett continued, “No Australian visiting these centres in good conscience could remain unmoved by the harsh realities faced by Australia’s asylum seekers on a daily basis. Australia needs to provide reception centres not detention centres for those people fleeing privation and persecution in their homeland.

 “Of those asylum seekers currently in detention centres, only those following the most rigorous of evaluations, will be determined to be genuine refugees and granted temporary protection visas. More than 80 per cent of detainees qualify as refugees.

 “Many of these same refugees will go on to become permanent Australian residents and taxpayers - this is the reality!”

 “Reports highlighting de-humanising and de-moralising practices such as identifying people by ID numbers and conducting mandatory roll calls, during the night, do nothing to improve our record.

 “These practices resemble a concentration camp and are clearly in contravention of the United Nation’s High Commission for Human Rights, for which we have been strongly criticised by the UN.

 “With Australia’s record on asylum seekers now in the spotlight, it is an ideal time for the Government to finally heed the Democrats’ calls for the application of an appropriate accountability framework for immigration detainees.

 “The Australian Democrats are also calling for an independent watchdog to permanently oversee conditions within centres. United Nations Refugee Day should be a day we can celebrate, not one where we skulk in shadows,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
