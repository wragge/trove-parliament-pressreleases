 Ruddock’s Friend Kisrwani Twice as Successful as  Refugee Review Tribunal   

 

 The Senate inquiry into Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters  commenced today in Canberra.     

 The Department provided the damning information that in the two years  2000-2002 the Refugee Review Tribunal referred 229 cases to the Minister  that raised humanitarian considerations.     

 Of these cases, the Minister granted only 42 visas (or 18%).    

 Yet we know that Mr Ruddock’s friend and Liberal Party fundraiser, Mr  Kisrwani, has a success rate of 50%.   

 

 â¢ Ruddock 7.30 Report - 3 July 2003 - "rejected on as many  occasions as successful"  â¢ Ruddock SBS Insight 28 August 2003 "19 granted, 19 refusals"     

 

 We are entitled to ask why a travel agent, who is not even registered as a migration  agent, has more influence with the Minister than the Government’s own expert review  tribunal.   

 

 NOTE - Ms Roxon will be holding a doorstop at 3pm today in the   Opposition Leader’s Courtyard.   

 For further information contact Matt Nurse on 0417 386 535  or Chris Black on 0409 776 733
