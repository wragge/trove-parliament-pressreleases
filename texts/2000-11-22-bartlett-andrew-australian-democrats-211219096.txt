 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 22 Nov 2000 Press Release Number: 00/712 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Children should not be in detention: Democrats oppose mandatory detention The investigation into allegations of abuse of a young boy at Woomera detention centre should be broadened to consider whether children should be kept in detention, according to the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett.

 The Democrats oppose mandatory detention for unauthorised arrivals.

 “There needs to be more flexibility in the system. Children and families who have not been convicted of any crime should not be subject to automatic, indefinite detention,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “There are hundreds of children locked away behind wire fences throughout Australia.

 “Some children are born and raised in detention centres while their parents wait for the Government to decide if they can stay,” he said.

 “Australia is one of the few countries in the world which compulsorily detains all unauthorised arrivals indefinitely. This policy was introduced by the ALP and has been supported by both larger parties since that time.

 “Asylum seekers in detention centres have fewer legal rights than anyone else in Australia, including people in Australia's gaols. They are not automatically entitled to legal assistance or even to visitors or contact with the outside world. They have no idea when they might be released and are frequently unable to contact even their immediate family,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Australia's insistence on locking up all unauthorised arrivals for prolonged periods of time is causing immense and unnecessary suffering, often to people who have already endured an enormous amount escaping persecution,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The allegations of child abuse at Woomera detention centre are just the latest in a line of complaints and concerns expressed about the impact of Australia's detention regime.

 “Church and welfare agencies which care for people when they are eventually released frequently report stories of trauma suffered whilst inside the centres.

 “Both larger political parties are still supportive of locking children up,” said Senator Bartlett.

 Senator Bartlett said the Government was responsible for the conditions at the detention centres and could not hide behind commercial arrangements with Australasian Correctional Management which is contracted to run the centres.
