 NSW Community Resilience projects receive $1.55 million funding boost 

 Acting Minister for Justice Peter Dutton and New South Wales Minister for Justice and  Police Troy Grant, today announced $1.55 million in grant funding for 13 Community  Resilience Innovation Program projects.  

 Minister Dutton said funding for these projects is provided under the joint Commonwealth-State 2015-17 National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience, which aims to  make communities more resilient to natural disasters. 

 “But we cannot do this alone. That is why we are committed to working with local  government councils and the community to strengthen our preparedness, resilience and  recovery from natural disasters,” Mr Dutton said.  

 “This funding directly supports collaboration between local community organisations and  emergency service agencies to build community capacity and keep NSW communities safe.”  

 Minister Grant said while parts of NSW are still affected by flood waters, the bush fire season  is now upon us.  

 “We must be prepared to act swiftly when natural disasters strike and I encourage all NSW  communities to have a plan for their homes and their families in place,” Mr Grant said.  

 “Each of the projects announced today are great examples of the way communities work  together to assist our most vulnerable prepare for natural disasters, with community  organisations, local councils and emergency services agencies among the recipients.”
