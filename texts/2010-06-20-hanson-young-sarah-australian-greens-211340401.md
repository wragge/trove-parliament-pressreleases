 Statement for World Refugee Day 

 Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young  

 Sunday 20th June 2010, 9:30am 

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens Spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights: 

 

 "As we celebrate World Refugee Day today, it's important that the Federal Government acknowledges the 

 real effect of its asylum-seeker policies. 

 

 "We need to see an end to using vulnerable asylum-seekers as political footballs. 

 

 "The first thing the Government has to do to redeem itself is to lift its suspension of processing claims from 

 Sri Lankans and Afghanis. 

 

 "We know the damage that can be done to people's mental health when they are detained for prolonged 

 periods. 

 

 "If the suspension is not lifted, then we are going to see more men, women and children suffering harm 

 through their detention. 

 

 "The Government needs to stop trying to project a false image of toughness on asylum-seekers, and 

 remove policies that discriminate against people fleeing persecution because of their country of origin or 

 their mode of arrival in Australia.''
