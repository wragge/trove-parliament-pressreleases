 Asylum seeker detained for over 5 years so far 

 

 Today marks the start of the sixth year for an Iranian asylum seeker in  detention, according to Democrats Leader and Immigration spokesperson,  Senator Andrew Bartlett, who has met with the detainee at the Baxter detention 

 centre.    

 His name should not be used for fear of reprisals to family members back in  Iran. He is now the second person who has been in detention in Australia for  over five years.    

 Senator Bartlett said keeping people who have committed no crime in detention  for such extreme lengths of time is immensely cruel and totally unjustified.    

 "The election result will not deter the Democrats from continuing to fight for  justice for refugees.    

 "There are still thousands of people suffering as a direct result of Government  laws and policy and the Democrats will not let their plight be forgotten," Senator  Bartlett said.    

 Recently the Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, has  reopened cases of long term detained people such as the Afghans, Iraqis and  Christian Iranians. However there are many more social groups who need to be  reassessed in light of the duration of their detention. Political refugees from Iran  is one such group.    

 "There are many cases of people seeking asylum for political persecution in Iran  and these people have been detained in some cases for over 5 years. Clearly if  they had an option to return home in safety they would have taken it by now," 

 Senator Bartlett said.  

 

 "There has been no significant positive change in the political system in Iran, so  waiting another 5 years before reassessing the cases is not only cruel, but also  a stupid waste of taxpayer funds as these people are not going anywhere."
