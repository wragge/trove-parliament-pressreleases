 Australia provides more aid for Cambodian returnees

 Australia will provide $2.7 million for the latest phase of repatriation and reintegration of Cambodians from border camps in Thailand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans announced today.

 "Since 1988 Australia has provided more than $20 million for a comprehensive range of repatriation programs for Cambodian refugees," Senator Evans said.

 "The repatriation of Cambodians is one of the largest operations ever undertaken by the United Nations and other international aid agencies.

 "An estimated 281,000 of the 360,000 refugees have returned to Cambodia.

 "Five border camps have already closed and two others are expected to close by April.

 "The latest aid package emphasises Australia's support for the work of the United Nations and other agencies in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Cambodia."

 Australia will provide $1.6 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) for the purchase, shipment and distribution of 2,000 tonnes of Australian rice. The rice will be used in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

 program to provide a food supply to returnees for 400 days after their return.

 A further $600,000 will be provided to the UNHCR for completion of the repatriation of all refugees from Thailand and $500,000 will be provided in support of the activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross. These activities include prosthetics construction, tracing and re-uniting families, operation of the only secure blood bank in Cambodia, and some monitoring and protection activities.

 Assistance for the repatriation and reintegration of Cambodian refugees is being provided through AIDAB, Australia's overseas aid agency.
