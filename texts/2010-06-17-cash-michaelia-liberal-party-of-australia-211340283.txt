 Rudd Labor Can’t Protect Our Borders     17 June 2010    

 

 Our borders are in crisis because Rudd Labor can’t protect them.   

 “Kevin Rudd’s border protection procedures are yet another example of his failed policies. Rudd  Labor  just  can’t  get  it  right,  with  everything  from  the  proposed  mining  supertax  to  border   protection,” says Michaelia Cash, Senator for Western Australia.   

 People  are  entering  our  country  illegally  in  unprecedented  numbers.  137  boats  have  arrived   illegally in Australia since Kevin Rudd took office. 3 boats, on average, illegally enter our country  per week under Rudd Labor.    

 Christmas  Island  is  full.  It  now  has  almost  2,500  people  in  detention  or  in  related  facilities.  In   contrast, a mere 6 people were detained on Christmas Island on 30 July 2008 just prior to Rudd  Labor's  rollback  of  the  Coalition's  strong  border  protection  regime.  The  Government  spends  an  outrageous amount to ferry asylum seekers and Government staff to and from Christmas Island -  almost $200,000 per week.   

 Rudd  Labor  has  now  started  to  detain  illegal  immigrants  in  the  Curtin  detention  facility  on  the   Australian  mainland.  “However,”  asks  Senator  Cash,  “what  happens  when  the  Curtin  detention   facility fills past capacity? Where will Rudd place the asylum seekers then? Will he use detention  centres nationwide? Will you see a detention centre in your neighbourhood?”   

 The  Coalition  proposes  several  policies  to  lower  the  number  of  illegal  immigrants  entering   Australia.  For  example,  the  Coalition  proposes  to  establish  an  off  shore  processing  detention   facility in another country. People seeking to enter Australia by boat will travel to the new facility,  instead of Australia.
