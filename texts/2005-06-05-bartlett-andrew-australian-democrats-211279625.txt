 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/300 SUNDAY 5 JUNE 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT                DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS                           DEMOCRATS CALL ON VANSTONE TO HALT DEPORTATIONS TO CHINA The Australian Democrats have called on the Immigration Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, to halt all forced deportation to China until allegations made by a defecting Chinese diplomat have been properly examined. Democrats’ Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said allegations by asylum seeker Chen Younglin that China was kidnapping its citizens from Australia back to China and raising concerns about China’s treatment of dissidents, needed to be properly examined. “There are currently a number of Chinese citizens in Villawood detention centre facing possible deportation.  None of these people should be subjected to forced removal until all of the allegations made by Mr Younglin have been properly investigated,” Senator Bartlett said. “In the six months to the end of March this year, around 465 people from China lodged asylum applications in Australia.  We should use the opportunity to attempt to get a clearer insight into some of the real risks that asylum seekers face if they are returned to China. “Diplomatic sensitivities and desires for a Free Trade Agreement should not be allowed to get in the way of a proper examination of serious human rights allegations.” “China is still regularly accused of very serious human rights abuses, and we cannot keep turning our eyes away from that fact just because it is inconvenient.  China may be moving towards a market economy, but it is still run by an authoritarian communist dictatorship. “This claim for asylum by someone who reportedly has four years experience working in the Chinese Consulate in Sydney gives Australia a good opportunity to get inside information about the reality of how China treats its dissidents today.” “Senator Vanstone would recall her previous experience as acting Immigration Minster in 1997 when she authorised the deportation of a Chinese woman who was subsequently subjected to a forced abortion when she was over eight month’s pregnant. “That awful experience should remind her that she cannot just rely on assurances from her officials or from the Chinese Government in assessing what may happen to Chinese asylum seekers.” Media contact - Senator Andrew Bartlett - 0418 743 789
