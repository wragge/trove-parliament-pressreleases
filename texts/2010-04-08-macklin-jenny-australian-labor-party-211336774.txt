 Media Release 

 $80 million to help Australians with a mental illness 

 08/04/2010 

 Australians with a severe mental illness will continue to have access to  intensive, one-on-one support through an $80.3 million over three years  funding extension to the Personal Helpers and Mentors (PHaMs) program. 

 Through this funding, 33 providers offering services at 58 locations across  Australia will be able to continue to employ 290 full-time equivalent personal  helpers and mentors to work individually with people with mental illnesses. 

 Since 2007 PHaMs services have helped around 9,000 people with a  mental illness. 

 PHaMs is designed to help people with a severe mental illness reconnect  with the wider community and live more independent and satisfying lives. 

 Working one-on-one with participants, personal helpers and mentors  provide practical help with setting and achieving personal goals, such as  finding suitable housing, using public transport or improving relationships  with family and friends. 

 By building their confidence and increasing their connections within the  community, personal helpers and mentors help participants overcome the  social isolation that can be so crippling for someone with a mental illness. 

 PHaMs is an innovative model for supporting people with a severe mental  illness in the community, rather than solely in medical services. Early  findings from an independent evaluation show that participants in the  program had more confidence to re-connect with mainstream health  services, learnt new skills and were less socially isolated.  

 This $80.3 million funding extension will allow services to continue for the  thousands of people who are already benefiting from PHaMs, as well as  new participants who can benefit from these services in the future. 

 There are over 170 PHaMs sites operating across the country, including  specialist sites that focus on people who are homeless, refugees and  Indigenous Australians.
