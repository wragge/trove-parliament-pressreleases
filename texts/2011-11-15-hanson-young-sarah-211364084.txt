 MEDIA RELEASE â AUSTRALIAN GREENS   SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG, SPOKESPERSON FOR IMMIGRATION   15 NOVEMBER 2011    

 No evidence Afghanistan safe enough for asylum seekers to be forcibly removed:  Greens 

 The Australian Greens have expressed grave fears for the welfare of an asylum seeker  the Australian government intends to deport back to Afghanistan this weekend. 

 “No matter what the Australian government says, we don’t believe Hazaras such as  Ismail Mirzajan will be safe in Afghanistan,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen.  Sarah Hanson-Young, said today. 

 “There are no guarantees that Hazaras will be safe, only a memorandum of  understanding between Canberra and Kabul which is unconvincing and widely criticized  for lacking credibility.  

 “Afghanistan’s High Commission for Human Rights says the country is dangerous.  Amnesty International made it clear today that Afghanistan remains very unsafe for  Hazaras. 

 “I have urgently written to the Immigration Minister expressing my concerns for Mr  Mirzajan. It now in the hands of the Minister stop the deportation and I urge him to  reconsider.”
