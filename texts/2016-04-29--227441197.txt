 Save the Children shocked and saddened by the death of Iranian man who set himself alight on  Nauru    

 The death of a 23 year old Iranian refugee on Nauru is a shocking tragedy, says Save the Children.     

 CEO of Save the Children Paul Ronalds said, "Our heartfelt condolences got to the young man’s wife,  family and friends. This horrific loss of life is yet another human tragedy to emerge from Nauru.     

 We know first-hand from our time on Nauru that prolonged and indefinite  detention, and the uncertainty associated with a lack of permanent resettlement  options for refugees on Nauru, causes serious harm. Recent events on both  Manus and Nauru demonstrate the unsustainability of present arrangements, and  that further serious and life threatening incidents are inevitable.   

 The Australian government must urgently broker a deal with a suitable third  country willing to provide permanent protection to very vulnerable people who  have fled persecution, war and violence.”
