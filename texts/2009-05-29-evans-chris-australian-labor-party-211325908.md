 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Funding to help settle new West Australians 

 Migrants, refugees and new citizens in Western Australia will receive additional  support to settle and participate in the community under the Department of  Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) Settlement Grants Program.  

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today that  24 programs in Western Australia will receive funding totalling $2.7 million in 2009- 10. 

 ‘These projects make a real difference to the lives of many new migrants and  refugees by helping them acquire the crucial life skills and knowledge about life in  Australia,' Senator Evans said.  

 ‘They aim to help new West Australians make the cultural transition and become self  reliant so they can make a valuable contribution to our society and the economy.' 

 Among the projects to receive funding is the Edmund Rice Centre's ‘Drive Safe'  program that provides practical driver education and training to newly arrived  refugees and migrants. 

 The $100 000 project incorporates a three stage theory education course,  preparation for the drivers' license test including practical driving instruction lessons,  post-license driving assistance and provision for training for participants to become  driving instructors themselves in the future. 

 The project will focus on refugees from Sudan, Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Somalia,  Congo and Burundi but is available to other migrants. 

 Other organisations to receive funding in 2009-10 include migrant resource centres,  multicultural service agencies, and community and welfare organisations, including: 

 â¢ $138 845 for Centrecare to provide youth camps  and school-based workshops on Australian life, the  legal system, nutrition, budgeting and sexual  health  

 â¢ $125 751 to help victims of torture and trauma  access health and counselling services   â¢ $124 200 to provide information sessions to  women in the Pilbara on women's health, 

 education, housing and other government services   â¢ $90 095 to assist refugee youths with  accommodation needs in the south metropolitan 

 area.  

 ‘I commend all the organisations in Western Australia for their contribution to the  positive and successful settlement of people who are new to our nation,’ Senator  Evans said. 

 In total, $34 million worth of funding will be provided to 205 different settlement  delivered through 136 organisations projects across Australia. A list of successful  applicants in the 2009-10 funding round is available on the DIAC website.  See: www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/delivering-assistance/settlement-grants
