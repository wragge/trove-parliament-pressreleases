  Subject: 
$124 million boost for the fight against illegal immigration

  E&OE

  PRIME MINSITER:

  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Mr Ruddock and 
I have called this news conference to announce the Government’s decision 
to provide a major boost to the capacity of Australia to fight the growing 
challenge of illegal immigration. I should point out at the beginning 
that so far the response to the increased threat of illegal immigration 
to this country has been highly successful. Today’s measures which 
are very significant are designed to preempt what we see to be an increased 
attempt by people from various parts of the world to engage in people 
smuggling into Australia.

  Australia has become increasingly attractive, not 
only because of the quality of life in this country but because there 
is a perception in some quarters that it is possible once one has arrived 
in Australia to use the legal system to stay here for a lengthy period 
of time even though one may have been initially arrived as an illegal 
immigrant.

  Today’s measures which provide $124 million over 
a period of four years do provide a major increase in the capacity of 
this country to improve the surveillance of its coast line, and importantly, 
very importantly, today’s measures increase Australia’s capacity 
to detect and deter illegal immigrants and immigration before they get 
to this country and before in some cases they commence their departure 
from the source country.

  There are nine principle measures contained in today’s 
announcement. Today’s announcement arises out of the establishment 
of a taskforce under the chairmanship of Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the secretary 
of my department, which I established in April of this year. I can report 
that every single recommendation made by the taskforce has been adopted 
by the Government.

  The principle measures involve two additional Dash 
8 aircraft to extend the footprint and the intensity of Coastwatch aerial 
surveillance, particularly along the east coast. And if you have a look 
at the map you can see, indicated in red, the existing regular surveillance 
area ,and the area in green, in outer areas that as a result of the 
new measures that I’m announcing today will come within the footprint 
of the surveillance activities. So we’re going to provide two additional 
Dash 8 aircraft and they will extend the footprint and the intensity 
of Coastwatch’s aerial surveillance, particularly along the eastern 
coastline.

  We’re going to provide an additional night capable 
helicopter to be deployed in the Torres Strait. We’re going to establish 
a national surveillance centre at Coastwatch’s Canberra headquarters 
with electronic links to State government agencies and defence establishments.

  We’re going to establish a new position of Director-General 
of Coastwatch who will report directly to the head of the Australian 
Customs Service, and this position will be filled on secondment by a 
senior officer of the Australian Defence Force. And liaison arrangements 
between Coastwatch, Defence and other agencies will be significantly 
strengthened.

  Importantly we’re going to expand Australia’s 
capacity to detect and deter illegal immigration from source and transit 
countries through posting twelve immigration officers to major source 
and transit countries, including as airport liaison officers at key 
airports.

  We’re also going to conclude bilateral agreements 
with source and transit countries for cooperation on people smuggling 
issues and to provide for the return of illegal arrivals. And we’re 
going to provide strong support for the conclusion as soon as possible 
of a protocol on people smuggling to the proposed UN Convention on Transnational 
Organised Crime.

  We’re going to establish a high level information 
oversight committee chaired by the Office of National Assessments to 
coordinate information and intelligence on people smuggling, and we’re 
going to introduce comprehensive legislative amendments which the Government 
will put before Parliament shortly to strengthen maritime investigatory 
and enforcement powers to complement legislation on stronger penalties 
against people smuggling.

  The Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, has indicated on a number of 
occasions over the past few months that there is a very significant 
increase in people smuggling activities around the world. It’s estimated 
that illegal immig  ration reaches something like 4 million people annually. 
Australia is clearly seen as a very attractive target. There’s no 
doubt about that. Australia is seen as a more attractive target than 
many other countries and that is because it’s a very attractive country 
in which to live, it has a very stable political system, it’s a very 
fair and open society, we have a very big coastline and importantly 
also we are seen, or we are perceived to have laws that do make it easy 
for people once they get here to tie up the legal system and stay for 
a long period of time. And can I say on that again that the Labor Party 
would help enormously the national interest if it facilitated the passage 
through the Senate of some legislation that will deal with that problem. 
And Mr Ruddock has asked them in the national interest on a number of 
occasions and I repeat that request today. Protecting this country against 
illegal immigration ought to be above partisan politics. And we’ve 
been trying for, what Philip, a couple of years?

  RUDDOCK:

  Yes, it’s been underway for some time now.

  PRIME MINISTER:

  It’s been underway for some time now to get this 
legislation through the Senate and if we could get it through the Senate 
it would send a very strong message to the crime syndicates in potential 
source countries who are trying to exploit the human misery involving 
people smuggling. It would send a very strong signal to them that we 
are no longer such an easy mark. But that of course doesn’t mean that 
we shouldn’t be taking other measures and the measures that I’ve 
announced today will provide a major boost to our capacity to fight 
illegal immigration, and it will as the map indicates, significantly 
increase our capacity for coastal surveillance. We’ve chosen areas 
which we believe will provide the greatest possible return from the 
investment undertaken. But these measures are undertaken in a preemptive 
fashion against future risk, not acknowledging that there’s been any 
past failure because the immigration authorities and the customs authorities 
and the Australian Federal Police have been very successful so far. 
And I want to compliment the Minister in particular for the skillful 
way he’s handled the very difficult issues including a number of very 
well reported examples in recent months of detecting a scheme for illegal 
immigrants to come to this country, sending a warning through our embassies 
in those countries that they shouldn’t even try, and those warnings 
being highly successful. But we’re not complacent and because of that 
we’ve decided to make this additional substantial commitment which 
we believe will dramatically strengthen our capacity to deal with illegal 
immigration. Any questions.

  JOURNALIST:

  Yes. Can you briefly outline what that legislation 
is that you think that you want passed through?

  RUDDOCK:

  Well there are two pieces of legislation. The first 
relates to penalties and it’s going to the Labor caucus this week. 
I would like to see it through the Senate. It can be attached to a bill 
that’s awaiting passage and in that sense we can deal with the increase 
in penalties very quickly if we get that level of cooperation. The second 
issue is in relation to judicial review. The bill’s been before the 
Senate for quite a while now. It was reintroduced at the beginning of 
this Parliamentary term. And the Labor Party and others have indicated 
their opposition to it. I’ve put a number of propositions to the Labor 
Party in the way of dealing with those people who are principally in 
detention. We might be able to put a privative clause in relation to 
those matters to expedite our dealing with people who are held in detention 
because judicial review can mean that you have to detain people for 
many years. And you know the sorts of difficulties that occur. We saw 
that in relation to the lady from China, that if you have people in 
detention over long periods of time exploiting all those possibilities, 
even though they have no lawful right to be here, it can produce that 
sort of opportunity for delay. The bill is one which is designed to 
enhance the decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal so that they would 
be final and determinative and that the option of going to the court 
for further judicial review would no longer be available.

  JOURNALIST:

  Isn’t it true that sometimes when appeals are made 
against the Refugee Review Tribunal decision that they are thrown out, 
and that person who’s allowed to stay? That’s the case at the moment 
isn’t it?

  RUDDOCK:

  Well it’s true that there have on rare occasions 
been decisions that have suggested that a legal, and sometimes I must 
say highly technical point can lead to a decision being revisited. But 
what we know is that over 9000 decisions over four or five years, less 
than 50 actually different outcomes were obtained through court intervention. 
And if you compare that with the final appeal which exists for everybody, 
which is the application to the Minister for exercise of discretion, 
I would have acceded in appropriate humanitarian cases to something 
like 150 cases over the same period of time. Now my view is any lawyer 
worth his salt ought to be able to put before me a substantial case, 
and they certainly don’t need to go to the courts at tens of millions 
of dollars to get a different outcome.

  JOURNALIST:

  Is it something you’ve discussed with the Democrats?

  RUDDOCK:

  It’s something that I discussed with the Democrats, 
Senator Harradine, the Greens, and Labor. But look, there is a lobby 
and the lobby has a degree of self interest. It’s a very profitable 
area. We’ve seen the marketing of class actions now by some members 
of the legal profession which have led to 5,000 people, most of them 
of course in the community as over stayers, but 5,000 people able to 
remain in Australia. In many cases accessing Medicare and until we limited 
access to work rights fairly recently, able to access work rights lawfully. 
And of course one suspects that many of them having maintained themselves 
here lawfully on a bridging visa because a class action has started 
are probably unlawfully working in any event.

  JOURNALIST:

  [inaudible]

  RUDDOCK:

  Well the penalties in the legislation involve ten 
years penal servitude as a maximum for being involved in people smuggling, 
and 20 years as a maximum penalty for those who are involved in people 
smuggling of 5 or more persons. Look there’s one other matter I would 
mention. I’ve seen in the press lately some comments that have suggested 
that we should have a fairly benign view in relation to people smuggling, 
that in some way these are people of great ingenuity and people who 
would eventually make outstanding Australian citizens and therefore 
we ought to put this issue as if it’s of little consequence to one 
side. There are very very important reasons why we have visa arrangements 
to test people’s eligibility to come, and we seek to enter people 
within a framework of law.

  It turns on the need to protect the Australian community 
not only from quarantine risks that can occur if people land clandestinely, 
which can jeopardise our economy in very significant ways but more importantly, 
people who come in this way, if they were able to land clandestinely 
may well have diseases, because they wouldn’t have been medically 
checked. Very often they come from places where tuberculosis is a major 
disease that impacts on these communities. And any view that you should 
turn a blind eye to these matters, as I have seen written in some pieces 
lately, I think shows a very scant regard for the broad national interest. 

  JOURNALIST:

  [Inaudible]

  RUDDOCK:

  Well there certainly are. We have been very successful 
to date in thwarting a number of very large scale people smuggling ventures. 
There was the 2000 people who were buying a passage on a vessel from 
Somalia which when it was disclosed that they had no lawful right to 
enter Australia they were very angry with the organisers, because they 
had been lead to believe that such a venture would be lawful. 

  Now we saw the same in Indonesia this last week, 
where 100 young Javanese males were the subjects of a people smuggling 
venture that was being put together. Working together with the Indonesian 
authorities we were able to properly brief people as to what their lawful 
entitlements were and to discover the extent to which they were being 
mislead by the organisers, they were being mislead to believe that what 
they were doing might well be lawful, they were being mislead into believing 
that that in due course there could be amnesties in relation to people 
who might get here, they were being mislead in relation to their ability 
to access employment in Australia. And one of the aspects of the measures 
that the Prime Minister has announced today will be an enhanced capacity 
to work abroad in alerting people to the way in which you do apply to 
Australia if you wish to come lawfully and the potential risks that 
befall you if you try to come unlawfully.

  JOURNALIST:

  What is the situation on the 
ground in Fujian Province, which is one of the big problem areas, which 
has been one of the centres of illegal immigration for more than ten 
years?

  RUDDOCK:

  Well it’s been a centre of illegal immigration 
to other countries. The arrivals in Australia in the past were primarily 
from Beihei and a significant programme was put in place complemented, 
I might say, by successful returns. And what we have been seeking to 
do in relation to the returns that we have been able to facilitate this 
year, on each occasion is to ensure that in the media in China attention 
is drawn to the fact that people attempted to enter Australia in this 
way, that they have been returned, that they were duped, that they suffered 
significant economic loss and that people ought not to be inveigled 
by false promises. While we have had some comments to say about the 
Opposition about where they could work cooperatively with us in some 
additional measures, I might say, that one of the very useful statements 
that was made recently, was that there would be no amnesty, for people 
who arrive in Australian unlawfully. The Government has affirmed that 
that is its position and the Opposition did, in relation to that matter, 
indicate that if at some stage in the future there was some change of 
Government there would be no amnesty that would be implemented by them. 

  So we are endeavouring to ensure that the message 
in the broadest possible way is brought to people in Fujian. The Secretary 
of my department went there along with Andrew Metcalf, who is the head 
of the board of control area and spent some time in the Fujian province. 
The head of our mission in Beijing was there with the last group of 
people who were returned from Australia. The media were informed of 
those matters at that time. I have spoken to journalists from a number 
of Chinese papers including the People’s Daily, to brief them, from 
here, on the way in which if people have an aspiration to come to Australia 
they should test those matters at our Mission, rather than being inveigled 
into these sorts of exercises.

  JOURNALIST:

  [Inaudible]

  RUDDOCK:

  I mean that is a, I said to the Prime Minister that 
he better be prepared for this question

  PRIME MINISTER

  And we are.

  RUDDOCK:

  And the situation is this. We locate something like 
12,000 people a year who are unlawfully in Australia. Now that is a 
large number of people. We estimate that there are 50 - 51,000 people 
who have overstayed visitors and so we would guess that more than 20% 
of people are located during the course of a year. Now when you do locate 
people you debrief them. You find out what travel documents they’ve 
got, when they came to Australia and how. And while we find an occasional 
stowaway, and stowaways have been a feature of illegal immigration over 
a long period of time, we have never yet found a person who has landed 
in Australia clandestinely and is here unlawfully. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  Prime Minister, the measures that you announced today, 
are they in response to the increase in targeting of Australia that 
has been noticed in recent years? Would they have been made without…inaudible

  PRIME MINSITER:

  Well, they are being undertaken because there is 
a heightened challenge to this country from illegal immigration, that’s 
obvious. The Minister has outlined the steps we have taken to prevent 
hundreds of people starting the journey to Australia. There have been 
some well publicised illegal arrivals and those people have all been 
successfully intercepted and they are being returned in an orderly, 
efficient and speedy fashion. 

  But we can’t be complacent. We have a big coastline, 
we are attractive and we’re seen at the moment, unfortunately in some 
source countries as having laws that do allow people, once they get 
a foothold here, to tie up the system for a long time. And we want to 
send a very strong message to the rest of the world that we are not 
only strengthening ourselves against illegal immigration but if we can 
get that legislation through the parliament that would send a very loud 
message to the rest of the world that the idea that we are a very soft 
touch is no longer valid and it is very important that we get that legislation 
through, very important indeed. 

  These measures will greatly 
strengthen, as you can see, the footprint is very significantly expanded, 
the green area illustrates the additional area that will be under regular 
surveillance and I think it is a very good investment and I think it 
will give a   lot of reassurance to the Australian public that 
we are alive to the threat posed by illegal immigration. You can’t 
eliminate it, you can’t stop people wanting to come to Australia. 
But you can send a very strong message to them that they can’t expect 
to be allowed to stay here and tie up the legal system. And you can 
also strengthen your country’s capacity to detect illegal arrivals 
and that is what we are doing and very importantly by sending additional 
immigration officers to source countries we’re increasing our capacity 
to seek out those who would seek to come here, tell them that there’s 
nothing in it and warn them of the consequences of coming. And that 
kind of preventative approach is a very good investment. It’s worked 
very well so far and we’re going to increase it by posting additional 
officers from the department, Mr Ruddock’s department to the potential 
source countries.

  JOURNALIST:

  What countries are they going to?

  RUDDOCK:

  The particularly places that they’ll be placed 
will be Shanghai, Guangzhou, New Delhi, Colombo, Nairobi, Pretoria and 
Ankara, and the airport liaison staff will be in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, 
Denpasar, Singapore and Dubai. If you look at the areas from which at 
the moment we are targeted and it’s both in relation to aircraft arrivals 
as well as boat arrivals. China has been significant. Areas like Sri 
Lanka, much of Africa, particularly through…from places like Somalia 
we’ve seen efforts and a good deal out of the Middle East, Iraq, Iran, 
more recently Bangladesh. Countries like Afghanistan, Algeria, have 
been the areas in which we are increasingly seeing unlawful movements.

  JOURNALIST:

  What boats do you know of that are heading this way 
and [inaudible]?

  RUDDOCK:

  Well they’re operational matters and we…..

  JOURNALIST:

  There’s talk of a boat sinking somewhere near the 
Philippines.

  RUDDOCK: 

  I’m not aware of such a matter but certainly we 
hear of matters from time to time. That’s intelligence information. 
That’s one of the reasons we want to have these additional staff.

  PRIME MINISTER:

  You can be rest assured we’ll provide what information 
we can but no information that might limit our capacity to deal effectively 
with the problem.

  JOURNALIST:

  [inaudible]

  RUDDOCK:

  No I wouldn’t say that either.

  JOURNALIST:

  People smuggling aside, the most unlawful, you know, 
the country from which most unlawful people are here, is that from the 
UK isn’t it? Is that right?

  RUDDOCK:

  Well look, let me just put to rest once again this 
furphy that we should be concerned about the number of over stayers 
from the United Kingdom. Look, amongst the people we locate, people 
from the United Kingdom are significant. Numbers of people we remove 
are significant. But in terms of the total numbers of visitors from 
the United Kingdom they are a very small proportion. If you take the 
major tourist countries, 1.6 million people from Japan, the United Kingdom, 
the United States of America, and you then look at say the high risk 
countries which would be China and say Vietnam, Lebanon, Turkey, what 
you find is that the numbers of people involved in visiting Australia 
are very small, certainly under 100,000. But something like 20% of people 
from those countries do not leave Australia at the termination of their 
visit. And that is a very very high non-return rate by any standard. 
And it’s for that reason that it’s necessary for us to test the 
bona fides of people that come from countries where the non-return rates 
are very high. And risk analysis suggests that it would be foolish of 
us to try and jeopardise the very significant tourism which benefits 
Australia significantly from countries which pose little or no risk.

  PRIME MINISTER:

  I think that’ll do us.

  JOURNALIST:

  [inaudible], how satisfactory are Australia’s coastal 
defences now with the……?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well they’ve always   been very effective, very effective, and they’ll 
be even more effective as a result of this commitment.

  JOURNALIST:

  At Scott’s Head or…..?

  PRIME MINSITER:

  Well they have always been very effective in answer 
to your question and these measures will make them even more effective. 
Thank you.

  [Ends]
