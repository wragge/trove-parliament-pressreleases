 TOWARDS A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP  SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER  NATIONAL PRESS CLUB - 19 JULY 1990

 It is now one hundred years since the beginning of the  process which led to the creation of the Commonwealth of  Australia - in Barton's phrase, a nation for a continent, a  continent for a nation.

 The Federal compact hammered out through the 1890s resolved  the competing claims of six distinct political communities,  their capitals and centres of population separated by  immense distances. It's easy to forget that our political  union was never a foregone conclusion. It involved give and  take, a capacity for compromise; and in the end, it was a  triumph of hard work, common purpose and political 

 leadership.

 Today we face together challenges impossible to envisage a  century ago. But the same qualities - the work, the will,  the leadership - which were needed to create the Federation  in the last decade of the nineteenth century are needed 

 again, in the last decade of the twentieth century, to make  the Federation work better.

 The time has come to form a closer partnership between our  three levels of government - Commonwealth, State and local.

 Our first task is to move by sensible, practicable steps to  get better co-operation within the framework of the Federal  Constitution as it stands. That is where I propose we focus  our main effort.

 Our second task is to apply the spirit of national  co-operation in a new approach to reform of the Constitution  itself.

 Today, I propose processes through which these tasks can be  achieved - sustained and substantial processes to explore  and map the areas where co-operation for common objectives  is not only desirable but realistically achievable.

 The goals are to improve our national efficiency and  international competitiveness, and to improve the delivery  and quality of the services governments provide.

 2 .

 We need to remove the impediments and the anomalies which  stand in the way of those goals.

 My friends, alone of the peoples of the world, we have a  continent to ourselves.  With all the marvellous diversity  of our land, with all the rich diversity of our people, we  share a commitment to a single national identity. Wherever  we live in this wide country, we adhere to the same 

 fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy, freedom  of the individual and the rule of law. And the Federal  system itself underwrites this diversity with unity.

 Yet within this splendid unity, we have imposed on ourselves  a burden of different rules and regulations and requirements  which needlessly weighs against the tremendous advantages we  can have as a nation-continent.

 We are proud that as a modern and prosperous society we can  provide quality services to people whether they live in the  city or the bush - but too often, essential services are  getting tangled up in bureaucratic overlap.

 The battling family in the city fringe; the Aboriginal  community in the remote outback; the frail aged at home or  in hospital - they don't want to argue the toss about which  bureaucracy provides the help to which they are entitled.  And their least concern is some academic argument of  Commonwealth versus State rights. And the instinct of the  people is correct.

 The real emphasis - our real concern - should be the rights  and needs of citizens, not as, say, Queenslanders or  Tasmanians, but as Australians.

 Now that might sound just a cliche. But what happens in  practice?

 Schools in different States have different minimum starting  ages, and different patterns of schooling at primary and  secondary levels, and different curricula, and different  ways of assessing Year 12 students - differences that give 

 totally unnecessary headaches not only to students who may  move interstate but also to employers and tertiary  institutions who look to the schools system to provide  meaningful standards for recruitment.

 Lawyers and doctors and other professionals may have . qualifications from the best universities in Australia or the world; skilled tradesmen may have the finest on-the-job  experience - but to work outside their home State they need 

 a licence from a State licensing board.

 How sensible is it to shrink what is already a relatively  small Australian market into separate State markets?

 3.

 â¢V.

 ' â  '* i-"

 Yet that is what we do:

 - when we force manufacturers to put different labels and  different packages on the same products;

 - when we give three different definitions to bread?

 - when one State demands that margarine be sold only in a  package shaped like a cube;

 - when each State has its own separate design  requirements for water meters; its own quality  standards for chemicals used in agriculture.

 Two States forbid a certain kind of heavy semi-trailer that  is legal everywhere else; there is no uniformity between  States on the time a truckie can spend behind the wheel;  each State issues its own driver's licences. Only last  month we at last managed to achieve in principle agreement 

 to prevent unscrupulous truck drivers from getting multiple  licences so they could flout the demerit points systems  wherever they liked. It took years of work - so I suppose  we can say with Galileo, 'Nevertheless,  it moves'.

 We cannot pretend to be serious about the global greenhouse  effect if we think in terms of separate State and national  strategies.

 Now, my purpose today is not to prescribe the changes to be  made to cure these absurdities and anomalies.

 I am not specifying outcomes.

 But I am describing the areas where I seek change through  co-operation; and I am proposing a process through which  change can be achieved - a process which will produce  results.

 I acknowledge, at once, the progress already being made  thanks to the hard work of the various Ministerial Councils  which bring together State and Federal Ministers and  officials across a range of policy areas.

 But the challenge is broader and more urgent - for us all.

 My friends, we all need to do some fundamental re-thinking -  and not just governments - but the major political parties,  the-business community, the unions,  opinion-formers.

 The question we all will have to answer is this: 'Are we  ready for the 21st century?'. And if the changes we need to  make are to be effective, we must all be prepared to take a  fresh look at ourselves - our way of doing things, at the  habits, the assumptions, the prejudices of the past.

 4 . 

 v

 And in particular I point today to the challenge facing us  in these areas:

 micro-economic reform;  financial relations;  delivery of services;  the national agenda for social justice; 

 industrial relations;  the protection of the environment;  and Constitutional reform.

 I mention micro-economic reform first, because it is common  ground that it is absolutely essential, if we are to have a  more competitive economy. It means we must improve the  performance of the structures which underpin the national  economy - it means better ports, a more modern transport 

 system, faster communications, cheaper power.

 My Government has acted to reform the financial system,  tariffs, aviation, telecommunications, taxation, and its own  business enterprises - areas of virtually exclusive  Commonwealth control.  We still have unfinished business on  our agenda.

 In advancing to the next stage, the co-operation of the  States is essential.

 The division of responsibility enshrined in our Federal  system need not and must not be an insuperable barrier  against co-operation.

 Look at the progress two sovereign nations - Australia and  New Zealand - have made in integrating our economies under  the Closer Economic Relations agreement.  Look indeed at the  progress the twelve sovereign nations of the European  Community are making: there will be less impediment against 

 trade of goods and services between them in 1992 than there  is now between the States of Australia.

 Here, key areas of our economy remain balkanised.

 The limited arrangements which do exist to share electricity  between States are hamstrung by inefficient pricing  restrictions,  hidden cross-subsidies between different  consumers and planning decisions which seem to accept State  borders as market barriers. Our aviation system remains  hobbled by regulatory fragmentation.  And our railways  remain burdened with the.legacy of differences between our  colonial engineers.

 5.

 A cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and  Perth may be subjected to: ‘

 - 3 non-integrated rail systems;  - 4 changes of locomotives; - 5 different safe working systems; - 6 different sizes of loading gauge;  - 10 different engineering standards of the basic 

 standard gauge rail track; - 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew  changes, refuelling, inspections.

 How, under such circumstances,  can rail avoid being a drain  on the taxpayer? And what of the impact of this situation  on Australia's international competitiveness?

 And how, with this set-up, can rail compete with road? One  offers door-to-door overnight service, tailored to suit  modern just-in-time inventories. The other must contend  with up to three rail authorities controlling the progress 

 of its freight, leading inevitably to confusion about who  has responsibility for delivery.

 We need to tackle these issues. In rail, for example, the  Commonwealth and the States are giving serious consideration  to a National Rail Freight Initiative, involving new  investment in track and terminal facilities; guarantees -  perhaps contractual commitments - to high priority 

 schedules; and new industrial relations standards.

 It is no exaggeration to say that the Initiative, to be  successful, will require Commonwealth-State co-operation on  a scale we've seldom seen hitherto in this country.

 But we must strive to achieve that co-operation - and not  just in rail transport, but over the whole range of  micro-economic reform. It is not so much an option, as an  imperative.

 My friends, in this national endeavour, we must, of course,  work within a basic macro-economic framework. Australia  must have one central level of effective economic  management. The level and incidence of taxation and public 

 sector borrowing should be primarily determined at a  national level.

 But let me say this, in the spirit of my genuine desire for  a closer partnership with the States: the imperative of  national economic management need not preclude worthwhile  change in Commonwealth-State financial arrangements.

 We are prepared, for example, to look at changes to the  Premiers'  Conference arrangements.

 Further, I announce today that the Commonwealth will respond  positively to the Premiers' requests in regard to financial  institutions taxes. We will relinquish the bank accounts  debits tax to the States.

 6 .

 A third point: the Premiers want more of their Commonwealth  funds in untied rather than tied form. And it is certainly  legitimate to ask whether tied arrangements limit program  efficiency. We may find a need to move away from tied  grants in a number of areas; and in other areas, a need to  change our arrangements so that we get better value for  money. It is timely and proper to consider this aspect of  our funding arrangements.  We are ready to do so.

 Friends, in the post-War period, the functions performed by  our Governments - Federal, State and local - have changed  radically.

 Behind this change, forcing its pace, there has been I  believe the irresistible and irreversible thrust of an  historic process - the working out in Australia of the idea  of progress and equality and the just expectations of a free  people.

 But too often in practice the result - especially in health  and welfare services - has been duplication of effort -  duplication, for example, of accounting and monitoring,  duplication of consultation and complaints mechanisms.

 Too often the financing and administration of a service is  shared between, or rather divided between, different tiers  of governments. Too often different governments are  providing closely related services, without proper  co-ordination.

 Such arrangements can actually distort the very design of  programs in the interests of shifting costs from one level  of government to the other - literally, passing the buck -  instead of serving the interests of the clients.

 Surely, when we think of all the money, skills and good  intentions put into these efforts, there must be a better  way of serving the needs of the people.

 We must find, as a nation, a better way of integrating the  legitimate policy interests of the Commonwealth and State  Governments and achieving more integrated and more effective  delivery of programs and services to our citizens.

 It is my belief that we should be ready to review all the  services which the Commonwealth and the States deliver.

 But I suggest the health and welfare fields would be the  most useful starting point for review.

 What I propose today is a process of program rationalisation  through joint examination with the States - a process which  yields practical results. I do not want a voluminous  comprehensive report at the end of some long unspecified  period of study. I want proposals to come forward case by  case; to be dealt with on their merits, case by case; and 

 specific decisions to be made, case by case.

 7 .

 Let us enter this process with these watchwords: precision and decision.

 In all this, the Australian Government can never avoid or  evade its genuine national responsibilities.

 In the first place, there are groups for whom the national  government has special responsibility - veterans,  Aborigines, newly arrived migrants and refugees, for  example.

 Moreover, only the national government can effectively  identify certain problems, which can vary widely in their  regional or local incidence, yet which may require a  national policy, financed nationally, for their solutions.

 But the experience of the years tells us that there are  important services which would be improved if the Federal  Government were not directly involved in their delivery.

 I emphasise that the joint review I propose is aimed at  achieving better services, better delivered. Any cost  savings - and of course there should be savings - would be a  bonus.

 And I give the assurance that, to the extent State  Governments take over any administrative responsibilities  for programs previously run by the Commonwealth, they will  be compensated, and compensated fairly.

 There are two objectives:

 - first, to put into better order the existing  service delivery system,

 - and then, to make sure that as we take up new  challenges, and governments undertake new  commitments, we don't create a new set of  problems, through overlapping and duplication of  responsibilities.

 This is especially relevant and important for the success of  the national strategy for social justice my government  pledged to pursue in seeking the people's mandate for a  fourth term.

 It is a national strategy: but the co-operation of the  States and local government is essential.

 The Australians living in the rapidly expanding urban  fringes are experiencing a special set of social problems -  not enough affordable housing; poor access to employment,   public transport, schools, hospitals and recreation.

 8 .

 Their problems - real problems, human problems, things that  people have to cope with every day of their lives - are  compounded by our failure to co-ordinate the delivery of  services across the levels of government.

 The co-operation of States and local government will be  needed not only to implement the strategy, but to supply the  information needed to identify and tackle the problems.

 And I believe that if we can move forward together with the  States on a new social justice agenda, the common effort  itself can give rise to 'a new spirit of co-operation which 

 can spread out to other fields.

 One such area is industrial relations.

 We have a profusion and confusion of industrial relations  systems. As a result, there are wide variations between  awards and work practices, determined by seven major  tribunals and a host of smaller ones.  It encourages 

 leapfrogging in wages and conditions and fosters uncertainty  for unions and employers alike as to whether their industry  is covered by Federal or State rules, or both.

 It's not just an inconvenience - it's an impediment to  stable wage fixing and sound economic policy.

 The Commonwealth and the States are already working to  improve the legislative framework. But the potential exists  for much more co-operation and co-ordination. My own  inclination is that it is a field in which the Commonwealth  should have ultimate responsibility, and I note with special  interest that the Premier of New South Wales for one has not  discounted such a development.

 My friends,

 Anyone familiar with the history of my Government would know  we have not shirked our national responsibility for the  environment. And we are not about to abandon that  responsibility.

 But my Government has always preferred co-operative  solutions. Indeed, the environment must increasingly become  an area in which common ground and common purpose come to  replace controversy and confrontation.

 The Commonwealth and States are already co-operating on  national air and water quality standards; the Landcare  program; management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;  and the Tasmanian World Heritage Area.

 My Government is determined to make sure that Australia  moves firmly along the path of ecologically sustainable  development.

 9 .

 We are working with business, unions and conservation groups  - and we seek the involvement of the States.  That  involvement includes their joining the sectoral working  groups which will make policy recommendations to the  Government.  These groups are to start their work shortly.

 There is clear merit in working together on these issues.  Commonly agreed environmental processes and guidelines,  where possible, will better achieve the objectives of the  Commonwealth,  States, industry, workers and the community.

 The same co-operation essential to the review of  Commonwealth-State program delivery which I have already  outlined will need to be applied to the sustainable  development process, if we are to achieve the best results 

 for Australia.

 Ladies and gentlemen,

 I must emphasise that there is an essential ingredient if we  are to produce substantial results from the exercise I  propose.

 It requires a commitment of leadership. Success will  depend, in the end, on both myself and the Premiers being  closely involved at strategic times, particularly in  decision-making. We must not allow the overall thrust to be 

 lost in a mire of bickering and intransigence in particular  subject areas. Of course the detail is important - but it  needs to be worked through rather than allowed to become an 

 excuse for saying that it is all too difficult.

 Accordingly I anticipate a number of special Premiers'   Conferences on these issues.

 I have today written to the Premiers proposing a Special  Premiers' Conference take place on 31 October and 1 November  in Brisbane. As far as I am concerned, everything I have  discussed today is on the table - from micro-economic reform  and program delivery to industrial relations and the  environment.  And I welcome further suggestions from the  Premiers as to what they want discussed.

 The first meeting should choose what should be dealt with  first and set in motion the immediate processes to make  decisions.

 Further, before the Conference, I plan to establish a  Commonwealth-State Steering Committee chaired by the  Secretary of my Department with equivalent State Government  representation. Its main role will be to arrange for the  preparation of papers for this first Conference and then in  broad terms to co-ordinate and advance future work.

 Moreover, I propose to set up forthwith a special group in  my Department headed at a very senior level to provide  continuing support.

 10.

 Of course, detailed involvement will be needed from  Commonwealth, State and other areas of specialist knowledge.   There must be consultation with interested groups.

 Such involvement and consultation will ensure decisions are  well informed. I repeat, however - they will not represent  a barrier to timely decision-making at the highest levels.

 Clearly, many of the issues for consideration directly  involve local government.

 I have therefore proposed to the Premiers that the Local  Government Association be invited to participate at the  Conference, on issues relevant to them.

 In my letter to the Premiers, I have emphasised that my  Government is prepared to commit itself to new processes  pursued in a new spirit to improve our Federal system, and  urging that they and their Governments make the same  commitment.

 Ladies and gentlemen,

 I now come to the area of reform which we must acknowledge  has proved most difficult to achieve - the Constitution  itself.

 It is true that there have been very significant changes in  the way we govern ourselves, within the existing  Constitution.

 The most significant of these has been the uniform taxation  system - a war-time measure which has profoundly changed the  relations between Federal and State Governments in 

 peace-time.

 High Court decisions have done more to alter the  Constitution than all the referendums.

 And there has been, without change to the text of the  Constitution, quiet and constructive adjustment in the roles  of the Federal and State Governments in such areas as family  law.

 Thus, without actual change in the written Constitution,  there has been considerable change in the role and  responsibilities of the three levels of government.

 That is why, in these remarks, I have focussed my thinking  in terms of a broad process of change, through consultation  and co-operation - a process we can get moving on now.

 But, I also believe we have to seek new paths towards a more  contemporary Constitution.

 11.

 I-

 r N  ’ ·

 One of the reasons why so many valuable proposals have been  defeated at referendums over the last ninety years has been  that, almost invariably, they have become entangled in party  political controversy.

 Now, I do not condemn that out of hand. In itself, it  reflects the strength of our democracy - and the main source  of that strength is the vigour of our great political  parties.

 Nevertheless,  it is a plain fact of our history that it is  almost impossible to amend our Constitution in an atmosphere  of partisan controversy.

 Therefore, I believe we need to take a new approach -  creating a continuing process to identify the areas of  agreementf  to achieve Constitutional change.

 Next March and April will mark an important Australian  anniversary - the centenary of the First Australasian  Constitutional Convention.

 As I pointed out at the beginning, the work of creating the  Australian Commonwealth took ten years.  There is gathering  interest about what we do over the next ten years, the years  remaining before the Centenary of Federation in 2001.

 I want to give momentum to that interest.

 A Steering Committee is being established to develop  arrangements and an agenda for a Constitutional Conference  next year to mark the centenary.

 I am delighted to be able to say today that the former  Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen has indicated his  willingness to chair this Steering Committee.

 This is not to be a government - run conference - but the  Commonwealth government intends to support it financially  and in other ways - and participate in it. And I hope State  governments will do likewise.

 My hope is to break away from the situation where the  Commonwealth Government considers and puts to referendum  proposals for amendment of the Constitution only to find  that we do not have the requisite support from the States or 

 other parties, or support that evaporates in the heat of  partisan controversy. We owe it to the future of the  country to test a different approach, one in which proposals  emerge from collective discussion and deliberation.

 Some proposals may emerge which can be taken forward in the  next couple of years. Equally, in some areas the process ,   might not bear fruit until closer to the Centenary year of  2001. How long, for example, must we all go on accepting 

 the merit of the four year term without achieving it?

 12.

 I may say that I take encouragement from recent comments by  the Leader of the Opposition Dr Hewson, indicating his and  his Party's wish to bring a bi-partisan attitude to  questions like the 4-year term. If that support is 

 sustained, I would propose a referendum on a four year term  at the next Federal election.

 But whether we are looking at early proposals or ones to be  put later in the decade, we should start now.

 For the Commonwealth's part, we shall be there in April, we  shall listen with close attention and we shall participate  constructively.

 I will be personally involved, and I sincerely hope the  Premiers and the Opposition leaders will join with me in  this very important exercise. Continuing involvement at  this level will ensure the success of proposals for change  which will certainly emerge.

 Friends,

 In all that I have said today, the operative word is  'achievable'.

 We cannot re-write the Constitution. We cannot replace the  Federal system.

 But we can make the Constitution and the Federal system  under which we live work better.

 I have outlined an achievable, yet wide-ranging agenda for  change and reform in the way we govern ourselves.

 I have proposed a process - or rather,  a range of processes  - by which we can move together towards reform in a measured  manner.  It is a process which, I am convinced, can give us  a workable machinery to create a closer partnership, a  genuine partnership, for the better governance of this great  nation.
