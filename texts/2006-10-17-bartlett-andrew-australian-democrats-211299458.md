 Settlement Services Will Aid Integration Under Humanitarian Program Not  Further Dog Whistling

 Democrats' Deputy Leader Andrew Bartlett has slammed the federal government's suggestion that  refugees and humanitarian entrants should be required to learn English before they can come to  Australia.   

 The suggestion is contained in discussion paper on the adequate provision of government settlement  services to refugees.   

 "I have a real concern that the government is creating a situation where refugees and migrants are again  being targeted and division in the community is being fuelled," Senator Bartlett said.   

 "It is simply outrageous to impose English requirements on refugees fleeing war torn countries who may  have lived for decades in refugee camps.   

 "A humanitarian program is meant to be just that. It's not a process where we apply restrictive conditions  of entry or have outlandishly high expectations as to a refugees initial language competency.   

 "It would be far better for the government to adequately fund courses in Australia. A stable and secure  environment is a much better one in which to try to learn a new language.    

 "History shows us that refugees are keener than any other migrant to learn the language and begin  rebuilding their lives and contribute to their adopted homeland.    

 "Australia's migrant settlement services are in need of an overhaul. The size and variety of our migration  intake has changed dramatically, and the funding and effectiveness of settlement assistance for them  needs to improve with that new reality. Better funding and availability of English language classes would  be a good start.   

 "While we must do what we can to ensure that refugees entering the country have a good understanding  of where they are coming to, we shouldn't be putting in place unreasonable barriers to their obtaining  refuge. We need to do better with our support services for all migrants and refugees, not just making it  harder for them," Senator Bartlett concluded.
