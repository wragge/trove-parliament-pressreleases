 ROGER PRICE MP Federal Member for Chifley

 SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY MEETING Federal Member for Chifley Roger Price MP said that he was pleased to have met with people from the local community over a cup of tea today.

 The community meeting, held at Glendenning Neighbourhood Centre today, drew an audience of over 25 people from Glendenning, Plumpton, Hassall Grove, Oakhurst and Dharruk.

 Mr Price said that, while the number of people attending was smaller than previous meetings held at Doonside and St Marys, it gave people a greater opportunity to raise both individual and wider concerns.

 Blacktown City Council ward 5 Councillor (and former Mayor of Blacktown City) Charlie Lowles was also at the meeting to discuss local government issues and to help people find solutions to their council problems.

 “There are obviously a broad range of issues concerning the people in the Chifley electorate”, Mr Price said.

 Topics of discussion included superannuation and unfair retirement incomes policies of the Howard Government, women in the workforce, the government’s policy on refugees and asylum seekers and the overwhelming community opposition to a Badgerys Creek Airport. There was also discussion on Australia’s development of renewable energy sources, the impact of the GST on small businesses in Western Sydney and the proposed Western Sydney Orbital.

 “I will continue to meet and keep in touch with the people of my electorate. It is important for me to be across the issues that are of concern to our community - and this is one very good way of doing that”, Mr Price concluded.

 Ends 10 September 2001
