 Support for innocent civilians fleeing Libyan violence   

 The Australian Government today announced an additional $4 million in humanitarian  assistance for the growing number of people fleeing violence in Libya.    

 Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said the Australian Government is extremely concerned about  the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Libya.   

 "The additional $4 million will support the UN High Commission for Refugees and the  International Organisation for Migration as they assist the estimated 300,000 people who  have fled Libya into Tunisia and Egypt since mid-February.  It brings Australia's total  assistance to Libya to $15 million, making Australia the third largest donor to the crisis," said  Mr Rudd.   

 "Humanitarian agencies are scaling up their operations at Libya's border crossings,  particularly the crossings into Egypt, and the IOM and UNHCR are playing a key role.   

 "UNHCR are providing shelter and emergency assistance to refugees, and the IOM are  continuing their valuable work to de-congest the border crossings by facilitating the onward  movement of foreign nationals."   

 Australia strongly supports the request by the United Nations for humanitarian agencies to  be allowed access to all parts of Libya in order to assist the civilian population and alleviate  the suffering of those affected.     

 Australia also asks for safe passage of civilians wishing to leave the conflict areas and for  respect to be given to medical teams treating the sick and injured.   

 The total international humanitarian contribution to the crisis now stands at over $100  million.
