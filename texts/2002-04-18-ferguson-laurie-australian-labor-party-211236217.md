 MIGRANT SERVICES FUNDING SQUEEZED AS RUDDOCK SPENDS UP

 Migrant services continue to be told the funding cupboard is bare while the Government splurges out on its so-called Pacific Solution.

 It is unbelievable that the Government is spending $114 million housing and processing asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru.

 We doubt the Government has yet revealed the true cost of the Pacific Solution.

 But what we do know is that it is spending nearly three times as much in Nauru and Manus Island as it is providing in funding to migrant welfare organisations.

 Total funding this financial year under the Community Settlement Services Scheme, the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy and for Migrant Resource Centres totals just $43.4 million.

 Minister Ruddock has even told Commonwealth-funded migrant services in NSW that no extra funding is available to meet the additional award costs that they face. He suggests they should reduce their staff working hours.

 The Ministerâ€™s claims are hard to believe in the light of evidence given by his Department this week. That evidence suggests he has no difficulty in finding ever increasing amounts of taxpayer funds for his processing centres in Nauru and Manus Island.
