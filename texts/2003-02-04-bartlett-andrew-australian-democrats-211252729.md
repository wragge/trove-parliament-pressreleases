 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Defence 

 4th February 2003 MEDIA RELEASE         03/054              

 Senate says Iraq issues must be dealt with through UN, not USA   

 The Senate has made a clear statement that the disarmament of Iraq must proceed under the authority  of the United Nations.   

 “The Prime Minister’s statement on Iraq does not make the case for the war nor outline a pathway to  peace,” the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Andrew Bartlett, told the Senate in his  response.   

 The motion, moved by the ALP, is expected to pass the Senate with Democrat and cross bench  support this evening.   

 The Democrats moved an additional motion calling for the Senate’s resolution to be communicated  to Governments of all members of the United Nations Security Council.    

 “The Democrats urge the Prime Minister to use Australia’s relationship with the US to ensure this  conflict does not escalate to nuclear war.   

 “We also urge him to ensure the Australian people's views, as well as Mr Howard's, are heard and  respected by the USA,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 Senator Bartlett also expressed concern at reports of plans for military actions that would target  civilians, pointing out that this would be in contravention of the Geneva Convention.   

 “In his long statement on the evils of Saddam Hussein - the Prime Minister did not mention that  Australia is still seeking to send asylum seekers escaping Iraq, back to that country.”   

 “Without a UN mandate, the Democrats believe that any military action would be not only highly  dangerous but also illegal under international law. However war crimes equate to major atrocities  such as genocide. I emphasise that in my view this would not make Australian soldiers war criminals.   

 “The Government has prepared documents relating to increased defence expenditure for a war on  Iraq but has refused to release those documents when the Democrats requested them. The  Government consistently says ‘no decision has been made about our involvement in a war with Iraq’  but they already have a budget.   

 Senator Bartlett said that with 750 military personnel involved in the 1991 Gulf War, there are now  around 164 Gulf War veterans receiving some disability compensation pension for disabilities  causally related to the Gulf War, and nineteen of them are assessed as Totally and Permanently  Incapacitated - TPI.  He also noted that the health survey of 1991 Gulf War veterans is still not  publicly available, despite being due in late 2002.
