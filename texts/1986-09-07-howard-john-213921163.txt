 KEYNOTE ADDRESS

 TO THE

 FORUM FOR FREEDOM  

 .SYMPOSIUM ON AUSTRALIA'S DEFENCE

 BY THE-

 HON JOHN HOWARD MP  

 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 DALLAS BROOKS HALL  

 VICTORIA PARADE  

 MELBOURNE

 7 SEPTEMBER 1986

 1.

 Peace and freedom are the noblest aspirations of mankind.

 It is appropriate, then, that the Forum for Freedom should   hold this symposium on Australia's defence.

 Australia's Defence Forces have made an immensely important   contribution to the fact that our country has lived in   relative peace for most of this Century.

 The Liberal Party stands second to none in the belief that.   there is no greater moral or political issue in our time   than the securing of a just peace.

 Peace is above all a moral issue, for it touches upon the   greatest of all human questions - how we can all live   together in harmony based upon tolerance, mutual respect and  

 a recognition of the desires of all people to be free.

 Although this great issue may be a moral one, the means of   achieving our ends are essentially political.

 The rhetoric of peace must be turned into the reality of   peace by political action. *

 Peace is not something which can be won simply by wishing;   it is something which can only be won by working.

 I have no quarrel with the ultimate goal of those who march   under the banner of the Nuclear Disarmament Party.

 I want peace. We all want peace.

 Where I profoundly disagree with some is on the best way to   secure that peace.

 The lesson of history is very clear - peace will never be   achieved if free nations unilaterally lay down their arms   and hope that the totalitarian dictatorships (of either left   or right) will do likewise. .

 The basis for a lasting world peace is a series of effective   and verifiable agreements leading, to reductions of nuclear   and conventional weapons on- both sides.

 For this reason, all of us must hope that the continuing   disarmament negotiations in Geneva lead to a significant   reduction in nuclear weapons on both sides.

 The Liberal"Party strongly supports all practical steps   being taken to remove the threat of war and secure the   benefits of a just peace which promises so much for so many   people throughout the world. .  ,

 This can best be achieved by Australia participating in   international efforts to promote peace and secure genuine   disarmament while at the same time strengthening our role in   the Western Alliance.

 2 .

 This means that Australia must continue to shoulder her   responsibilities under ANZUS and maintain our agreements   with the. United States over the Joint Facilities at   Pine Gap, North West Cape and Nurrungar.

 It is important to remember that it is in Australia's self   interest to host these Joint Facilities. This fact is too   often overlooked by some commentators.

 It is regrettable that the Australian Bicentennial   Authority's National Program of Projects and Events glosses   over the service to the security of our nation given by our   Defence Forces in World Wars I and II and in Korea,  Malaya,  

 Borneo and Vietnam. .

 The sacrifice of our servicemen, and women was primarily   borne by young Australians. The Anzac legend should play a   key role .  in any record of the Australian achievement.

 The prime responsibility of government is to.protect the   life,  liberty and property of its citizens - from both   internal violence and external attack.

 The, greatest threat to freedom in this Century has come from   totalitarian regimes - Hitler's Germany and the Soviet Union   of Lenin and Stalin and their heirs. .  ,

 Many of the members of the organisations associated with the   Forum for Freedom well recall that during the time of the '   Nazi-Soviet Pact the two totalitarian giants teamed together   to put Eastern Europie to the sword.

 Hitler's Germany was crushed by the force of arms. .

 But the Soviet Union, remains a committed ideological power.

 This basic truth appears to be lost on those who,  more often   than not,  give the "benefit of the doubt" to the Soviet   Union regarding its conduct-of international affairs.

 It is the failure to either comprehend or accept the   realities of communist totalitarianism which underpin the   false proposition that the United States is as much to blame   as the Soviet Union for international tension.

 The brutal monuments to communist totalitarianism give the   lie to the notion of "moral equivalence".

 We should remember that this year marks the 25th anniversary   of the Berlin Wall. .  '

 The world has watched Soviet tanks rolling into Budapest,   Prague and Kabul. .  .

 We have seen the human misery which followed the so-called   "liberation." of Vietnam to communism.

 3.

 It was Hanoi wh ich.supported the rise of Pol Pot in Cambodia   - a'fact,conveniently forgotten or ignored by the Left in   Australia who enthusiastically sided with North.Vietnam   during the Vietnam w a r .

 In the Baltic .  States, Eastern Europe, Indo-China, Africa and   Central America, wherever it has triumphed, communist .   totalitarianism has brought repression instead of freedom;   shortages rather than plenty; economic stagnation instead of   growth. .

 These are the realities which must, be faced if we are   serious about defending freedom. .

 They are no less real in this region of the world than   anywhere else. .

 Only last Thursday Mr Ludwig Chizhov, the Head of the USSR's   Pacific Department,  said that the recent Soviet build up in   the Pacific region "are just what are necessary in response   to United States' action".

 This is a totally unconvincing explanation.

 The ever growing build up of the Soviet Union in the Pacific   region is a matter for deep concern and should be taken into   account in any assessment of Australia's strategic   situation. .

 THE DIBB REPORT AND AUSTRALIA'S DEFENCE

 The Opposition has welcomed Mr Paul Dibb's Review of   Australia's Defence Capabilities as an important   contribution to the consideration of Australia's longer term   strategic planning. ;  .

 The Review has generated a level of public debate and   discussion on defence issues rarely evidenced in Australia.

 In this respect alone,  the Review has already served a .

 valuable purpose in reminding the community that the   effective defence of this nation has always -. and will .   always be - the most basic responsibility of any Australian   Government.

 It is this basic truth which has guided both our   deliberations of the Dibb Report and the review of the   Coalition's Defence policy.

 On page 1 of the Review, ·  Dibb lays down the premise which   effectively underpins the entire Report: namely that Australia does not face an identifiable military threat and   there is "every prospect that our favourable security  

 circumstances will continue". According to Mr Dibb:

 4.

 "It would take at least 10 years and massive   external support for the development of a   . .  Regional capacity to threaten us with

 substantial assault." .

 Dibb therefore proposes a defence capability for Australia   which would be able to meet lower level threat contingencies   through a layered defence network. .

 This layered defence, underpinned by a strategy of "denial",   would be northward oriented and provide an ADF capability in   an area which Dibb defines as our area of direct military   interest. .

 While Dibb recognises that Australia's strategic interest   extends beyond a 1,000 nautical mile range,, he sees no value   in having an ADF capability to project power beyond that   range. ·  ’

 The Review argues that while:

 "We have some security interests outside this   Region [of direct military interest] .7. these are beyond the effective exercise of our  military power." .  .  .  -

 Therefore, according to the Dibb thesis, Australia should   not be in the business of having a Defence Force capability   which would be able to make a military contribution beyond   its area of "direct military interest".

 THE COALITION'S RESPONSE TO DIBB

 In terms of specific procurement recommendations the   Opposition has already indicated support for a.number of   proposals which will enhance the Australia's Defence Forces   (ADF's) capabilities. .

 The Coalition fully supports higher level surveillance and   intelligence facilities and the upgrading of Australia's   northern defence presence. .

 At the same time, there are other procurement   recommendations of Mr Dibb which we,believe would be .   shortsighted and unduly restrict the capability of the ADF.

 But our principal concern with the Dibb Report goes beyond   specific procurement recommendations.

 As a document which is supposedly to be the basis of   Australia's future Defence Force structure, we find it   fatally flawed in the strategic assumptions and in defence   strategy proposals which flow from these assumptions.

 The Coalition's concern with the Dibb Review relates to the   two fundamental theses.on which ADF force structure   recommendations are based. .

 5.

 The first is that Australia does not face an identifiable   direct military threat. According, to Mr Dibb, even with a   change in strategic circumstances,  the development of a   regional capacity which could threaten large scale assault   on Australia would take at least 10 years.

 Therefore according to Dibb, defence planning should be   predicated on developing a Defence Force structure capable   of dealing with low level contingencies. ;

 Dibb seeks a defence planning strategy which will respond to   a "best case" threat. .

 But Australia cannot conduct long term defence planning on   the "best case" basis of low level threats.  Dibb's readily   identifiable "no threat for 10 years" is not equivalent to   "no threat" at all. .

 Australian Defence Force structure based on a strategy of   "denial" seriously hinders Australia's ability to influence   events positively within the Region. .

 Dibb pays little if any attention to any military   responsibilities Australia has under the now bilateral ANZUS   Treaty. .

 For Dibb, any military contribution beyond the direct   military interest region should only be undertaken as a   "gesture of support". .

 In claiming that: .  .

 "The presence of.the Joint Facilities, :  .

 together with the access that we provide to   visits by United States warships and the   staging through Australia of B-52 bombers, are   a sufficient tangible contribution to the .

 Alliance",

 Dibb effectively comes down on the side of Australia   fulfilling its minimum responsibilities to the Australian-US   A11 iance.  ''

 While building the capacity to defend Australia is a   supremely worthwhile objective, it cannot be achieved by   blind adherence to force structures which exclude all   significant, capabilities to project military power  

 throughout Australia's strategic environment.

 Australia's A D F .structure should not be such as to close off   all meaningful possibilities for close and active   co-operation with the United States and regional allies.

 Instead, Australia must be able to actively assist the US in   its global mission of deterring the Soviet Union in our own   region.  .

 6.

 REGIONAL REALITIES

 The Coalition is also concerned with Mr Dibb's assumption   that there is an intrinsic stability within the Asian and   Pacific region. .

 This assessment is far too sanguine.

 In post-Marcos Philippines, President Aguino confronts   massive problems of political, social, economic and military   reconstruction.

 Of crucial importance is whether Mrs Aquino can effectively   control and wind back the insurgencies of the Islamic   separatists in the South a n d , more importantly, the   Communist New Peoples Army in the North.

 The New Peoples Army remains the strongest Communist Party   among the ASEAN nations with forces numbering approximately   16,500. _ '

 Both.the Indonesian and US governments have expressed   concern that President Aquino's concilitory approach to the .   NPA is not working.

 Despite the peace overtures offered by the Aquino   Administration, the NPA is reported to be seizing more   territory arid show no sign that they are willing to end   their insurgency activities. .

 Thailand continues to face a major external threat from   Vietnamese troops on the Thai/Kampuchean border.

 Vietnam remains as a major source of regional tension.  With   1.2 million in the armed forces, Vietnam maintains the   world's fourth largest standing army.

 Hanoi's military forces outnumber those of all other South   East Asian countries combined. There appears to be little   prospect that Vietnam will withdraw any of its 170,000   troops from Kampuchea.

 While Dibb informs us that Australia's defence capabilities   have become a matter of judgement, clearly the soundness of   that judgement wholly depends on the validity of the   Review's assumption about continuing regional security.

 Australian defence planning cannot overlook the capacity   within the Region for rapid changes in the political   climate. .

 7.

 SOVIET POWER IN THE PACIFIC REGION

 Mr Dibb's benign assessment of Soviet intentions in the   region is also open to serious question.

 There is a far too complacent attitude to the Soviet, build   up which has occurred over the past 15 years.

 Over this period the Soviet naval presence in the Pacific   has grown by 80 per cent. .

 The Soviet Pacific fleet now totals 720 ships,  including 125   submarines, 80 surface combatants as well as the- .   Kirov-class "Minsk" aircraft carrier.

 Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam has provided Moscow with a   deployment flexibility of a warm water port. The .   acquisition of Cam Ranh Bay together with Da Nang has   expanded Soviet naval operation reach by 2,000 nautical   miles, placing in jeopardy the Asia-Pacific Region's vital  

 economic life lines. *

 The Soviets have transformed Cam Ranh Bay into the largest   forward-deployment naval base in the world with the addition   last year of Badger bombers and MIG 23 Flogger fighters. "

 More recent reports indicate that the Soviets are now   increasing the range.of Pacific operations including   anti-submarine warfare, sea trialling of the first   Akula-class nuclear attack submarines and the deployment of  

 Foxhound MIG 31 Fighter planes which have, a 2,100 km radius   of operation. -  .

 Along with a quarter of total Soviet military manpower about   one-third of the USSR's SS20 warheads are deployed in the   Soviet Far East.  .  .

 These missiles are targetted on East Asia and the Pacific.   The possibility that the longer range land mobile SS-25 may   find its way to the Soviet Far East would add a new potency   to an already formidable Soviet strategic presence in the .   region. .

 The sheer size and operational capability of the Soviet   Union in the Pacific underlies the necessity of the United   States deterrent in our region. Moreover it clearly   reinforces the crucial role Australia must continue to play  

 in supporting the US deterrence capability.

 It is quite clear that Moscow has recently now renewed its   efforts in pursuing economic and political opportunities   within the region. .  ’

 Fiji, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and   Western Somoa have received offers of Soviet economic . co-operation.

 8.

 Kiribati has entered into an agreement with the Soviet Union   which allows 16 Soviet fishing boats unrestricted access to   Kiribati's maritime economic zone. .

 Similar fishing deals have been offered by the Soviet Union   to Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Western Samoa.

 COMPLACENCY CONCERNING THE SOVIET BUILD UP

 Regrettably within some areas of Government and public life   in Australia, there is a false sense of complacency   concerning the Soviet military build up and, indeed, towards   the nature of Soviet totalitarianism itself.

 For example, Australia's Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr Richard Butler, has gone on record as maintaining that   Mr Gorbachev "is a Soviet leader of a kind we've never seen   before ... in the period since Stalin", that Gorbachev .  

 believes that the Soviet system doesn't work and must be   completely changed, and that to achieve such a Change he   will have a "wind down" the USSR's "military industrial .   complex".

 I don't believe that this analysis stands up to serious   analysis.  . . .

 Take Afghanistan for example. :

 In that sad country, 100,000 of Mr Gorbachev's troops are   literally putting the local population to the sword by   conducting a war of staggering brutality and oppression.

 Afghanistan has lost over one quarter of its population   through death or refugee outflow since the Soviet invasion -   one million dead or wounded and four million refugees who   are now living in Pakistan and Iran.

 According to Dr Robert Simon who has spent time in   Afghanistan, the Soviet forces there "are committing .   atrocities that rank with those of Nazi Germany".

 If Mr Gorbachev is the new Soviet man that Mr Butler .   maintains he is, then perhaps he could exhibit his   credentials by ending Soviet military rule by terror and   force in Afghanistan.  .

 Mr Andrew Mack, who was recently appointed by the Australian   National University to head Australia's first Government   funded Peace Research Centre, has also expressed quite   remarkable views on the USSR.

 Mr Mack has maintained that "there's no doubt that the   Soviets are genuine" on arms control whereas the United   States is appearing to "drag their feet" on this issue.

 9.

 As far as I am aware,  Mr Mack has never altered the view he   expressed the week after Soviet troops began to roll into   Kabul. - namely the USSR was engaged in an act of "defensive   aggression". To the Afghan dea d, the wounded and the   millions of refugees, I'm n o t .sure that it makes any  

 difference whether the Soviet Union is engaged in "defensive   aggression" or the more familiar 'aggressive aggression". The corpses pile up whatever the methodology.

 Although written from a different perspective Mr Dibb has   expressed in his recently published book - The Soviet Union;   The Incomplete Super Power - that the USSR has a   semi-developed and grossly inefficient economy, a poor   standard of living, and is technologically backward.

 Maybe. 1

 But these factors have not stopped the Soviet Union ruling   most of Eastern Europe like an imperial power. Nor has it   prevented Moscow's brutal suppression of Afghanistan.

 Mr Dibb has written that "the USSR is more likely to be   preoccupied with its domestic problems than indulge in   external adventurism of a highly dubious kind".

 Well, we shall see. But I would not want to plan   Australia's long term defences on the assumption that Moscow   does not want to establish preponderant military power in   the Pacific region. ·

 AUSTRALIA'S ALLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES

 Both the Government and the Opposition support Australia's   Alliance jwith the United States.

 However, the Opposition is increasingly concerned that the   Hawke Government is increasingly viewing Australia's role in   the Alliance in terms of a "minimalist" approach.

 The Government's enthusiasm for the recommendations of the   Dibb report, encompassing a reactive defence posture based   on the defence of Australia, is the latest evidence of a   tendency towards minimal alliance input. .

 Examples abound of the Hawke Government wanting to show the   left wing of the Labor Party that Australia is "independent"   from the United States.

 This has reached the point where the Government is prepared   not only to dissent publicly from authoritative American   assessments of Soviet intentions within the Region, but also   either to question or refuse to assist in American military   programs of critical significance to the continued stability   of the global balance. .

 10.

 With regard to the latter, the Hawke Government's reversal   on the MX was one of the worst examples of the   Prime Minister's failure to show clear leadership.

 Similarly with the Hawke Government's decision to oppose the   Strategic Defence Initiative - in spite of the fact that for   almost twenty years the USSR has been building up its.   strategic defences.

 Yet both of these programs are ,  viewed as critical by the US   to the continued stability of the central strategic balance   with the Soviet Union. But the Hawke Government .

 nevertheless felt prepared to distance itself from both the   MX and the SDI in the interests of appeasing the Socialist   Left.

 The clear concern of the Government to try and limit the   number of US warships visiting Australian ports (especially   Fremantle) was evidenced in 1985 on several occasions.

 On one of these, the Government came close to admitting that   it had asked. Washington to reduce the number o f ‘visits to   Fremantle, only to resile from this a day or so later.

 The impression which could be created by such hesitations is   that of a Government trying to. do the minimum possible to   meet its obligations under the Alliance.

 In a speech last May to the Council.of Foreign Relations '   (which was not publicly released), Mr. Beazley: .

 ’  . recognised that there was. an "ongoing .

 awkwardness" in Australia's bilateral . relationship with the United States and said   that he had detected "some concerns" in the   US about the direction of Australia's defence   policy; .

 . .  admitted that "there are possibilities for   discordance" between Australia's defence  objectives and the United States' concern to   maintain a solid Western Alliance strategy to  

 counter the growing military power of the ·  .

 Soviet Union; and . .

 .  . acknowledged that the Hawke Government did not share the strategic perceptions of the United   States concerning the need to provide an   effective deterrence to the USSR.

 Of course,.Mr Beazley went on to maintain that all is well   with the Australian-American relationship. This, after all,   was to be expected. Yet his speech was an important   admission that all was not completely as it should be. .

 11.

 The Dibb Recommendations and the Government's apparent   enthusiasm for what is essentially an isolationist approach   to defence planning will do nothing to downplay what   Mr Beazley has termed the "possibilities of discordance".   But the responsibility for the maintenance of good Alliance   relationships rests equally with both Australia and the   United States.

 It is my hope that the United States Administration   understands that their lack of responsiveness on the wheat   subsidy issue has provided the Socialist Left and opponents   of the Alliance a stick with which to beat the Alliance.

 SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE TREATY

 The Hawke Government's enthusiastic support for the South-   Pacific Nuclear Free Zone'Treaty is a further manifestation   of its desire to placate the left wing anti-nuclear and   anti-American sentiment.

 The Hawke Government has spent an inordinate amount of time   and diplomatic energy championing this Treaty.

 Although Mr Hawke and Mr Hayden see it as a landmark   Australian contribution to the cause of disarmament and   peace,  the reality is that makes no such contribution.

 In particular the Treaty does nothing to further our   security interests in the Pacific region.

 For example, the nuclear free zone encompassed under the   Treaty does not include the Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay in   Vietnam. In other words, a nuclear free zone, would do  

 nothing to stop the USSR moving nuclear capability into the   Pacific. It is little wonder that the Soviet Union is such   an enthusiastic supporter of the Treaty.

 Furthermore, the Treaty has the potential to unduly restrict   a future Australian Government from providng home port   facilities to the United States in times of heightened  

 regional or international tension.

 While the Government.may argue that under the Treaty the   transiting of nuclear weapons through the Region is   allowable, the Treaty makes no allowance for a changing   strategic environment which may necessitate more than the  

 transiting of United States and British nuclear capable   forces.

 The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is a diversion   from the real task of achieving meaningful arms control.

 Arms control agreements will be achieved in Geneva, not in   Raratonga. .

 . 12.

 Rather than promoting the amorphous and unrealistic .

 proposals contained in this Treaty, the Hawke Government   should be directing its energies to supporting US efforts to   achieve fifty per cent reductions in offensive nuclear   weapons.

 ANZUS AND THE FIVE POWER DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS

 The Dibb Review proposes that a strategy of denial more   closely suits Australia's strategic conditions.

 In Dibb1s own words the strategy of denial is essentially a   "defensive strategy". The force structure recommendations   made in the Report - for example:  .

 .  . low level F-lll refit; '

 . low capability light patro l.frigates; and . .  .  recommendations concerning the role of armour in the Army,

 flow from this concept.  .  “

 Clearly a denial strategy precludes a Force structure   capable of projecting and maintaining power beyond bibb's   1,000 nautical mile area of direct military interest.  .

 As such the adoption of the denial strategy., and the   associated ADF structure to fit this strategy, severely   limits Australia's ability to fulfil its Alliance and Treaty   obligations. .

 Australia's principal defence treaty obligations arise from   two agreements which are still active: the now bilateral ANZUS Treaty and the Five Power Defence Arrangements.

 Under ANZUS, Australia has had to meet two principal   obligations. First, to practice "continuous and effective   self help and mutual aid". Secondly, to consider an armed   attack on a Treaty partner in the Pacific area an attack on   Australia requiring a response to meet the common danger in   accordance with our constitutional process.

 Clearly our responsibilities under ANZUS have required   Australia to maintain a Defence Force capable of Satisfying   the requirement for "effective self help". .

 The maintenance of a credible ADF has therefore always been   a crucial element of our ANZUS responsibilities.

 Under ANZUS Australia must also stand ready to provide aid   to the United States if that country is attacked in the .   Pacific Area. .

 The ADF. must therefore possess the capabilities necessary to   render such aid if Australia is to discharge her ANZUS   commitments effectively. .

 13.

 Australia also has obligations under the Five Power Defence   Arrangements with the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore   and New Zealand.

 Our responsibilities under FPDA require us to provide   personnel to assist in. the training and development of .the .   Malaysian and Singaporean Armed Forces, provide facilities   in Australia, provide expert assistance in operational and  

 technical matters and provide assistance in supply of   equipment to the Malaysian/Singaporean Defence Forces.

 The Arrangements also provide for the stationing of   Australian Forces in Malaysia and Singapore.

 Yet the ADF presence in the area has been scaled down over   the years. The Whitlam Government withdrew the ground force   component and in the near future the RAAF presence from   Butterworth will be withdrawn.

 After 1988 the RAAF presence will be limited to scheduled   fighter squadron deployments and two P-3C Orion LRMP   aircraft based at Butterworth. .

 The importance of the Five Power Defence Arrangements has   not declined. .  .

 But it appears that the Hawke. Government has downgraded its   importance.

 THE COALITION'S APPROACH

 A nation's defence force structure must be generated out of   its strategic circumstances, its economic capabilities and   human resource availability for defence purposes.

 The Coalition recognises that·a threat to the stability of   the. Region - even if no apparent direct threat to   Australia - is a threat to Australia nevertheless. .

 Australia is part of its region whether we like the fact or   not, and threats to regional stability are by definition   threats to Australia as w e l l .  .

 This being so, we believe that it is better to prevent   threats developing rather than attempting to cure threats   after they have developed. .

 Therefore there is a clear requirement for a Government to   have a range of options available to maintain regional   security. These options in the first instance would be   economic or political.

 However, in some cases a military option may be the most   effective. We are of the view.that an ADF structure be as.   such that would enable future governments to have these   options if required.

 14.

 It is therefore important that Australia's military strategy   provide more than a "denial" capability.

 Australia also needs a deterrent strategy capable of   convincing potential adversaries that gains to be had   through resort to force are·outweighted by the costs.

 Unlike the Labor Party,  which must continually grant   concessions to its left factions or face crippling splits,   the Coalition ,  is wholeheartedly behind the ANZUS Alliance.

 Australia must retain the capabilities in its Defence Force   to provide meaningful support to our allies. .

 Australia must also be capable of providing a credible   military input within our region at the request of our   neighbours.  .  .  .

 In force structure terms, the Coalition's commitments to:

 .  deterrence as well as denial;  .

 .  our Alliance obligations; and *

 .  the need for Regional security,

 all imply requirements for capabilities in the ADF above and   beyond those necessary for the. limited, defensive and   insular strategy of "denial" alone which the Government has   adopted.· .

 The capabilities needed for the deterrent facet of the   Coalition's strategy must go hand in hand with the   wherewithal to contribute meaningfully to Alliance   obligations and regional stability. Neither are prominent  

 in the Dibb pure denial approach. .

 Denial is important,.but it is not enough. Deterrence is   necessary as well if Australia is to credibly protect her '   national security interests. .
