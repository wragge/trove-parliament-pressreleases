 Forest Industries Association of Tasmania  Annual Dinner

 Wrest Point Casino, Hobart - 18 June 2004

 Well thanks very much for that very generous introduction and welcome and good evening  ladies and gentlemen. 

 It's a real pleasure for me to again be with the forest industry in Tasmania and I'm indeed  honoured that I've been invited to be with you tonight. 

 Ladies and gentlemen I do want to recognise just some of the luminaries in the Tasmanian  forest industry who are with us tonight. Of course that description clearly relates to the  Chairman and President of the Forest Industry Association of Tasmania, John Gay, and John  thank you very much for having me with you.

 I want to recognise Glenn Britton, a member of a fourth or fifth generation industry family in  Tasmania. And of course the Clennetts family are here. Owen Muscat from the Country  Sawmillers Association who's also on the TCA National Board. And the people who keep the  industry moving like Evan Rolly, Terry Edwards and Kate Carnell and any number of other  people all very, very important and playing a significant role in the forestry Industry in  Tasmania.

 Ladies and gentlemen I am conscious that on a night like tonight very often the rest of the  audience don't like politicians acknowledging other politicians. But tonight I'm going to repeat  what your MC has already done and acknowledge a lot of my political colleagues, some  friends, some not so friendly in the political sense to me, but I think it's important to  acknowledge them because it does demonstrate the seniority and the breath of support for this  industry. 

 And of course I particularly want to acknowledge the Premier of Tasmania, the Hon Paul  Lennon, a great friend of the industry, Senator Paul Calvert, the President of the Senate, a very  well known Tasmanian and another great friend of the industry, and Senator Eric Abetz,  Tasmanian to the core and Special Minister of State. I think Rob Valentine from the Hobart  City Council, the Lord Mayor was to be with us. The Hon Bryan Green, your local State  Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources, and a guy who I've come to know pretty  well in a lot of different meetings we have relating to forestry and other matters. Will Hodgman  from a political family in Tasmania, very well known, representing Rene Hidding the Leader of  the Tasmanian Opposition. Sid Sidebottom, the Member for Braddon, a great guy. Dick Adams  a good friend of mine - I don't quite understand his politics but not a bad guy all round, Paul  Harris MLC and Allison Ritchie. And a number of Mayors with us tonight Peter Wilson, Don  Hazell and Nick Cracknell.

 So ladies and gentlemen I think it is important for the industry to understand just what support  it has across the whole spectrum of political life in our country.

 It is, as I say, always a great pleasure for me to be here with the forest industry in Tasmania. In  my 2 ½ years as the Federal Forestry Minister, I visited most of Tasmania and met with a lot of  people who champion this State.

 And I'm always so very impressed with the long-term commitment shown by companies and  individuals working in the Tasmanian forest sector - a sector that employs one in ten  Tasmanians and contributes about $1 billion directly each year to your State economy.

 I am delighted to hear of the bumper year the housing and sawlog industry has had. I have to  say as a national Government we take some credit for that.

 Our booming, yet carefully managed, economy just didn't happen by chance. It has taken a lot  of hard work and it's taken many difficult decisions, but the results are there and I'm delighted  to see that the forestry sector has benefited from our economic management.

 I am very proud of the Howard Government's on-going support for the Regional Forest  Agreement here in Tasmania and of the fact that the RFA has contributed to the indisputable  fact that 40% of Tasmania is locked away in reserves that will forever protect the unique  natural wilderness of this State and some of Australia's very special trees.

 I am also proud that the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, which was signed by a Liberal  Prime Minister with a Liberal Premier, is still in force and is still as strong as ever today  strongly supported by both the Labor Premier of this State and the Liberal Leader.

 The Howard Government's commitment to the RFA process can be no more clearly  demonstrated than by our action in ensuring that the first Bill to pass through the Senate in this  term of Government was the Regional Forest Agreement Bill.

 And I well remember that very joyous night and I know there were a number of you at it, when  that Bill finally overcame the Greens filibuster to become law. And what a great night that was  that night.

 Ladies and gentlemen the National Government's support for the Regional Forest Agreement  continues.

 We honour both the clauses of the Agreement and the provisions of that Act of the Federal  Parliament. That's the Federal Government's position.

 I don't need to remind any of you but the Labor Government in this State is totally supportive  of and committed to the Regional Forest Agreement, as is the Liberal Party in this State.

 Nor do I need to remind you that when the RFA Act passed through the Federal Parliament it  had the support of the Labor Opposition - then led by Simon Crean, a former Primary  Industries Minister and a union official with a history of commitment to jobs for his union  members. I guess in that way, he was very much like your current Premier, Paul Lennon, who is  dedicated to the forest industry not just because it's right for Tasmania, but because it provides 

 jobs for workers.

 But unfortunately, I have to express some anxiety about the actions of the Federal Opposition  in Canberra.

 I am anxious that the current Leader of the Federal Opposition appears to be playing fast and  loose with the forest industry, without much concern for the industry itself and the workers  employed in it. He's doing that when it comes to appealing to voters in marginal urban  electorates on the mainland.

 I can understand your frustration when your futures, your families, your livelihoods are the  playthings of the latte set in Melbourne and Sydney.

 Tasmania should not be disadvantaged to appease the consumer conscience of uninformed,  wealthy urban communities.

 It seems to be the position of some of those in our major urban populations - misinformed as  they are - that they would rather import wood products from other countries, where forestry  practices may not be sustainable, than support our forest industry and our sustainably managed  forests.

 I keep getting signals that the Federal Labor Opposition won't sacrifice workers jobs in the  Tasmanian economy to gain favour with the Greens political party.

 But the Federal Opposition Leader is developing a bit of a reputation for saying one thing to  one audience he is trying to impress and a different thing to when it comes to being held  accountable on his website.

 So, who knows what he might do if, a few days before the Federal Election, his pollsters tell  him that he's within a hair's breath of becoming Prime Minister and all he needs is a few  additional Green second preferences.

 I would expect that your industry could rely on a united, voluble and serious campaign by the  union movement as a whole, if that sort of treachery was ever embarked upon.

 I have already acknowledged tonight several members of the Federal Opposition from this  State and not for one moment do I question their commitment to the Tasmanian forest industry.  I know those who are with you tonight are great supporters of the industry and I know that they  will remain true to that.

 But this is a very serious matter. It's your future at stake and we do need to ensure that the  bipartisan support for the forest industries continues.

 Ladies and gentlemen I now want to turn to the Resource Planning and Development  Commission's Inquiry on the Progress with the Implementation of the Tasmanian Regional  Forest Agreement.

 I think it is possibly the worst kept secret around, but of the 30 recommendations by the RPDC,  there is no issue between the Tasmanian and Australian Governments with 25 of them. The remaining 5 recommendations are subject to discussions between the two Governments.

 Even where the Commonwealth believes that the RPDC could have gone a little further on a  recommendation or two, there is nothing in our position that will seriously impact upon the  industry, the Tasmanian economy or workers jobs.

 I hope to be able to formally release the Commonwealth's response to the five year review of  the RFA in the very near future and at the same time, to table a joint implementation strategy  between the Australian and Tasmanian Governments which Bryan Green and I are currently  working on.

 There will always be areas where we believe that the forest administration and management  throughout Australia could be done better.

 We will be making our views known to all the relevant forest managers in the various States,  including Tasmania, but bearing in mind that forestry management is the constitutional  responsibility of the States it will be up to the States to work with us in what I believe will be  very appropriate suggestions to help ensure that an even more sustainable and progressive  forest industry ensures for the future.

 Ladies and gentlemen the future of our forest and wood products industry depends on the  ability of governments, communities and the industry to work together to attract more  investments to use our increasing fibre resource, to value-add and provide the products  consumers want and to address our trade deficit in forest and wood products. We need to be  able to work together to consolidate and develop markets; and we need to work together to  maximise and promote the benefits the industry provides to all Australians.

 To do this we need an innovative and dynamic approach to forest management to ensure  Australia continues to lead the world in sustainable management practices, research and  development.

 The Australian Government has initiated a number of investment strategies for further  investment in the forest industry across all of the States and it is planned that later in this year  or early next year, Tasmania will host a meeting of the stakeholders from all of the major  commercial forest areas around Australia to develop the framework for a new Vision for the  industry.

 This meeting will build upon a series of Regional Forest Investment Workshops being  undertaken across mainland Australia and it's identifying actions necessary to fully develop the  full range of benefits the Australian forest estate can provide.

 The things we want to look at in those seminars are the establishment, or the exploitation one  might say of the latest technology, we want to look at security of resources, downstream  processing, and environmentally friendly pulp and paper mills to stop us having to import much  of our paper products from overseas.

 On that note, I see the Tasmanian Government has completed its review of the Environmental  Guidelines for New Bleached Eucalypt Kraft Pulp Mills. I'm very much looking forward to the  conclusions of that review.

 Ladies and gentlemen the Australian Government has played its part in encouraging investment  that ensures the necessary resource is available for the future.

 Our support for the Regional Forest Agreements is mirrored in the support for the plantation  industry with the amendments to the taxation legislation that saw the re-introduction of the 12  month pre-payment rule.

 And the Prime Minister's Energy Statement delivered earlier this week will mean big savings  for those in the forest industry using petrol or diesel in the off-road part of their forestry  operations.

 The Australian Government, along with all of the States particularly Tasmania, have been great  supporters of the Australian Forestry Standard, a soon to be internationally recognised standard  through its association with the Programme for Environmental Forest Certification (PEFC) that  is independently and professionally audited to ensure its integrity. And while I'm talking about  the RFA and the independent professional audit that does ensure the integrity of the Australian  Forestry Standard, I do want to congratulate both Gunns Limited and Forestry Tasmania for  being amongst the first to be certified for that very important AFS standard. So congratulations  to both Gunns and Forestry Tasmania. 

 It's also good to see John Gay and the Gunns people, Glen Britton and members of his family  and also as I mentioned before the Clennetts Family, I'm told that those three families, those  three companies are just three notable in Tasmania that have been in business in this State for  over 100 years. And they must have been doing something right and I'm sure that they will all  go on for the next 100 years because they are making a major and significant contribution to  Tasmania and the Tasmanian economy. And it's great to recognise companies like those that  have had such a longstanding commitment to the industry and who I know will be there for  many, many years to come. 

 Ladies and gentlemen I think it is important to the Australian economy and indeed to the  world's environment and ecology that we do continue to maintain a progressive and sustainable  forest industry for Australia. And I am committed to doing that. Unfortunately that  commitment that I have and I know many other politicians in this room have, that commitment  is not shared in the Federal Parliament by those, who the ill informed might expect, would  become from the strongest advocates for a sustainable industry.

 Most environmentalists around Australia, and I think that includes all of us in this room, would  want Australia to use wood and paper products that are sourced from the most environmentally  friendly forests rather than being hacked from forests overseas in a way that should be of  genuine concern to even the most radical green groups.

 But that concern certainly in the Federal Parliament is not demonstrated by the Australian  Greens Political Party. I, Eric Abetz and Paul Calvert have I must say the misfortune to have to  sit in a parliamentary chamber in the National Parliament and listen to some of the left wing  dogma that comes from the Greens political Party but we have to. I have to say that after  listening to them in the Senate as I am forced to do, I am quite uncertain as to what the Greens  policy is on the environment.

 The Greens claim to be the great upholders of democracy and the institution of the Parliament,  as well as the environmental watchdogs.

 But in the past 2 ½ years that I have been in this particular job rarely have I heard the Greens  expound within the Parliament of the nation much about the environment at all.

 Certainly after 2 ½ years as the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, and as the Minister  representing the Minister for the Environment in the Senate, I can only ever recall being asked  one question at Question Time by the Greens about the environment.

 They never turn up to Estimates Committees to question me or the room full of my bureaucrats  about environmental or conservation policies.

 I'm not sure if you are aware what the Estimates Committee process are, but it allows all  Senators to come in, question me, question the Government bureaucrats on every detail, on  every aspect of the various policies that we have.

 But when the opportunity is available for the Greens Senators to question the Government on  the environment they simply don't show. In fact it's the second time this year in the Estimates  Committees where the Greens have had that opportunity and simply did not show up.

 And then when their laziness and hypocrisy is exposed they lie about the reason for their  absences.

 But the real reason for I think their absence is quite clear. Away from the theatre and the  television cameras they're not prepared to engage with myself or my bureaucrats in one-to-one  debate on environmental policy. Simply because they have no genuine sensible policies that  can stand any scrutiny. And I'm sure they can appreciate that in a one-to-one debate at Estimate  Committees they would be shown up for the environmental frauds that they are.

 However, I have to say that being of a generous nature as my Parliamentary colleagues will no  doubt acknowledge, I'm always prepared to give people the benefit of the doubt.

 So I thought that although I don't hear about the environmental policies of the Greens political  Party in Parliament or in Estimates Committees, that I'd have a look elsewhere.

 I must say I am indebted to my friend and colleague, the Member for Farrer, Mrs Sussan Ley,  who alerted me to the fact that the Greens have a website which I understand is constantly  updated.

 So I felt quite sure that I would find on the Greens website what their real concerns were about  the major environmental issues of the moment. I wanted to get their views on the weeds  problem which is one of the greatest environmental concerns I believe Australia faces at the  moment, it's not terribly sexy - the latte set in Melbourne and Sydney aren't too interested in it  but it is there. I felt sure that these paragons of the environment would have a comment about  that very serious issue and also about the plans which the Howard Government has to embark  upon very significant protection for one of the world's great natural wonders, that is the Great  Barrier Reef.

 I was sure that going to the Greens website I would find a comment about the problems of the  environmental flows in the Murray Darling Basin, or something about the protection of  endangered flora and fauna. So I turned to their website.

 Yesterday's leading issues on page one of their website included; the American treatment of  Iraqi terrorists, world refugee day rally; a rally to bring home the troops, the slaughter of black  Sudanese people and some comment about the relationship, and I can't quite follow this,  between governments, NGOs and the corporate sector.

 There was also some comment on the boardroom decisions being taken by the ABC, although  why the Greens would complain against the ABC organisation that gives them and their ultra  left wing views totally disproportionate publicity, I fail to understand.

 So having failed to find too much out about the Greens environmental policy from the home  page of their website I clicked onto their "hot issues" page.

 There I found that the hot issues of the day were public education, the war against Saddam  Hussein's regime, the US Free Trade Agreement and there was I have to confess though one  item entitled climate change. On reading the first paragraph of that article it seemed to suggest  that the cause for all of our problems of the climate change was because of the "American  invasion of Iraq".

 Last week's leading issues on their website seemed to be about abolishing ATSIC, reform of  the Senate - I'm sure the President would have read that very carefully, there was some  comment there about gay marriages, prisoner abuse, the extradition of a couple of crooks from  Hong Kong and Hicks' August trial.

 Now ladies and gentlemen that's all fine in a democracy. Groups of politicians certainly are  encouraged to have diverse views on a wide range of subjects.

 But most voters don't vote for the Greens for their ultra left wing views. If they wanted those views to be converted into action in the National Parliament they'd vote  for the Communist Party.

 But most people vote for the Greens because they believe they are supportive of sustainable  forestry, saving cuddly koalas, all important environmental issues.

 It's not the left wing views of the Greens that I object to, but rather the fraudulent way in which  they garner votes for their left wing social and political philosophies by masquerading behind  the green image.

 I'm not sure from the material that I've seen on the Greens website that any prospective voter  concerned about the environment would get any great comfort from casting a vote for that  political party.

 However the voters would get a real buzz from the Greens website on-line poll.

 And my, doesn't their little poll show a bit of sensitivity when old mates fall out.

 Of the massive number of 392 people who responded to their on-line poll, only 28% in this  Green poll thought that Peter Garrett's installation as the Labor candidate for Kingsford-Smith  was a great thing for the Australia. 31% on this poll on the Greens website described it as a sell  out, 11% said 'it would end in tears.' I must say by this time I was almost in tears myself! And  ominously I might say for the Labor Party, 28% ticked the box that said 'Good luck - he'll need  it'. All of which suggests to me that perhaps Mr Latham has made a monumental mistake in  hoping to get Greens support for what Green supporters see as a great green sell out.

 So it was all terribly interesting. If you have nothing to do and want a good laugh or want to  divert some peoples attention to what the Greens are about when you're having a beer with  them one day, get them to have a look at the Greens website and you'll see what frauds they are 

 when it comes to the environment. 

 But ladies and gentlemen before I leave the subject of political parties website, I should  mention during my research on the Greens website, I happened to come across the home page  of the Communist Party of Australia. Yes, it still does exist! And I wonder if you would be  surprised if I told you that the riveting articles that appeared highlighted on the web page of the  Communist Party of Australia had a very familiar ring about them. They were about the defeat  of the US Free Trade Agreement, terrorism and the US wars of conquest, David Hicks'  charging and the opposition to Australia's terrorism bills. 

 And would you believe, that one thing both websites have in common was a very intense attack  on what they saw as the sell-out of Peter Garrett to the Labor Party. 

 So ladies and gentlemen an interesting night if you've got nothing better to do. Have a look at  those websites and note the similarity.

 But ladies and gentlemen tonight is a social night so enough of that sort of thing. We are of  course fortunate to live in a democracy where we accept and support the right of individuals to  their own view. But what we do have to do in Australia is to ensure that Australians know the  true facts and are not hoodwinked by the deliberate dishonesty of the ultra left in our society  and I might say a compliant media.

 Ladies and gentlemen I know I can count on your support to expose the great lie in Australian  politics.

 You certainly have my total commitment to that goal.

 Ladies and gentlemen I do thank you very much again for inviting me along to join you  tonight. My very, very best wishes for a successful future for your industry and all of those  many of you who make their living or who simply exist because of the forest industry in  Tasmania whether you're directly involved or indirectly involved. So I wish you and all who  rely upon it a very successful future for this industry. 

 Can I also express my very best wishes to the Forest Industry Association of Tasmania. The job  of the Association is not an easy one but it is essential and I again congratulate the President  and your very hard working CEO on all of the work that the organisation does and from the co-operative way it deals with our Government and I know the Tasmanian Government and I  know the Tasmanian Opposition. You've got a great organisation and I do really appreciate the  work it does and I congratulate them for it.

 Finally ladies and gentlemen, can I encourage you all, although I know my encouragement is  probably not needed, can I encourage you to be proud of your industry and on the contribution  that your industry makes to our nation - in the past - at the present - and I know in the future.

 Ladies and gentlemen again thank you for honouring me by allowing me to be with you on this  very important night.
