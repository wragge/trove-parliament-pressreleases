 Government’s New Centre: A  Band-Aid Solution 

 

 The Government’s decision to set up a temporary detention facility in Tasmania, will fail to fix  Australia’s broken immigration system, warn the Australian Greens.  

 “This is another short-term, band-aid solution from the Government. This is being announced  as a temporary measure, but where is the long term plan?” asked the Greens Immigration  Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.  

 “This new centre won’t ease the pressure on vulnerable asylum seekers. We don’t support  new centres being built while there is no time limit on how long these people are locked up.”  

 “ The Government is failing to acknowledge that the reason they have a problem is the long-term detention of people and the massive delays in processing. 1000 people who have  already been found to be genuine refugees, remain in detention due to the Government’s  own delays.”   

 “Rather than tinkering around the edges, this failing system needs a total review and  overhaul. Once people have their initial health and security checks done and aren't a risk to  the community they don't need to be locked up. Australia is the only country that does this -  it is impractical, inhumane and costly.” 

 “We need an end to mandatory detention - with time limits on detention and judicial review. I  have a Bill before the Parliament that would achieve this. I encourage the Government to  look at this as a common-sense approach to putting this mess behind us,” said Senator  Hanson-Young.
