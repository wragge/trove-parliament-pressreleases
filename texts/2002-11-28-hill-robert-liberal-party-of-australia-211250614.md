 John Bray: A Life Devoted to the Rule of Law

 It is a great honour to be delivering the John Bray Memorial Oration tonight. John Bray was a man of letters, a classicist, and a man whose life was devoted to the rule of law. He set high standards as Chancellor of this great university and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of this State. He was of course also a wonderful teacher and mentor. Regrettably I didn’t take his course in Roman Law as Latin wasn’t my strong suit. To do so would have helped my understanding of both the "jus ad bellum" and the "jus in bello" - the laws relating to the right to wage war and the laws within which the war might legitimately be fought. That however was not my focus in the late 1960’s.

 Not only was Bray a distinguished lawyer and judge, but he was also an outstanding and versatile poet. His poetry was concerned with the impact of historical events and figures, and the concerns we have today in relation to history. He captured our frailties and our fears, and most importantly, hope for the future in a world of change and uncertainty.

 Bray was intensely interested in the classical world and its connection to today. An example of this can be seen in one of his better known poems, The Bay of Salamis. In this poem, Bray meditates upon the great Greek tactical triumph over the Persians. On a September day Themistocles - who of course was both a statesman and a naval commander - seized victory and thus began the triumph of Democracy as an ideal for which to strive. Yet the poem ends on a sad note, because Bray perceives how democracy is under threat in the modern age. He says:

 And the numbers Pythagoras taught to dance in such delicate diagrams

 Have somehow resolved themselves to a set of evil equations

 Which only await the discovery of a means of perpetual motion

 To dispense with their human ministers and blow up the world on their own.

 As we know only too well, another momentous September day brought about a major turning point in the history of human kind. Additionally, and all too tragically for so many Australians, 12 October will also be a day that will pass in infamy. I wonder what John Bray would have written about the horrific events of these two days? He might have been even more horrified than any of us, because Pythagorean genius had been put to the chilling misuse that Bray had predicted in his poem. He might also have questioned, as we question tonight, what effect this cataclysmic event has on the rule of law, on democracy, and on the spirit of Themistocles.

 It’s depressing that terrorists driven from Indonesia by authoritarianism have now returned and so abused the freedoms of Indonesia’s new democracy by killing Australians and Indonesians.

 Terrorism is not a new concept. But the events of 11 September 2001 and 12 October 2002 have highlighted the extremes to which terrorists will go in order to achieve their ends and the global scale of their terrible ambitions. It is the combination of terror with the use of such destructive technology and executed by non State players to achieve strategic effect that presents major new challenges for Australia and our global and regional allies.

 It’s interesting that although the attackers are non States they nevertheless claim to be "at war". In some way purporting to be at war is seen by them as giving a legitimacy to their horrendous conduct. Where we accept this characterisation rather than just a gross criminal act, as we have with Afghanistan by contributing to the "war against terror", we accept the rules relating to the right to respond and how to fight, but rules that may not exactly fit these new circumstances.

 Thus we wrestle with the issues of what responsible action can be taken using the well-established tools of international security that are provided by International Law, Diplomacy and the use of Military Force in order to contain and hopefully defeat global terrorism - a threat that does not fit easily the well established paradigm of security between States.

 I can no longer claim to offer legal opinion but I can put the questions and challenges facing those responsible for governance. And I can suggest that there is a responsibility for the lawyers as well as the politicians to find answers to these questions.

 Setting the Context - Change in the International Environment

 We are now more than a year on since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.

 It is a year in which we have seen the post Cold War strategic landscape emerge in sharper focus.

 And it is a year in which any view that the impact of September 11 was merely transitory has been proved wrong.

 The horrific loss of life in Bali confirmed that September 11 was not an aberration - terrorism remains a key security threat, and people going about their everyday lives continue to be at risk.

 Over the last year, we have witnessed the demonstrated capacity of transnational terrorism to cause

 indiscriminate devastation even by relatively unsophisticated means.

 We have seen the continuing rise of non-state players within the broader strategic environment.

 We have been confronted by the disproportionate power that weapons of mass destruction can provide to relatively weak or failing states.

 And we have been forced to consider the potential threat to global security posed by non-state actors -particularly should they succeed in their efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction.

 As evidence mounts of the web of terrorist links around the world, it is clear that our security is inextricably linked to global security.

 This has always been the case, but that nexus has been even starker since September 11.

 At home we have boosted our counter terrorism and incident response capability, tightened security, introduced new terrorism legislation and cemented cooperation with the States and Territories through an Inter-Governmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism.

 We are also working to bring to justice foreign citizens who murder Australians overseas through the creation of a new extraterritorial murder offence.

 Abroad, we have actively contributed to the international coalition against terrorism, not simply because of our relationship with the United States, but because it is a threat to Australia and Australians as Bali so tragically demonstrated.

 In a world where the reach of terrorism is not limited by territorial borders the security of Australia and Australians depends on concerted international action.

 We are playing our part across the board - through bilateral agreements, diplomacy and collaboration in areas such as law enforcement, intelligence and tightening of border controls.

 Eliminating the terrorist threat is not achievable through military means alone - it requires a multi-pronged approach within a framework that starves terrorists of resources, constantly disrupts their networks to keep them off balance and holds perpetrators accountable.

 It also needs concerted and continuing efforts to address poverty, inequality and injustice - all contributors to an environment supportive of ideological fanatics - and to buttress institutions and groups that promote tolerance and moderation.

 In grappling with these challenges, the international community needs the certainty of an agreed and relevant legal framework that supports the reality of modern international relations.

 Australia has a long and proud tradition of contributing to the development of international law. This has been grounded not only in idealism but in a strong conviction that international law can and should make a realistic and relevant contribution to the regulation of international relations and the maintenance of global security.

 Testing the international legal framework

 There is no doubt that the circumstances of the post cold war environment are testing the international framework.

 Australia has consistently affirmed that any actions that are taken by this country will be consistent with international law. The question to be asked, however, is whether international law has kept pace with the changed circumstances that have evolved in the world since the end of the cold war as it relates to today’s conflicts - crimes against humanity, genocide, religious ethnic and communal conflicts, global terrorism and the like.

 These trends have challenged traditional concepts of sovereignty. They also underline that the rights that

 sovereignty conveys are accompanied by responsibilities. Sovereignty is not a blank cheque.

 I want to look at three examples: the right to intervene within a State to achieve humanitarian objectives; the status of detainees resulting from the war against terror; and the option or even responsibility to take pre-emptive actions to achieve security goals.

 Humanitarian intervention

 As I said, the first area I want to look at is the right of intervention in man-caused humanitarian crises, such as occurred in the former Yugoslavia, the genocide in Rwanda, and the collapse of the State in Somalia. In each case there was intervention by the international community using military force.

 Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter specifically vests the Security Council with the responsibility to take action and authorise the use of force. In the case of action taken by States in self-defence, Article 51 of the Charter acknowledges the right of States to defend themselves but provides the limitation ‘… until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.’

 The emphasis in the Charter is on maintaining order between states, or international security.

 It is salient in this context to note that, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), all of the 15 most deadly conflicts around the world in 2001 were intra-state conflicts. In fact, out of the 24 major armed conflicts that were under way that year only one was identified as a conflict between States - India and Pakistan.

 Of course that does not mean that these intrastate conflicts have no implications for international security. On the contrary, SIPRI found that most commonly these conflicts threatened to destabilise neighbouring states through refugee outflows, cross-border movement of combatants, and illicit flows of resources and arms.

 The proponents of a doctrine of humanitarian intervention would argue that this in itself is sufficient to justify UN involvement.

 But the birth of the UN has also seen the development of a distinct human rights regime. In addition to the expression of concern for human rights in the preamble to the Charter, the purposes of the UN include to support ‘friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self determination of peoples’ and through international co-operation ‘promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion’.

 Supporters of a modern right of humanitarian intervention traditionally cite provisions contained in Chapter IX of the Charter - which deals International Economic and Social Cooperation - as a basis for their arguments. Under Article 55, the UN is mandated to ‘promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms’. Further weight is added by the stipulation in Article 56 that all members ‘pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organisation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55.’

 But does the human rights abuse itself - that is, absent any "spillover" - pose a threat to international peace and security as would allow UN intervention using force?

 In the case of Somalia, the peace enforcement operation for humanitarian purposes was carried out under the mandate of Security Council Resolution 794. At the time, the use of a Security Council mandate for this purpose was not without controversy. It was not a conflict between States that led to the intervention but rather a total breakdown of law and order within a State that saw millions of people facing the prospect of starvation. Nevertheless, authorisation for the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) to use all necessary means to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations was provided by the Resolution.

 While the immediate humanitarian situation in Somalia was alleviated by the use of military force, the ultimate outcome of the Somali intervention was flawed. This was at least in part because the ‘day after’ role of the international community and the legal basis to reconstitute States are not clear within the conventional legal framework provided by the United Nations.

 In Rwanda the international community failed to take adequate action. The deployment of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) had been authorised by Security Council Resolution 872 but only with 250 troops.

 The shadow of Somalia, combined with a somewhat debatable political rationale that national sovereignty and non-intervention should reign supreme even in cases of complete anarchy, resulted in this extremely conservative Security Council response. The widespread genocidal killings commenced and the world community simply failed to adequately respond until a unilateral intervention by French military forces (approved by the Security Council by Resolution 929 to use "necessary means to achieve humanitarian objectives") some two months after the genocide had commenced in earnest.

 In the case of the intervention in Kosovo in 1999 there was no Security Council Resolution authorising NATO air strikes. Commenting on this aspect, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan summarised the dilemma facing the members of NATO as:

 On the one hand is it legitimate for a regional organisation to use force without a UN mandate? On the other, is it permissible to let gross and systematic violations of human rights, with grave humanitarian consequences, continue unchecked?

 The legitimacy of the NATO action has been widely debated. On 29 April 1999 Yugoslavia took the unprecedented step of commencing action in the International Court of Justice seeking provisional measures against ten NATO states. The Court was asked to order the States to ‘cease immediately [their] acts of use of force’ and to ‘refrain from any act of threat or use of force’ against Yugoslavia.

 The ICJ held that it manifestly lacked jurisdiction in two of the cases, and they were removed from the Court’s list. The Court found that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction in the remaining eight cases and therefore could not indicate such provisional measures. However, the Court also stated that it remained seized of those cases and its findings ‘in no way prejudged the question of the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the merits’ of the cases. These eight cases remain on the Court’s docket. The matter thus remains unresolved.

 Some would still argue that the sanctity of the sovereign state is such that an intervention on humanitarian grounds alone is illegal. Others would argue that, if such is the case, the legal framework for civilized behaviour across the globe has not been achieved. Most argue the intervention can be achieved within international law.

 Status of combatants

 The second issue I wanted to touch on is the status of combatants in the new post cold war conflicts.

 The war on terrorism has highlighted difficulties that are encountered with using existing legal concepts to define the status of individuals involved in unconventional warfare who may not easily fit within the previously well-defined doctrine.

 Take, for example, detainees from the conflict in Afghanistan being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

 The United States has justified the continued detention on the basis that the individuals being detained are ‘enemy combatants captured in connection with an ongoing armed conflict’ and that these persons ‘continue to pose a serious security threat to US and coalition partners’.

 The general US position in relation to the conflict in Afghanistan is that the laws of armed conflict apply. However, the US considers that the definition of persons who are entitled to prisoner of war status under the Third Geneva Convention does not include members of the Taliban. The US says the detained Taliban are enemy combatants whose unlawful actions and conduct have stripped them of Geneva Convention protection afforded privileged combatants who abide by the laws of armed conflict. Under this interpretation, the Taliban are unlawful combatants because they do not meet any of the Geneva Convention criteria for lawful combatants.

 In relation to al-Qaeda personnel, the US is of the view that the Geneva Conventions do not apply because international treaties are between state parties. Al-Qaeda is not a state and has no state authority. The US

 position is that members of al-Qaeda are not covered by the laws of armed conflict. They are not common criminals, nor can they claim to be prisoners of war. They are terrorists.

 Whilst the US argument seems logical, these issues are not beyond dispute. And those who feel threatened by terrorist attacks might argue that they cannot afford to wait for international jurisprudence to catch up with unconventional conflict.

 Conflict waged by non-state actors in unconventional form is not only posing great challenges for politicians, but for international lawyers as well.

 Self-defence and pre-emption

 The third area I wanted to look at is the right to take pre-emptive action and the limits of self-defence in a world of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.

 In other words, how relevant today are the principles defining when anticipatory force may be used in self-defence enunciated in the celebrated Caroline case (1837). For the non-lawyers, the British seized the Caroline, an American ship being used by Canadian rebels from an American port, set her on fire and sent her over Niagara Falls. This led to an exchange of diplomatic notes between the U.S and Britain.

 To justify the response in self-defence a State would have to show:

 ‘instant, overwhelming necessity’ âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» ‘leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’ âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 How should these principles be interpreted in the age of over-the-horizon weaponry, computer network attack and asymmetric threats when warning times are reduced virtually to zero and enemies can strike almost anywhere? The world in which the UN Charter was drafted was very different, with the preoccupation being to prevent the massive conventional wars between States that disfigured the first half of the twentieth century.

 It is clear that, when an armed attack against a State is imminent, that State is not compelled to wait until the first blow has been struck. But what action can a State legitimately take when that attack is to be launched by a non-State actor, in a non-conventional manner, operating from a variety of bases in disparate parts of the world? There are no tell-tale warning indicators such as the mobilisation and pre-deployment of conventional forces.

 Whilst the Charter of the U.N adopted not dissimilar language (Article 51 permits the use of self-defence "if criminal attack occurs"), it has not settled the debate between those who adopt a literal interpretation and those who argue that contemporary reality demands a more liberal interpretation.

 Again the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice does not include a definitive statement on the scope of the law of anticipatory self-defence under the Charter. States act according to their interpretation, no doubt informed by the interpretations of others.

 The clear view of the United States, promulgated in the National Security Strategy of the United States of America (September 2002), is that there is an ‘option of pre-emptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security’. The Strategy states that the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively to ‘forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries’. These clear statements by the United States reflect the view, also outlined in the Strategy, that the concept of ‘imminent threat’ must be adapted to the ‘capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries’. In short, international law cannot sit still, and the Caroline principles mentioned earlier must be adapted to the threat environment that exists today. But the U.S still couched this right as self defence rather than a distinct new doctrine.

 The same was the case in 1986 when the Reagan Administration responded to the attack in a discotheque in Berlin that killed an American soldier by bombing raids in Libya. President Reagan said the purpose of the mission was self defence and that the pre-emptive action would both diminish Colonel Qadhafi’s capacity to export terror but also provide him with reasons and incentives to change his criminal behaviour.

 Other examples include the US imposition of a maritime quarantine on Cuba in 1962 to force the USSR to remove its nuclear weapons from Cuba and - more controversially - the 1981 Israeli attack on a nuclear reactor in Iraq.

 Of course Iraq’s continuing efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction have rekindled this important debate. For the moment, the issue has been avoided by a new UN Security Council resolution ordering certain actions and warning of ‘serious consequences’ in the event of default. Hopefully Iraq can be persuaded by the consensus of the international community to disarm, and the need for armed intervention can be avoided.

 However, in the longer term the issues and the uncertainty remain unresolved.

 Some would argue that it’s time for a new and distinct doctrine of pre-emptive action to avert a threat. A better outcome might be for the international community and the international lawyers to seek an agreement on the ambit of the right to self defence better suited to contemporary realities. But in the meantime those responsible for governance will continue to interpret self-defence as necessary to protect their peoples and their nations’ interests.

 Conclusions

 A State such as ours would always claim and seek to act within the law. After all, that is one of the things that distinguishes us from the terrorists. It’s what we and our allies are fighting for.

 As there must be rules within the State for the orderly behaviour of citizens, so there must be rules between States. An increasingly inter-dependent world makes this more important than ever before.

 With it we are seeing the emergence of an international civil society, and an increasing recognition that with sovereignty must also come responsibility - towards one’s neighbours and one’s own people.

 A civilised international community will not tolerate gross abuses within States or between States.

 It will also not tolerate a State harbouring those who commit gross abuses against a third party.

 The international legal machinery is slow to adapt to these rapidly changing circumstances - but it is important that it does. It is important that international lawyers seek to catch up and ensure the international legal framework remains relevant to today’s security challenges. It would be useful if the UN contributed to the further development of these principles. Advisory opinions from the International Court of Justice might also be helpful.

 Bray would have been horrified by events of recent times - the violence and the waste. In my view he would support a just response, he would counsel respect for the law, he would interpret the law in a fair and common-sense way, and he would urge greater efforts to address injustice, inequity and intolerance.

 John Bray made a huge contribution to our society and I’m pleased we continue to honour his memory.
