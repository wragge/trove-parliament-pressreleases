 MEDIA RELEASE   

 LINDSAY TANNER MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS   

 ANOTHER ALSTON ABC ATTACK BACKFIRES   

 

 Answers to Senate Questions on Notice provide further evidence that the truth  is  of  little  concern  to  the  Howard  Government  as  it  intensifies  its  war  on  the   ABC.   

 At  Senate  Estimates  in  May,  Senator  Alston’s  attack  dog,  Senator  Santoro,   maligned  ABC  management  and  staff  with  a  series  of  provocative  questions.   Recently  released  answers  now  reveal  that  some  of  these  questions  were   based on completely untrue claims.    

 Senator  Santoro’s  claim  that  ABC  presenter  Indira  Naidoo  earned  a  salary  of   more  than  $250,000  to  $256,000  has  been  shown  to  be  completely  incorrect.   ABC  answers  show  Indira  Naidoo  earns  less  than  a  third  of  that  amount.   Senator  Santoro  should  check  his  facts  before  throwing  mud  at  decent  and   hard-working ABC presenters.   

 Senator  Santoro  alleged  that  the  ABC  has  a  relationship  with  the  Refugees   Asylum Seekers Group and that Max Uechtritz spoke at a RAM meeting. These  claims have been refuted by the ABC.   

 Senator  Santoro's  questioning  also  contained  ridiculous  accusations  that  7.30  Report  chief  political  reporters  had  “haphazard  turnover”  and  implied  that  a   Four  Corners  Program  referring  to  former  Liberal  candidate  Alan  Jones  as   “conservative” is somehow indicative of bias.    

 Senator Alston and Senator Santoro should apologise to the ABC, its staff and  viewers  for  the  outrageous  and  incorrect  slurs  made  during  Senate  Estimates.   Senator Santoro should also reveal whether these claims were provided to him  by Senator Alston’s office.   

 The  Government  is  determined  to  bully  and  starve  the  ABC  into  submission.   Senator  Santoro’s  baseless  attacks  show  that  the  truth  is  no  obstacle  in  the   Howard Government’s attempts to muzzle the ABC.
