 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 The Hon Julie Bishop MP 

 

 22 October 2014   

 

 FURTHER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ AND SYRIA   

 Today I announce that Australia will provide an additional $15 million for life-saving  assistance to people in Iraq and Syria affected by the ongoing violence perpetrated by  terrorists.   

 An estimated 16 million people inside Iraq and Syria are in need of humanitarian  assistance - half of whom have been forced to flee their homes in the face of the  onslaught of ISIL or Da’esh.   

 With winter approaching, displaced people in both countries are at risk of exposure to  harsh weather, particularly those residing in unfinished buildings, crowded camps or in  the open.   

 Australian funding will provide shelter, food and medical assistance.    

 In Iraq Australia will provide $10 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, World Food Programme and Plan International Australia.   

 This funding will include support for women and for the protection of children targeted  by terrorist organisations. This builds on Australia’s support for women and girls in Iraq  through the United Nations Population Fund.   

 In Syria, Australia will provide $5 million to the World Food Programme for the delivery  of food and to an international non-government organisation for urgent medical  assistance.   

 This funding announcement brings Australia’s total assistance for Iraq to $17 million  since June and for Syria to $135.8 million since the conflict began in 2011.
