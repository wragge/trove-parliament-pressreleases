 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today criticised the decision to incarcerate the West  Papuan asylum seekers in the Christmas Island detention centre citing it as another failure of the  Government's mandatory detention policy.    

 "The Government is already failing these people. Australia should have treated them with respect  and dignity, but instead Senator Vanstone has incarcerated them in an island prison," said  Senator Nettle.    

 "8,000 members of the Australian defence forces were stationed in the West Papuan town of  Merouke during World War II - the same town from which these people departed. The local  population supported these diggers, but this Government has failed to recognise this debt of  honour.    

 "These independence leaders have come seeking our shelter and help, but Senator Vanstone is  treating our vulnerable neighbours like criminals.   Treating refugees like criminals is wrong and the major flaw of the Government's mandatory  detention policy.    

 "The Government is trying to hide the ugliness of its detention policy. That's why it has whisked  these people off to the remote Christmas Island. They are hiding this flawed policy from the  Australian public and making it difficult for lawyers, supporters and media to help and support  these asylum seekers.    

 "Reports that Indonesian authorities were allowed access to the asylum seekers is very disturbing  and may breach the Refugee Convention.    

 "Flying the West Papuan flag as these asylum seekers did on their boat would see them  incarcerated by Indonesia for 15 years," said Senator Nettle.
