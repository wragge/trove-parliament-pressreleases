 MEDIA RELEASE

 A dozen boats as a result of coalition roadblock   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said another asylum seeker boat was intercepted today as a  consequence of the Coalition’s refusal to act in the national interest and work with the  Government to implement offshore processing.    

 The latest boat, carrying 50 asylum seekers, was the twelfth since Tony Abbott said ‘no’  to the Government’s genuine offer to compromise on the issue and work together to  prevent people from risking their lives at sea.    

 “Tony Abbott is too stubborn to admit his border protection policy is a trifecta of failure,”  Mr Bowen said.   

 “The Coalition’s turn back the boats policy is widely regarded as dangerous and  unworkable; we know offshore processing Nauru on its own won’t work as a deterrent  and it would be unlawful without legislation; while history shows Temporary Protection  Visas resulted in an increase in the number of women and children travelling to Australia  by boat.   

 “Recently, we also saw Indonesian Foreign Minister, Marty Natalegawa, describe the  Opposition’s turn backs policy as both ‘impossible’ and ‘not advisable’,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “It’s time for the Coalition to stop standing in the way of the Malaysian Agreement,” Mr  Clare said.   

 “It’s time for Tony Abbott to stop saying no and pass our legislation to allow offshore  processing in Malaysia and Nauru.”
