 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/319 WEDNESDAY 15 JUNE 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  FREE CHRISTMAS ISLAND REFUGEES FOR WORLD REFUGEE DAY In Parliament today the Australian Democrats called on the Immigration Minister to free the remaining asylum seekers detained on Christmas Island, as a fitting way to mark World Refugee Day next week. Democrat Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett also asked the Minister, Senator Vanstone, about a weekend newspaper report that a detainee was assaulted by Villawood officers and then deported before the police investigated.(1) The Minister undertook to report back once she had checked the article. In the lead up to World Refugee Day on the 20th June, Senator Bartlett renewed the Democrats' call for the Government to free remaining asylum seekers detained on Christmas Island. "Thirteen Vietnamese asylum seekers, including three children, have now been detained for nearly two years.  The Minister could save further suffering and wastage of taxpayer's dollars by using her discretion to recognise the obvious - that these people are refugees and merit protection. "Of the fifty-three Vietnamese asylum seekers who arrived in mid 2003, only thirteen have not received protection. As all of the asylum seekers come from the same group of people and have a similar claim, it is almost certain that the thirteen remaining people will, one way or another, end up recognised as refugees, as all their counterparts have been. "The Christmas Island debacle is just another example of this Government's habit of ignoring the glaring problems with their own system and ignoring all recommendations into how to fix it. "The victims are the asylum seekers and the taxpayer, as well as our tradition of due process and the rule of law," concluded Senator Bartlett  Media contact - Senator Andrew Bartlett - 0418 743 789  1) At the Mercy of Private Guards Weekend Australian, 11 June 2005.
