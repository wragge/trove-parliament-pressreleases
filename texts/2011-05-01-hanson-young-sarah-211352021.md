 Senator Sarah HansonâYoung   Australian Greens 

  

 Major parties in race to bottom on protesting asylum seekers 

 

 “The Australian Greens have rejected a proposal by the Coalition to punish asylum seekers by using  measures which will further inflame tensions within detention centres,” Greens Immigration  Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “The Greens in no way condone recent behaviour such as the destruction of buildings on Christmas  Island and at Villawood. We maintain that people accused of such acts will be dealt with by the  criminal justice system. 

 “Neither the government nor opposition are presenting any solutions to the persistent problems within  detention centres, which give rise to the frustrations of detainees. These are over crowding, the time  taken to determine applications and little information about their application’s status. 

 “This past week, the Gillard government has announced it intends bringing back temporary protection  visas in all but name. At best, Mr Morrison’s remarks today represent an attempt to return to the  punitive policies of the Howard years. We know that protests, riots, sewing of lips, suicide and self-harm occurred at detention centres during the Coalition’s term-- that’s historical fact, not our opinion. 

 “The Greens remain the only party with a long-term answer to fixing the ongoing problems within the  detention network, which would not only deal humanely with people seeking Australia’s help, but  also ensure we meet our international obligations. 

 “We have legislation before the parliament which will end mandatory detention, impost time limits  and judicial review of long-term detention and ensure all children are released. I again call on both the  government and opposition to back our measures.”
