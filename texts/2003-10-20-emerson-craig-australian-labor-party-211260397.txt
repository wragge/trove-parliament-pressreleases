 SHADOW MINISTER FOR WORKPLACE RELATIONS 

 20 October 2003   

 

 “Of hard heads and soft hearts”   

 Address to National Council of the Shop Distributive and  Allied Employees Association   

 Newcastle 

 

 One hundred and twelve years ago, striking shearers dreamed of their children  receiving a decent education.  Defeated by vicious laws, they followed their dreams  through parliamentary processes.  The fledgling Australian Labor Party inserted into  its earliest manifestos better wages and conditions for working Australians and the  public funding of education for their children.   

 Labor has never stopped dreaming.   

 We dream of a fair Australia.   

 We think of the long-term unemployed, the marginalised and the drug-addicted not as  parasites or bludgers but as the legacy of a society that has failed to provide real  opportunity.   

 And we recognise that providing opportunity is not always enough; that the  vulnerable and the marginalised often lack the self-confidence to grab opportunities  when they appear.   

 It is in these matters of the heart where Labor differs so deeply from the Coalition.   

 Labor dreams of a fair, tolerant and compassionate Australia.   

 The Howard Government relinquished any claim on compassion with its malicious  lies that asylum seekers threw their children overboard.   

  1

 How could the Howard Government lay claim to compassion when in my own  electorate a father with two sick children - one vomiting - had no choice but to turn  around and walk out of the doctor’s surgery when told he’d have to pay $40 up front  to have his children examined?   

 How could the Howard Government claim compassion when the flickering aspiration  of poor parents for a university education for their children is snuffed out by fees of  up to $100,000 or more?   

 Labor’s dream of a fair, tolerant and compassionate Australia is a dream of soft hearts  - but not bleeding hearts.   

 And if Labor’s dream is to be fulfilled we of soft hearts must have hard heads.   

 We must have hard heads that know fairness, tolerance and compassion can be  achieved out of prosperity, not stagnation.   

 Labor has long acknowledged that today’s productivity is tomorrow’s living  standards.   

 For more than seven years the Howard Government has harvested the productivity  yield from the economic reform program of the Hawke-Keating years, while  contributing precious little to the national task of ongoing productivity growth.   

 Now productivity growth has turned negative after a record-breaking decade.   

 Productivity growth might revive in fits and starts as the Australian economy  continues to absorb the productivity-boosting information technologies emanating  from the United States.     

 But the official outlook, contained in the Government’s own Intergenerational Report,  is for Australian productivity growth to slump back to its mediocre 30-year average  by the middle of the present decade.   

 Combined with the ageing of the Australian population this faltering productivity  growth is expected to cause an almost halving of Australia’s per capita GDP growth  from around 2 ½ per cent per annum during the 1990s to a little over 1 ¼ per cent per  annum from 2010 onwards.   

 This forecast slump in Australia’s per capita GDP growth from the end of this decade  onwards would constitute the slowest rate of improvement in this measure of living  standards since the 1930s.   

 Why is the Government’s official outlook for Australia’s living standards so poor?   

 The answer is the failure of the Howard Government to pursue a modern economic  reform agenda.     

 The spluttering engine of growth is the sound of the Howard Government running on  empty.

 Instead of investing in the modern sources of economic growth the Howard  Government has been content to run the economy on a housing bubble.   

 Australian households that wholly or partly own their own homes are spending up big,  going into record debt, against the paper gains on their properties.  Meanwhile, a  record low 14 per cent of home buyers are first home owners - shut out of the  Australian dream by soaring house prices.   

 The Howard Government wins the gold medal for national indebtedness, having  doubled Australia’s foreign debt to $360 billion instead of keeping its promise to fix it.     

 In fact, the Howard Government is the Mark Spitz of the debt Olympics, having  amassed six gold medals: record foreign debt, record current account deficit, record  trade deficit, record personal debt, record credit card debt and a record low household  savings ratio.   

 Bubbles have a habit of bursting.  And if - or when - the housing bubble bursts it will  whack the economy hard.   

 How can the engine of productivity growth be re-started, recognising there’s already a  huge bubble in the fuel line?     

 This is the challenge of embracing a modern reform agenda; a challenge the Howard  Government has shirked.   

 Around the world it is being recognised that the modern sources of productivity  growth are new ideas and skills.   

 But rather than investing in skills formation, the Howard Government has been  content to enter vulnerable workers into a race to the bottom, competing on wage  costs against the countries of East Asia.     

 It’s a race we should never have entered.     

 It’s a race we should never want to win.   

 The Howard Government calls this labour market flexibility.  But what it means is  flexibility downwards for vulnerable Australians.   

 It means removing the right of working Australians to bargain collectively, removing  the power of the independent umpire to settle disputes and removing any obligation  on employers to bargain in good faith.   

 That’s why locking out employees for 17 weeks or more is becoming commonplace.     

 It’s why employees are being instructed to sign individual contracts, without  negotiation, if they want to keep their jobs.     

  3

 And it’s why basic working conditions like sick pay, holiday pay and overtime  loadings are being junked through casualisation - a trend that even the Government-appointed Employment Advocate considers has gone too far.1   

 Labour market deregulation Howard-style has been used to tear away at the safety net  carefully erected by successive Labor governments and the Industrial Relations  Commission to prevent the wages and conditions of low-paid workers from falling to  the floor.     

 The Government has a bill in the parliament right now - the Orwellian titled  Protecting the Low Paid Bill - designed to make it harder for the industrial Relations  Commission to grant minimum wage rises for Australia’s lowest-paid workers.   

 In its submission opposing this bill the Australian Catholic Commission for  Employment Relations states:   

 “The payment of a just wage is not only important in maintaining the  dignity of the individual person, but also in maintaining a just socio-economic system”.   

 I have urged the new minister, Kevin Andrews, to withdraw this bill but he has refused.   

 John Howard’s re-election strategy is clear.  In the lead-up to or during the election  campaign he will reveal a new dark threat to Australia from which, he will assert,  only he can protect a frightened electorate.   

 But will he be telling the truth?  Just as at the last election, the truth may not make an  appearance until well after the votes have been counted.   

 In this re-election strategy there is no place for ideas, only fear.     

 Its strategy is to terrify people into voting Liberal.     

 It is the Liberal way.     

 They employed it in the 1966 and 1969 elections, claiming we were going to be  invaded by communists surging from Vietnam down the Malayan Peninsula into  Indonesia and onto Australia.    

 They employed it in 2001 in the aftermath of the World Trade Center bombings.  By  fingering asylum seekers as the new dark threat to Australia, Howard scared  Australians into voting Liberal again.   

 He will do it again in the 2004 election.  Substitute for asylum seekers a new terrorist  organisation, claim it is targeting Australia and worry about the truth after the  election.   

 But will the Australian people believe him again?

 Or will they see these claims of a dark new threat as a ruse to distract them from an  unsound economy, from the lack of a genuine reform agenda and from Howard’s  scalpel slicing into Australia’s public health and education systems?   

 Fear is cheaper and easier than policies.   

 That’s why the Government has no interest in new policy ideas - just the low road.   

 Skills formation under the Howard Government has been pathetic, Productivity  Commission Chairman Gary Banks observing that: “there appears to have been no  significant acceleration in workforce skills in the 1990s.  In fact, the evidence shows a  faster increase in skills in the 1980s”.2     

 After rising dramatically during the Labor period, Year 12 school retention rates have  stagnated under the Howard Government.     

 Over the 10 years to 2001-02, government spending on education fell from 4.3 per  cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent.  A small rise in private spending on education was  insufficient to prevent a national reduction in investment on education.   

 And the Howard Government has failed to support investment in new ideas.  A major  survey on R&D activity in manufacturing has revealed that only one in 25  manufacturing businesses undertakes R&D and a tiny three per cent of respondents  identified access to the R&D tax concession as the most significant factor contributing  to their R&D decision making.3   

 With the two big sources of productivity growth in a modern economy - innovation  and skills formation - being given such low priority by the Howard Government, is it  any wonder that the Government’s own Intergenerational Report paints such a bleak  picture for future growth in productivity and prosperity?   

 Labor recognises that productive and harmonious work places create prosperity - a  rich harvest that employers, employees and consumers can share.   

 Taking Labor’s high road to high skills and high wages requires a renewed  commitment to investing in skills formation through schooling, vocational education,  higher education and on-the-job training.  And it requires a strong commitment to  lifelong learning.   

 Taking this high road through education, on-the-job training and lifelong learning will  not only boost productivity it will lift labour force participation rates, countering the  ageing of the population.  It is a powerful, high-octane fuel for the engine of growth.

 Taking the high road requires a greater recognition by employers of the value of  retaining a well-trained work force.   

 And that, in turn, requires recognition of the increasingly difficult challenge facing  working Australians of balancing work and family life.   

 Proper recognition of this challenge can also contribute in some small way to slowing  the decline in Australia’s fertility rate - allowing working age Australians to be both  good employees and good parents.   

 For a while John Howard jumped on the ‘barbecue stopping’ idea of better balancing  work and family life.  He set up a Cabinet committee and after a year of due  consideration he announced that the Government’s review had concluded that “the  present policy mix is about right in providing effective choice for parents”.4   

 Labor will embrace a modern economic reform agenda of investing in the sources of  productivity growth: innovation and skills formation.   

 Australian industry will be supported through a revamped R&D program and through  extra investment in skills formation.   

 Australian industry will be supported but not John Howard’s cronies.     

 Labor will scrap the Howard Government’s secretive Strategic Investment  Coordinator process that has already dished out more than $650 million of taxpayers’  funds to companies without conducting and releasing national benefit-cost analyses of  these favoured projects.   

 Labor’s industrial relations agenda is built on four pillars: restoring the right of  working Australians to bargain collectively; re-empowering the independent umpire -  the Australian Industrial Relations Commission - to settle disputes when the parties  cannot reach agreement; preventing the use of casualisation as a means of eroding pay  and working conditions; and encouraging family-friendly workplaces that allow  working Australians to balance work and family life.   

 The first two pillars are well-established Labor policy.  The Howard Government  legislated away the right of working Australians to bargain collectively, allowing an  employer to refuse to negotiate with a trade union as the workers’ chosen  representative.     

 Labor will restore the right of Australians to bargain collectively if and where they so  desire and we will legislate to require the parties to bargain in good faith.   

 Labor will re-empower the Industrial Relations Commission, when the parties cannot  reach an agreement, to settle disputes through arbitration.     

 In Labor’s industrial relations system there will be no place for Australian Workplace  Agreements or the Office of the Employment Advocate.  We will abolish both.

 Those working Australians wishing to bargain individually will be able to do so  through common law contracts.   

 Labor’s third pillar will deal with undesirable aspects of casualisation.   

 Not all casualisation is bad or undesirable.  Casual employment may suit both  employer and employee, especially in circumstances of seasonality such as in rural,  tourism and hospitality industries.     

 But casualisation is also being used to erode pay and working conditions in pursuit of  the Howard Government’s low road to low skills and low wages.  Casual employment  is being used by businesses to under-cut rivals who provide reasonable pay, working  conditions, skills and a career path for their employees.     

 Avoiding investment in skills in a casual workforce might be short-term cost  minimisation but it is short sighted and a long-term cost to Australia.   

 I will have more to say about casualisation in coming months.  In the meantime, I  congratulate the SDA for reaching agreement with Coles and Woolworths to convert  regular casuals to part-timers.  Labor in government will encourage the spreading of  agreements like this.  And I congratulate the SDA for increasing its membership in an  environment of such hostility by the Federal Government towards union membership.    

 A series of family-friendly legislative reforms will be implemented to install the  fourth pillar of Labor’s industrial relations policy.   

 Labor will amend the public interest test in the Workplace Relations Act to require the  Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to the impact of employment  conditions on families and communities.   

 Australian mothers deserve better than John Howard.  In an indictment of the  Government’s workplace relations laws, a working mother had to pursue a case under  the Sex Discrimination Act to establish her right to part-time work after maternity  leave.   

 A federal court ruled on 6 August 2003 that the woman’s employer - ANSTO - had  discriminated against her by refusing to accommodate her reasonable request for part-time work after returning from maternity leave.   

 Labor will not oblige working mothers to pursue through the courts their claims to  part-time work upon returning from maternity leave.     

 In a family-friendly legislative reform, mothers returning to work after having a baby  will be able to request a return to work on a part-time basis and the employer will not  be able to refuse any such request unreasonably.     

 In determining reasonableness in the event of a disagreement, the Commission would  have regard to the size and nature of the workplace.

 This is light-touch regulation.  If the employer cannot reasonably accommodate the  mother’s request then the employer need only make the case.     

 The provision is meant to encourage the cultural change of greater consciousness by  employers of the challenges facing working parents in balancing work and family life.   And it is designed to encourage employers to recognise more fully the skills  embodied in working mothers by seeking to accommodate requests to return to work  on a part-time basis.   

 Labor will also change the awards system such that the Commission will be required  to ensure that awards contain effective provisions to assist workers to combine work  with family responsibilities, including provisions relating to rostering and hours of 

 work.   

 The Commission will be required specifically to examine proposed agreements in  relation to whether or not they positively assist employees to balance work with  family responsibilities.  In particular, inflexible after-hours and weekend rostering  will be held to contravene the no-disadvantage test if they could result in disadvantage  to employees with family responsibilities.   

 And, of course, Labor will fulfil its commitment to provide paid maternity leave.   

 Getting the work and family balance right is an investment in a skilled workforce and  an investment in a fairer, harmonious Australia.     

 Labor considers a skilled workforce to be an asset - not simply a cost.     

 Labor is prepared to enact light-touch regulation in these worthy pursuits, instead of  leaving industrial relations to be settled in a totally deregulated labour market.   

 Labor will withdraw working Australians from the Howard Government’s debilitating  race to the bottom with the countries of East Asia.   

 We will invest in innovation and skills formation in a new round of national  productivity growth.   

 For Labor, the high road of a skilful workforce is today’s productivity growth,  tomorrow’s prosperity and the journey to our dream of a fair, tolerant and  compassionate Australia.
