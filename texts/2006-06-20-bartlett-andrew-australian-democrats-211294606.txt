 Australian Democrats Press Releases

 On world refugee day SCRAP nauru

 The Democrats have used World Refugee Day to renew their calls on the Government to abandon its  controversial legislation which aims to force more asylum seekers offshore.   

 Democrats Deputy Leader, Senator Bartlett said, "This legislation is fundamentally flawed. It clearly  breaches our human rights obligations and repeats the same mistakes that caused such damage to the  culture of our Immigration Department."   

 "The core problem of this new Bill is that refugee assessment will be conducted outside the proper reach  of Australian law and seeks to absolve the Government of its responsibility by sending asylum seekers  to an offshore country like Nauru," said Senator Bartlett.   

 "On World Refugee Day, we should remember the two Iraqi men, found to be refugees, who are still left  languishing on Nauru due to adverse security assessments which they have been unable to appeal."   

 Senator Bartlett is the only federal politician to have visited Nauru three times to meet and speak with  detainees about their experiences.   

 "It is also appropriate today to recognise and commend the great contribution that many refugees have  made to Australia, and to acknowledge the tireless and unceasing work by refugee advocates and  organisations, and the positive changes which their efforts have achieved.
