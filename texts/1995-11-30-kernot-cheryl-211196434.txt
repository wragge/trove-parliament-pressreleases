 Senator Cheryl Kernot & Senator Sid Spindler

 Australian Democrats

 30 November. 1995 MEDIA RELEASE 951553

 Statement from Australian Democrats' Leader Senator Cheryl Kernot

 and Democrats' ethnic affairs spokesman Senator Sid Spindler in response to comments by Mr Graeme Campbell:

 While the Australian Democrats are concerned about the impact of increasing population levels on the environment, there is strong support within the Democrats for multiculturalism, as well as support for refugees and family reunions.

 We strongly condemn the racist views expressed by Graeme Campbell which were totally abhorrent and destructive to the future harmony of Australia's multicultural society.
