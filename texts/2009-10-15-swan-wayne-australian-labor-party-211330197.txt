 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW 

 BRISBANE 

 15 OCTOBER 2009 

 SUBJECTS: New housing development in Brisbane; NAB announcement to abolish  some fees; mortgage interest rates; Australian dollar; economic stimulus 

 TREASURER:  

 Look this is a very important development - it's all about jobs. But it's not just about jobs,  it's about leaving a lasting legacy for the residents of this area, because what's being  provided here is affordable housing - affordable housing for private renters and, of course,  affordable housing for those that may require social housing. So it's a very important  project. So what we've done here through economic stimulus and our housing programs is  create jobs. And of course it is projects like this that have cushioned the Australian  economy from the global recession over the past year or so. The truth is that stimulus has  kept the Australian economy growing, unlike most other advanced economies elsewhere in  the world. If it wasn't for economic stimulus the Australian economy would have went  backwards by -1.3 per cent in the year to June. Projects like this investment and essential  infrastructure have been creating jobs and leaving a lasting legacy for Australians, in this  case the affordability of housing and the increased supply of affordable housing. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Do you think it will work? Will private buyers buy into something like this, where they're  living with social housing? 

 TREASURER: 

 Look this is a fantastic model. It's got social housing and it's also got affordable rental  housing under another Commonwealth project, and it has got some units which will be sold  on the private market. This is exactly the type of project we need. And I know that the  Brisbane Housing Company is quite confident they will sell some of the units that are being  marketed privately on this site. But if you want to talk to them about that, I'd refer you to  the representative behind me here.  

 JOURNALIST:  

 Mr Swan how do you feel - NAB has announced today that it will get rid of some fees all  together - monthly fees on (inaudible)... 

 TREASURER:  

 Look, I certainly welcome the move by the NAB. I think it sort of lays down the gauntlet to  all of the other banks to reduce their fees and charges. So they've set a good example here.

 Let's see some of the others follow. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Glenn Stevens says that low interest rates might not be needed anymore; the worst may be  over. What's your comment? 

 TREASURER:  

 Well, Governor Stevens has again remarked that you couldn't say there's too much growth  in the economy. And he's also made the point that interest rates would have to move from  their fifty year emergency low. And it is the case as we move forward that there will be  movements in rates as the economy recovers, and he made that point again today. The fact  is that through both monetary policy and fiscal policy, what we are doing is putting in place  policy settings which will adjust as the economy recovers. That is how the fiscal stimulus  was designed. The fiscal stimulus is designed to gradually withdraw next year. Next year  the fiscal stimulus will detract from growth as the private sector and growth in the private  sector returns. But decisions by the Reserve Bank about the cash rate are taken  independently, but monetary policy and fiscal policy are both moving in the same direction. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Should Australians prepare for a series of rate rises then? 

 TREASURER:  

 Well that's entirely a matter for the Reserve Bank, but I think Australians understand that  interest rates couldn't stay at fifty year lows forever. The economy is beginning to recover -  that much is certain. There still is an uncertain international outlook and, of course, fiscal  policy and monetary policy are both expansionary at the moment to support jobs. Because  after all, supporting jobs is the most important thing that we can do in the middle of a  global recession which has seen unemployment go through the roof in just about every  other advanced economy in the world except Australia. And I think Australians can be  rightly proud that working together with fiscal stimulus, and with the expansion of monetary  policy, we've done something very special in this country that other countries couldn't do -  we've been able to protect our citizens and to protect our small businesses by putting in  place stimulus which has supported the economy in the face of what has been a really  savage global recession.  

 JOURNALIST:  

 What would you say to the other banks if they don't follow NAB's lead? 

 TREASURER:  

 Well, what I say to people is shop around for the best deal, and there's no doubt there is a  far better deal on fees and charges out there from one bank today. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Mr Swan on refugees, the reports of more boats coming through. Is this one of the  problems that we're facing, that we can't actually house these people if they do come? 

 TREASURER:

 Look these are operational matters. I don't speculate about the number of boats that may  or may not be out there. I think the Prime Minister today has already made some remarks  about these matters and I don't propose to make any further remarks about it. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 With the rising Aussie dollar are you concerned about the impact that it will have on  farmers, tourism and exporters? 

 TREASURER:  

 Look, I don't speculate about the path of the dollar. Treasurers simply don't do that. We do  know that a higher dollar does have an impact on farmers and exporters. We understand  that. But we've had a floating dollar in this country for a long period of time - since the early  1980's. It is one of those facts of economic life that comes in an international economy  where the exchange rate floats. But I do understand some people will do it really tough as a  consequence of a higher dollar.  

 JOURNALIST:  

 Are we seeing a false dawn in terms of recovery?  

 TREASURER:  

 I think everybody would welcome the unemployment figures that we've seen recently. We  have not recorded the huge increases that other countries have felt in this global recession,  and the reason for that has been our economic stimulus and expansionary monetary policy 

 put in place precisely at the right time to protect the Australian people from this global  recession. But as we move through to recovery, as demand in the private sector begins to  increase, of course our economic stimulus will be wound back, just as the Governor of the  Reserve Bank has indicated that interest rates can't stay at fifty year lows forever. Thanks.
