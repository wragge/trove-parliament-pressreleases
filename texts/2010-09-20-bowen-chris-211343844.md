 Chris Bowen, MP 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Federal Member for McMahon 

 Australia and Canada unite against people  smuggling  Monday, 20 September 2010 

 Regional solutions for displaced people and the shared issue of combating people  smugglers topped the agenda when the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Chris Bowen MP, met the Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and  Multiculturalism, Jason Kenney, in Canberra today. 

 ‘Canada and Australia face similar issues in terms of international displacement and  are keen to cooperate in working against people smuggling through information  sharing and other means,’ Mr Bowen said. 

 ‘The Gillard Government is committed to encouraging effective regional dialogue  among source, host and destination countries to find practical ways to provide  assistance to vulnerable people and reduce the potential for exploitation by people  smugglers.’ 

 The Federal Government believes the complex issue of irregular migration in the  region would be best addressed by a regional protection framework in South-East  Asia. 

 ‘A regional processing centre is part of a broader strategy to remove the incentive for  asylum seekers to pay people smugglers and risk their lives to come here by boat,’  Mr Bowen said. 

 ‘The establishment of a processing centre in the region would be a key component to  this regional protection framework, and would help to achieve orderly processes for  assessing refugee claims and resettling those in need of protection - consistent with  the UN Refugee Convention. 

 ‘This meeting was an excellent opportunity to discuss our proposal for a regional  protection framework and processing centre in South-East Asia with Mr Kenney.’ 

 The development of close working relationships with other countries is part of the  Federal Government's comprehensive approach to border and migration  management. 

 Mr Kenney was in Canberra following a weekend visit to Melbourne where he  inspected immigration detention facilities and met community representatives.
