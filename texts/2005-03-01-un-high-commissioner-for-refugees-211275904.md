 UNHCR: Asylum claims fall to lowest level  since 1988 

 1 March 2005

 GENEVA - The number of asylum seekers arriving in  industrialized countries fell sharply for the third year in a  row in 2004, reaching its lowest level for 16 years,  according to annual figures released by the UN refugee  agency on Tuesday.

 The total number of asylum seekers arriving last year in  the 38 industrialized countries for which comparable  historical statistics are available was the lowest since  1988, at 368,000. In the six non-European countries  included in this list, the combined total was the lowest  since 1986. The numbers arriving in Europe are also  back down to the levels of the late 1980s, although still  higher than they were for a couple of years in the mid-1990s.

 The number of asylum claims in industrialized countries  fell by 22 percent in 2004, compounding a similarly steep  decline last year. In the EU, the number fell by 19  percent, in North America by 26 percent and in Australia  and New Zealand by 28 percent.

 In most individual asylum countries, the 2004 total was  the lowest for many years. In Germany, for example, the  number is the lowest since 1984; in the U.S. and  Switzerland, the lowest since 1987; and in the  Netherlands, the lowest since 1988. And the number of  asylum seekers arriving in the U.K. is back down to the  levels of the early to mid 1990s, after plummeting 61  percent in two years.

 "This really should reduce the pressure by politicians,  media and the public to make asylum systems more and  more restrictive to the point where many genuine  refugees have enormous difficulty getting access to  Europe, or getting recognized once they are there," said  Raymond Hall, Director of UNHCR's Europe Bureau. "In  most industrialized countries it should simply not be  possible to claim there is a huge asylum crisis any  more."

 The top receiving country in 2004 was France, with an  estimated 61,600 asylum seekers. The United States,  which was top receiving country last year, came second  with 52,400. The UK fell to third with 40,200, and  Germany - the top asylum country in 13 of the past 20  years - was in fourth place with 35,600. Canada came in  fifth with 25,500.

 A very different picture emerges when the number of 

 asylum seekers is looked at relative to the size of the  hosting country (as measured by total population). Using  a per capita formula over the past five years, UNHCR  ranks Cyprus, Austria, Sweden, Luxembourg and Ireland  as the top receiving countries in the 25-member EU, with  the UK, France and Germany all coming in mid-table.

 For a few of the countries listed, including Cyprus,  Finland, the Republic of Korea, Malta, Poland and the  Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers in 2004  was the highest on record. Hidden among the general  steep fall in numbers across the industrialized world, is  the fact that the 10 new EU member states actually saw  their combined total increase by 4 percent in 2004 (and  by 18 percent in the last quarter of the year, compared  to the previous quarter).

 "Hopefully, with the numbers right down, most countries  will now be able to devote more attention to improving  the quality of their asylum systems, from the point of  view of protecting refugees, rather than just cutting  numbers," said Hall. "The EU could also take a giant step  forward by working towards a system of responsibility  and burden sharing, so that next time there is a crisis  they are in a much better position to help the worst  affected among them. Even though they are generally  much lower, the numbers are still very uneven across  the EU. We need to watch what is happening in the new  member states very carefully. Cyprus, the Slovak  Republic and Malta are all countries with young asylum  systems that are struggling to cope."

 The largest group of asylum seekers in 2004 was from  the Russian Federation (30,100), the majority of whom  are Chechens; followed by asylum seekers from Serbia  and Montenegro (22,300), many of them from Kosovo;  China (19,700); Turkey (16,200) and India (11,900).  The ten leading asylum-seeker nationalities all recorded  a significant drop in 2004. Perhaps most striking, the  number of Afghans - the top group in 2001 with more  than 50,000 asylum seekers - has fallen by 83 percent in  the past three years. They now stand in 13th place with  8,800 asylum seekers in 2004.

 "This is a clear reflection of the impact a concerted effort  to improve conditions in the region of origin can have on  the numbers seeking asylum further afield," said Hall.  "When Afghans saw things improving at home, they  started going home in big numbers instead of travelling  to Europe and beyond."

 The number of Iraqi asylum seekers has also fallen by 80  percent since 2002. However, half way through 2004 the  number of Iraqis claiming asylum started to rise again,  though not enough to lift them above ninth in the list of  asylum-seeking nationalities by the end of the year.

 All figures should be considered as provisional and  subject to change.
