 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Government should ignore Indonesian protest 

 24th Mar 06

 

 Indonesia's criticism of Australia granting asylum to West Papuan  refugees should not influence the government's responsibility to  stand up for human rights, Senator Nettle said today.   

 "The anger expressed by the Indonesian government at the decision  is acknowledgement of their failure to respect human rights in West  Papua and resolve the conflict peacefully," Senator Nettle said.   

 "The government should not use the decision to grant asylum as an  excuse to let Indonesia off the hook on its violation of human rights  in West Papua. They should not sign on to a new security treaty. 

 

 "The Greens hope that the recognition of the refugees' claim will be  a first step in Australia playing a positive role in West Papua."
