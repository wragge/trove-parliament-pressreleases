 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 500 BOAT ARRIVALS UNDER JULIA  GILLARD’S LEADERSHIP April 20, 2013

 The Prime Minister has presided over 500 illegal boat arrivals since she took over the leadership of the Labor Party,  Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection  Michael Keenan said.

 “One of the main reasons that Julia Gillard gave for outsing Kevin Rudd was his failure to protect Australia’s borders -yet  since then she has presided over the single greatest amount of illegal boat arrivals under any Australian Prime Minister,”  Mr Keenan said.

 “When the Prime Minister was the Shadow Minister for Immigration she referred to every boat arrival under the Howard  Government as a “policy failure” - well by her own standard she has presided over 500 policy failures.

 “Under this Prime Minister the Government has failed to perform one of the key duties of the Commonwealth - protecting  Australia’s borders. 

 “There have already been three times as many arrivals this year as there had been this time last year - 2013 is already  shaping up to be the biggest year for boat arrivals ever.

 “This Prime Minister’s abysmal track record on border protection has just reaffirmed that Labor does not have the will or  the resolve to tackle the people smuggling trade.

 “It takes tough but necessary policies to squash the lucrative people smugglers’ business model - the Coalition will do this  because we have done it before,” Mr Keenan said.
