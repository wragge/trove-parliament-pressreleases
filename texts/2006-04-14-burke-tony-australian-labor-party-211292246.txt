 TRANSCRIPT   

 TONY BURKE MP  Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP:  JOHN MOUNTFORD RESERVE,    NARWEE, NSW 

 

   SUBJECT:  Government’s proposed asylum seeker policy   

  Friday 14 April  2006. 

 

 

  E& OE PROOF ONLY 

 

 

 

  Tony  Burke:  Yesterday we had one of the most radical changes imaginable to   our immigration policy where the Government seriously proposed effectively   excising not one more island, but the entire of Australia from the immigration   zone.  We then find, as the details try to emerge, that Amanda Vanstone and John   Howard are saying different things.   

  Whether or not Australia could be the third country to which people end up being   sent after they have been processed off-shore Amanda Vanstone tried to deny,   only to find by the end of the day the Prime Minister acknowledging the third   country may well be Australia.  What we will end up seeing is exactly what   happened with the Pacific Solution.  We will end up in a situation where millions   and millions and millions of dollars are thrown away to other countries to do off- shore processing and the refugees will end up arriving in Australia anyway -  millions of dollars later, after their lives have been completely dislocated.   

  Labor will oppose dislocating people’s lives in this way.  Labor will oppose   effectively excising the whole of Australia from the immigration zone.  And the   motivation for this?  Well while the Prime Minister tried to claim that it wasn’t   being done in (inaudible)  to Indonesia, Amanda Vanstone gave it away when   Amanda Vanstone acknowledged this was being done because you can’t have   people turning up here with their protest signs.  She was clearly making the   argument to try to appease Indonesia.  But if you want to question whether or not   this is being done to help Jakarta or not, you only have to look at the response   from the Indonesians themselves.  Speaking on behalf of the foreign ministry, we   had yesterday, from Jakarta and I quote: “We appreciate this step from Australia   which is in response to our reaction on 42 Papuans.”   

 Our immigration policy is not being run from Canberra, it is being run from Jakarta.   Labor will never support that and we won’t support the policies that come from that  sort of motivation.  Australia’s immigration policies should take note of our 

 international responsibilities and they should be driven from our own nation.  We  have had to tolerate occasions when we have not been happy at all with the operation  of the Indonesian criminal law and we have been told from Indonesia and from  Canberra that we simply have to respect their legal system.  But the moment  Indonesia is not happy with our laws, John Howard is willing to change them.   

 Labor does not believe you should let any other country run your policies.   

 Journalist:   This is going to cost taxpayers another bucket load isn’t it (inaudible)?   

 Tony Burke:   That’s right.  The Pacific Solution since it was started has been  costing an average of three to four million dollars per month.  That’s only going to go  up if we move all the processing off-shore.  And to what end?  The same people who  John Howard said would never enter Australia’s shores are now living here.  So you  end up with the same outcome and all you do is try to appease Jakarta in the short-term.  But long-term, as long as anyone who flees Indonesia is found to be genuine, is  found to be a refugee, then a few months down the track Indonesia would have gone  full circle and Indonesia will be just as unhappy as they were a week ago.   

 Journalist:   Are you surprised the Government is going down this track when it has  recently been softening it’s immigration policies?   

 Tony Burke:   I am amazed and if they think that changes like this and policy  announcements like this are going to send a message of cultural change to the  Department they are kidding themselves.  What this sends to the Department is a  message that the culture of 2001-the year of Tampa, also the year Vivian Solon  Alvarez was deported- is the culture that they are returning to.   

 Journalist:   (inaudible)   

 Tony Burke:   It’s not a protest I will be turning up to.  Today is Good Friday and  I’m spending the day with my family.  I’m not surprised that there are going to be  protests.  The Government knew about the asbestos years ago and if they acted as  soon as they found out about it, you wouldn’t have had the mess that we’ve had in the  last week of them trying to deal with an asbestos problem that they were willing to  ignore until the media found out about it.    

 Journalist:   They are now also protesting against this new policy.   

 Tony Burke:   That’s right.  That will now be a new theme because it doesn’t take  much to realise how outrageous it is to pretend that your nation has no borders.   When John Howard first started on these policy angles some years ago about trying  to be tougher about border protection, it was about acknowledging as a nation that 

 we have borders.  Now they want to pretend that Australia is a nation with no  borders at all.     

 Journalist:   What do you think about the timing of the announcement, the day  before Good Friday, the same day that Howard fronts up to AWB?   

 Tony Burke:   It’s difficult not to be cynical.  It’s difficult to be generous with the  Government on the timing of that announcement.  The Papuans arrived at the  beginning of the year, Indonesia made their disquiet known immediately.  To leave  it right up until the day that John Howard fronts up to the AWB inquiry is a long  way from a coincidence.
