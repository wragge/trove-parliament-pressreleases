 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 Prime Minister claims new title - Kevin 107 

 Saturday 10th April 2010 

 Only hours after the Government’s announcement of a bandaid solution to the growing swell 

 in boat arrivals yesterday, another vessel was intercepted in Australian Waters, making it the 

 107th unauthorised arrival since Kevin Rudd weakened Australia’s border protection in 

 August 2008. 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said this latest 

 arrival, and with it a massive policy failure by the Government, inspired a new election 

 slogan for Labor to take to the polls - Kevin 107. 

 “Kevin Rudd rode the success of his Kevin 07 campaign at the last election - perhaps Kevin 

 107 will prove equally as catchy,” said Mr Keenan. 

 “At least under the banner Kevin 107, the Government can be honest with the Australian 

 people about their failure to secure Australia’s borders. 

 Boat ‘Kevin 107’ was intercepted yesterday evening North East of West Island, carrying 10 

 passengers. 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration Scott Morrison said Kevin Rudd’s tough talk had been 

 exposed for the lack of any real action with the arrival of boat Kevin 107. 

 “The arrival of boat Kevin 107 is the people smugglers verdict on Kevin Rudd’s political fix 

 announced yesterday rather than a genuine plan to stop the boats. 

 “This will be one of many more boats to follow which will cause the Australian government to 

 simply pay the rent longer to avoid this issue with any serious policies
