 THE HON KATE ELLIS MP 

 MINISTER FOR YOUTH 

 2020 Youth Summit 

 Launch 

 Parliament House, 12 April 2008 

 *****check against delivery***** 

 o I’m absolutely honoured to be here today to formally 

 launch the Australia 2020 Youth Summit.   o This is an historic event.   

 o Let’s make no mistake; what’s happening today is 

 breaking new ground in Australia in two fundamental  ways: Firstly, marking the new way in which we are  involving young people at the highest levels in our  nation’s policy making process. We believe that for far  too long our youth have not been empowered to speak  up and take their rightful place in public discussion.    o Secondly this weekend is ground breaking in that we are 

 embarking upon a large scale, high profile national  conversation about the country’s future that will, of  course, culminate in next weekend’s 2020 Summit. This  is exciting- you are part of forging a path to the future.   o We do not believe that young people are just “the future” 

 or “our future leaders”. We believe you should have a key  role as leaders now, shaping that future.     o Your presence here this weekend is evidence that we 

 take very seriously the involvement of young people in  public debate and decision making. But not just in debate  about “youth issues”, debate about the big issues.   o Our Government has started out as it means to go on. 

 Beginning  with the re-establishment of the youth  portfolio and the appointment of the first federal minister  for Youth in over four years, the Prime Minister made it  clear that this will be a Government that gives young  people a seat at the table, ensures that your voices are 

 heard and your issues and interests are firmly on the  agenda.   o This weekend is about harnessing the vision and ideas of 

 young Australians for a number of very powerful  reasons.     o You are here this weekend because you grew up in a 

 vastly different time to many of those currently involved in  making the decisions.   o You’ve grown up with events like 9/11; with terms like 

 'climate change' and 'terrorism'; with technologies  including the internet and mobile phones.    o We also recognize that in several areas there is a 

 substantial generational divide in opportunity. Issues  such as attaining first home ownership, the costs of  education are examples of how your experience is  different to those who came before you and we need to  see this gap reduced.   o  Because of this you have a unique grasp of the 

 challenges for a significant portion of the population both  now and into the future.   o You bring perspectives that may have been overlooked.  

 o You champion ideas that might never have surfaced.  

 o You see possibilities where others just see problems.  

 o You have a passion and determination to make sure that 

 the future will be the best possible version because you  have the most at stake in ensuring this.    o I don’t want to freak you out or anything, but you will be 

 the parents, business leaders, community leaders who  will inherit the Australia of 2020.   o As the Minister for Youth I am firmly of the belief that 

 yours is a generation that should not be expected to wait  your turn. In fact, we cannot afford for you to sit back and  wait. We need you now.    o You have spark, spunk and the sort of energy that we 

 would be mad not to harness. You want to be involved in  making a difference now.   o We’ve heard you and this is why you are here.  

 o Collectively, the delegates here are representing more 

 than one third of Australia’s population- those aged under  24.   o So in terms of numbers alone, this makes your voice 

 extremely important.   o But, more than that, you are needed to make the broader 

 2020 Summit meet its promise.  

 o In short, we need you to help make sure that Australia in 

 2020 achieves its greatest possibilities.    o I’ve heard the cynics say that what happens this 

 weekend will not be taken seriously. And let’s be honest  about this, there are those in the community, those in  business, the media, even politics who dismiss the input  and ideas of young people far too easily. There are those  who assume that because you are young you are  “lightweight”, that you can’t possibly know what you are  talking about. Others will condescend you and some will  even seek to write off the whole generation as a group of  rude, demanding partiers- a whole generation of Corey  Delaneys (dare I say it.)   o I can’t say that suddenly as a result of this weekend, you 

 will all be given the respect you deserve. But I can say  that as Youth Minister, it will be my job to push your  ideas, to give you an ongoing voice, to advocate on your  behalf, to challenge these misconceptions about you. 

 And that starts here.   o Let me reiterate the commitment of the Government that 

 your visions and ideas will be significant in the context of  next weekend’s Summit. Let me remind you that the  outcomes of this process will be documented in a  communiquÃ© and presented to each and every delegate  attending next week’s summit.   o This is not, as one journalist put to me yesterday, like 

 being invited to Christmas dinner only to find that you are  sitting at the kiddies table.   o Indeed, it is intended and expected that the energy, ideas 

 and visions generated today and tomorrow will be a  catalyst for discussions that follow.   o And the truth is that we might not agree with everything 

 that you say, but we have committed to follow up your  ideas. And when there are things we disagree with, as  there will be as an inevitable part of democracy, we will  explain why. But that certainly won’t be the end of the  conversation, we commit to continuing to work with you.     o You have the extra-ordinary opportunity to set the tone. 

 To spark off the conversation. To challenge us all into  action.   o You have the capacity to do some truly amazing things 

 here.   o But this is not just about involving you for one weekend 

 nor is it about initiating a one way conversation.  

 o This Summit is just the beginning. In fact, the Summit is 

 an opportunity for you to tell us how you think young  Australians should be engaged in the decision making  process from here on. On Sunday afternoon you will be  asked to come up with suggestions on the framework  you would like to see put in place for the Australian Youth  forum.   o This is one way that I seek to make sure that this isn’t a 

 one off- but that Australia’s young people have an  ongoing mechanism to have a meaningful relationship  with their Government. And that’s not just about just the  people in this room, but young people all around the  country.   o The 100 of you here today were chosen from many 

 outstanding applicants.   o I know from reading your biographies that in this room 

 there are young mothers, people with disabilities,  exceptionally gifted students and young carers.   o Some of you are Indigenous Australians; others 

 refugees; yet others second, third, fourth or more  generation Australians.   o There are those of different faiths.  

 o Some of you come from rural and remote Australia 

 others from our cities.   o Many have battled against considerable disadvantage 

 and life challenges to make it here. And some of you  know that you have been very fortunate in life and have  committed to help others who have not been so lucky.   o And many of you have already achieved extraordinary 

 things - representing young people at government level,  working or volunteering for great causes and  representing Australia on international delegations.   o You’ve already proven in so many ways that you are 

 articulate, intelligent, wise beyond your years and have  something powerful, inspiring and important to say about  your nation’s future.   o So, now’s your chance.  

 o Say it loud and clear.  

 o Over the next two days the nation will be listening. As 

 Youth Minister, I want you to make them take notice - by  showing them your passion, your creativity and your  insight into the world you live in. Be bold and brave,  lateral and visionary.   

 o Make sure that they are so captivated that they will stay 

 engaged, listening well beyond the duration of this  Summit.   o Remind us that it is your future that is at stake here, that 

 it is to you whom we are all ultimately accountable for the  decisions taken now.   o And most importantly, inspire in us the confidence that 

 the future is in safe hands when young heads and hearts  are involved in shaping it.   o Now, I am delighted to announce the 2020 Youth Summit 

 and through it the 2020 Summit itself, officially underway.   o Thank you- let’s do some amazing work this weekend.
