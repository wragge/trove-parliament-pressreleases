 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling SMUGGLERS SMOTHER LABOR’S HALF  HEARTED EFFORTS ON OUR BORDERS September 26, 2012

 Labor’s half hearted  solution  on our borders continues to be smothered  by the people  smugglers with  yet another boat illegally entering our waters, carrying 55 passengers, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "More  than  3,000  people  have  illegally  entered  Australia  on  boats  since  Labor  decided  to  reopen  Nauru  but  refused  to restore the other necessary and successful measures of the Howard Government," Mr Morrison said. 

 "More than 100 boats have turned up in the past 100 days, setting a new record for daily arrivals. 

 "Under the Howard Government, when the full suite of measures were in place, 16 boats turned up in 6 years. At that rate it would take more than 35 years to rack up the same number of arrivals that this Labor Government has attracted in the past 100 days. 

 "Despite continued daily arrivals, especially from Sri Lanka, where the conflict ended years ago, Labor refuses to concede the need to go further than their current half hearted approach on Nauru. 

 "Labor must stop making excuses for not restoring temporary protection visas and turning back boats where it is safe to do so. For boats coming from Sri Lanka vessels should be intercepted outside our waters and arrangements made for the safe return of the passengers by speaking to the Sri Lankan Government," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "Yet another illegal boat arrival has been intercepted, making it 4 in the last 24 hours alone â once again  proving that this Government does not have the backbone to stand up to the people smugglers. 

 "On  the  one  hand  this  Government  claims  to  be  taking  a  tougher  stance  on  border  protection,  by  reopening  offshore processing on Nauru, but on the other hand they still opt to send asylum seekers to the mainland despite them arriving after the August 14th announcement. 

 "Labor will always choose the path of least resistance when their resolve is challenged by the people smugglers. 

 "Only a Coalition Government will restore order to Australia's borders and stop the boats from coming," Mr Keenan said.
