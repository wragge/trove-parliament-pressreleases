 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR   

 TURNBULL FAILS TO INCREASE HUMANITARIAN INTAKE   

 Malcolm Turnbull’s speech to the United Nations refugee summit overnight was a  hoax.   

 Mr Turnbull has not announced an increase in the humanitarian intake to  18,750. Instead all he has done is promise not to cut the humanitarian intake his  predecessor had already committed to.   

 Smooth talk and empty promises can’t cover up the Turnbull Government’s  immigration failures.   

 Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton have failed to make any genuine steps to  increase Australia’s humanitarian intake and are returning to Australia without  securing third country resettlement options for the people on Manus and Nauru.   

 At the last election, Labor announced a commitment to double the humanitarian  intake to 27,000 by 2025 because we recognise that Australia can do more to help in  this crisis.   

 The Turnbull Government has spent the last two days lecturing the rest of the world,  but we can’t ignore that fact that they have failed to secure durable third country  settlement arrangements for refugees in the Australian-funded offshore detention  centres.   

 Peter Dutton’s failure to secure third country resettlement options has directly led to  the indefinite detention of many asylum seekers and it’s not good enough.   

 The Turnbull Government needs to immediately secure third country resettlement for  refugees in offshore detention and increase Australia’s humanitarian refugee intake.
