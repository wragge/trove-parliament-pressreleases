 East Timorese Caseload Will be Reconsidered 

 VPS 060/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, announced today that the cases of approximately 50 East Timorese asylum seekers, recently advised  that their request for Ministerial intervention had been unsuccessful, will now be reconsidered. 

 A number of the East Timorese asylum seekers have asked that their cases be reconsidered and have provided new information in support of their  claims since the time that they were advised that their request for intervention had been unsuccessful.

 In the circumstances, I have asked the Department to refer back to me all cases in which I and my predecessor declined to intervene. This is to  ensure consistency and fairness in making final decisions across the caseload.

 Each case will still be assessed on its individual merits, taking into account any countervailing considerations. 

 It is expected that applicants will be advised of the outcome of this process of reconsideration within the next two to three weeks. In the meantime,  the Department of Immigration will continue existing arrangements regarding bridging visas, work rights and access to special payments from the  Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme for those in need of such support.
