 Media Release 

 

 The Hon Tony Abbott MHR  Minister for Health and Ageing 

 Taskforce to lift private investment in  medical research  A taskforce has been formed to advise the Australian Government on ways to  encourage more investment by the private sector in Australian health and  medical research. 

 

 26 May 2005  ABB061/05   

 A taskforce has been formed to advise the Commonwealth Government on  ways to encourage more investment by the private sector in Australian health  and medical research.   

 The Private Sector Investment Taskforce will report to the government in  August on strategies to gain more support for Australian researchers from  business and philanthropic funds, both here and overseas.   

 The taskforce includes representatives from industry, the health and medical  research sector and government. It will be chaired by the Hon Jim Longley,  who brings a wealth of experience from government and industry.    

 Investment in health and medical research makes good health and economic  sense. Australia is a world leader in health and medical research - on a per  capita basis, our research output is twice the OECD average.    

 However, the Investment Review of Health and Medical Research, which  reported last December, found that while private sector investment in health  and medical research has lifted over time, Australia still has a lower share of  private investment than some other comparable countries.   

 The review, chaired by John Grant, recommended a coordinated approach to  marketing Australian research expertise to attract significant global medical  research investment.   

 The Howard Government has increased public investment in health and 

 â¢ 

 

 

 medical research to record levels, providing more than $400 million this year  through the National Health and Medical Research Council for projects in our  medical research institutes, universities and hospitals.   

 But this investment can be amplified and supported by additional funding and  involvement from the private sector. Our aim is not just for more research, but  to turn more research into practice, to provide better health outcomes for 

 Australian.   

 Details of members of the taskforce and its terms of reference are attached.

 Private Sector Investment Taskforce - Terms of  reference  The Investment Review chaired by Mr John Grant found that Australia has a  lower share of private investment in health and medical research than other  countries. Whilst the report has found that private sector investment has grown  faster than public sector investment since 1993 in Australia, it found that more  could be done to attract private investment. Section 3.4 of the Final Report  Sustaining the Virtuous Cycle for a Health, Competitive Australia specifically  refers to this issue and should provide the background to this Taskforce’s  considerations.   

 The aim of the Taskforce is to explore ways to increase investment in  Australian health and medical research through non government sources, in  particular through philanthropy, business support and research grants bodies,  nationally and internationally, with a view to improving commercialisation of  Australian research.   

 The Taskforce must report to the Minister by August 2005. The Taskforce will  draw on the consultations of the Grant Review, rather than undertake further  consultations.    

 The Taskforce is asked to consider and provide advice to the Minister for  Health and Ageing on practical strategies for the following:    

 1. Opportunities to promote Australian health and medical research  expertise and skills as a whole to philanthropic organisations both  nationally and internationally with a view to establishing mutually  beneficial funding partnerships; 

 2. How Australia might adopt a coordinated approach to corporate  funding sources (both within Australia and overseas) and to  international research funds for mutual benefit; and 

 3. Consider effective strategies to educate and support the Australian  health and medical research sector to employ international marketing  strategies.
