  PROTECTING REFUGEES

  THE REAL CHALLENGES FACING AUSTRALIA

  

  In recent weeks, much has been said about the Government’s approach 
to protecting refugee s who happen to be in Australia.

  

 However, the underlying issues are too important for 
all Australians not to look behind the publicity and allegations generated 
by individual cases to understand the real challenges facing the Government.

  

 It is easy to overlook the plight of the estimated 
22.3 million people around the world which the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) has identified as falling under its mandate. Addressing 
their problems has been a consistently high priority for successive 
Australian governments over the past fifty years.

  

 In the aftermath of World War II, the international 
community formulated a universal safety net for the neediest of the 
needy. This protection was given effect by the United Nations   1951 Refugees Convention  and its   1967 Protocol , and later conventions such as the   International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and the   Convention Against 
Torture.

  

 Through our Humanitarian Program this country has 
welcomed over 600,000 people since World War II. Australia is one of 
only seven countries worldwide that has a planned resettlement program 
for refugees and people in need of humanitarian assistance.

  

 This year we will once again provide 12,000 places 
for such individuals to settle in Australia. This commitment, on a per 
capita basis, is one of, if not the, largest in the world - around double 
that of the United States.

  

 Hand in hand with our resettlement efforts, Australia 
also recognises its responsibility to protect people within our own 
borders. However, in the late 1980s, the number of people seeking asylum 
in Australia grew rapidly from around 500 per year to around 11,000 
in 1996-97.

  

 To address this dramatic change, a substantial and 
continuing effort has been made to ensure that these claims are assessed 
quickly and thoroughly so that those found to be refugees are speedily 
granted protection.

  

 Australia’s Government has worked closely with UNHCR 
in developing and refining Australia’s refugee determination system 
and in the training of decision-makers. The UNHCR described it as “sophisticated, 
credible and fair”. It is amongst the most thorough and reliable in 
the world.

  

 To be a refugee an applicant needs only to give their 
account of their experiences and fears. Hearings are informal, interpreters 
are provided and most importantly there is no need for legal representation 
at any stage of the process.

  

 We also have in place an independent Refugee Review 
Tribunal (RRT) specifically designed to provide fair non-adversarial 
review.

  

 The reality is that there will always be genuine refugees 
coming to Australia. Equally however, there will be many who see the 
relatively low burden of proof required in refugee determination processes 
as an opportunity to gain permanent residence or an extended stay here.

  

 For many, work rights, access to Medicare, or obtaining 
Government-funded support payments while their case is assessed, offer 
prospects of financial gain far in excess of those in their home countries.

  

 Unfortunately, there are those overseas and in the 
broader Australian community who are directly contributing to and benefiting 
from this abuse of a fair and generous system. The picture painted by 
migration litigation is clear.

  

 The last four years has seen an almost 900% increase 
in appeals against RRT decisions to the Federal Court and a proliferation 
of class actions which serve to further delay the removal of large numbers 
of unlawful non-citizens.

  

 Despite some hysterical claims made and sweeping, 
but unsubstantiated, criticisms of our processes, most litigation fails 
-81 per cent in 1997-98.

  

 From the commencement of the RRT in 1993 to the end 
of 1998, this body decided 21,052 review cases. Of this number, 1,419 
applications have been made to the Federal Court to review RRT decisions. 
Tellingly, only 49 have obtained a different outcome for applicants.

  

  This clearly is not a picture of a flawed system or a system in crisis. 
It is a picture of a system performing as intended, providing non-adversarial, 
reliable and equitable refugee decisions.

  

  Unfortunately despite the implementation of the robust Immigr ation 
Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal processes, recourse to the 
courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in migration matters 
has ballooned. Over 1,000 new matters were filed in 1997-98 compared 
to 455 in 1993-94. Migration matters now make up a staggering 65% of 
the Federal Court’s administrative law caseload.

  

 Burgeoning numbers of vexatious refugee claims are 
placing a staggering burden of cost on Australian taxpayers. It is estimated 
that litigation costs will rise to $20 million by a year by 2002, with 
70% of this cost relating to asylum claimants.

  

 Additionally, running costs for the Refugee Review 
Tribunal were around $14 million in 1997-98, and in the same year $50 
million was spent locating and removing people unlawfully in Australia, 
a large number who were failed asylum claimants.

  

 When one considers that this financial year the Government 
spent $14 million directly assisting the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) in their efforts to alleviate the problems of the 
world’s refugees, it is clear our resources are not currently being 
prioritised appropriately.

  

 Class actions are also increasingly being used as 
‘weapons of delay’. There are currently 13 class/representative 
actions before the Courts involving some 5,480 persons. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that solicitors have charged each member a fee of $500 in some 
of these actions.

  

 There are reasons for such misuse of the legal system. 
In other litigation the applicant only receives an outcome from legal 
action at the determination of the matter. However, in immigration litigation 
the applicant also generates the immediate outcome of being allowed 
to remain in Australia while the action is being pursued.

  

 Australia is not alone in facing these problems. Unfortunately, 
the unlawful movement of people, their unauthorised entry, the forging 
of travel documents and disposal of identification before presenting 
to airport staff is an increasing feature of the world in which we live. 
A number of recent events in Australia amply demonstrate this.

  

 Increasingly, people are mobile. Gangs, often with 
serious criminal affiliations can organise, for a fee, to deliver somebody 
from anywhere in the world to the -Immigration Clearance line at Sydney 
International Airport.

  

 There is no shortage also of people who will coach 
these individuals along the way in the mantras which they believe might 
gain them permanent residence in this country or delay their removal. 
For many just the prospect of working here offers sufficient attraction.

  

 The challenge facing the Government is not an easy 
one. We aim to ensure that Australia in all cases meets our Convention 
obligations. Inevitably it is preferable that we err on the side of 
generosity when assessing who in this country needs our protection. 
And we do.

  

 People making application for asylum in Australia 
have a significantly higher success rate than those applying off-shore 
through the UNHCR. When you consider that this grant rate is at primary 
stage, before review, our generosity is clear.

  

 51.56% of Iraqi nationals making claims in Australia 
succeed compared to the UNHCR’s grant rate of 28.5% for Iraqi’s 
applying through Turkey and 30.80% for those applying through Jordon. 
Furthermore, Sudanese nationals have more than twice the likelihood 
of making a successful claim in Australia than they do through the UNHCR 
in Eygpt. 37.84% are granted in Australia compared to 15% in Eygpt.

  

 Beyond this I have a power to grant asylum on humanitarian 
grounds and have done so more frequently than my predecessors and beyond 
the outcomes generated by judicial action.

  

 Our onshore processes are careful but in some cases 
the protection may inevitably be given to those who do not need it. 
Every person who is not a real refugee and gains entry in this way takes 
up a place better used by a genuine refugee from one of the many trouble 
spots around the world.

  

  For these reasons the Government has presented to the Parliament the 
Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill.

  

  Contrary to recent assertions, this bill is not in breach of Australia’s 
international obligations. This bill represents a legiti mate 
and measured response to a very real problem.

  

 It is, in short, designed to restrict access to the 
courts in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances.

  

 The Judicial Review Bill aims to reduce the growing 
cost and incidence of migration litigation and the consequent delays 
in removing non-citizens with no right to remain in Australia.

  

 We need to bear in mind that much of the criticism 
about this bill comes from groups and individuals supporting those whose 
claims have failed and from others who stand to benefit, directly or 
indirectly, from an ever-expanding workload of litigation and lobbying.

  

 The Government makes no excuses for focusing Australia’s 
humanitarian intake on the genuine and most needy.

  

 We must never lose sight of the ‘faceless millions’ 
languishing in the most desperate of situations in refugee camps all 
around the world. These people are unable to pay for airline tickets 
and forged documents to travel to Australia as others do. In fact, they 
are in many cases being actively sought out for torture or murder.

  

 These people don’t attract the spotlight and media 
hype others in Australia are afforded. But they still exist, and they 
still desperately need our help.
