 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  SYDNEY   

 

 Subjects: Border protection, Coalition, stimulus package.    

 E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………...   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 The Prime Minister spent last week in parliament denying there was a problem with  people smuggling. The arrival of the sixth boat of people smugglers off Broome just  today, shows there is a real problem with the security of our borders. We have seen  six boats arrive since August, since the Government abolished temporary protection  visas. Now they were introduced in 1999 specifically for the purpose of discouraging  people smuggling. When the Government abolished these temporary protection visas  they said it would have no impact on the level of people smuggling, on this vicious  trade that puts so many human lives at risk and of course threatens the security of our  borders. We have the word of the International Organisation for Migration’s head of  mission in Indonesia that the Australian government has sent a signal to people  smugglers that it has gone soft on the security of our borders. This sixth vessel is a  long-ignored wake up call to Mr Rudd that his policy in August has been a mistake.  His greatest responsibility is to protect the security of Australia and he has sent a 

 signal to the people smugglers, these traffickers in humanity, that the Australian  commitment to secure borders has been weakened.    

 QUESTION:    

 What sort of policy would you like? How hard line should they go?    

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:    

 Well we had in place temporary protection visas which gave asylum obviously to  people who came on boats and who were able to demonstrate that they were refugees  but they were subject to review after three years and they were not, they did not give 

 the same level of certainty, if you like, or longevity, as the sort of permanent 

 protection people get who come through the normal legal channels. Now this was  done quite deliberately to discourage people smuggling. People smuggling is a  dreadful crime. Its not just a question of affecting the integrity of our borders, but it  puts many lives at risk. We don’t know how many of these vessels sink. We simply  don’t. Many of these vessels are unseaworthy. It is a very dangerous, dangerous  practice and it is something that has to be discouraged. Now we believe we had the  balance right with the temporary protection visas. The Labor Government said that  the temporary protection visas were unnecessary and by abolishing them it would  have no impact on people smuggling. Well we have seen six boats apprehended in  Australian waters since August and that surely is evidence that there has been a clear  change of heart, a change of approach on the part of this people smuggling business.  Remember, people smuggling is an industry and if they think Australia is a softer  target then they will be sending more boats our way.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Debus says it’s a seasonal thing, that they are taking advantage of the seasonal  conditions. [Inaudible] last couple of months?    

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:     

 Well I have noted what Mr Debus has said and I just simply cite the view of the head  of mission in Indonesia of the International Organisation for Migration which is an  international organisation of which most countries in the world are members and  supporters, and it is his view that there is a perception that Australia is softer on boat  arrivals, unauthorised boat arrivals, than it had been in the past and that this is  encouraging people smuggling. Now as we all know perception in this area, as in so  many others, is reality. So, we are very concerned that the Government has got this  wrong and they have to look very carefully at their policies and ask themselves wether  or not they can continue to say that the abolition of the temporary protection visas has  got nothing to do with an increase in people smuggling.    

 QUESTION:    

 Are you calling for that to be reinstated, that policy?    

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:    

 Well we believe that the temporary protection visas were a very valuable part of our  overall policy on migration and securing our borders. Governments have to review  their policies all the time to meet changed conditions. Now the Rudd government has  chosen to abandon the temporary protection visa policy. You have got the opinion of  the International Organisation for Migration that this has encouraged, sent a signal to  people smugglers that Australia is a softer target and we now have six boats found in  Australian waters since August.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Turnbull why have you rewarded Barnaby Joyce with an offer on the frontbench  when he severely embarrassed you last week? 

 

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:    

 Barnaby Joyce is the leader of The Nationals in the Senate. He has the right and  indeed it would be desirable if he were a member of the shadow cabinet. That is  perfectly standard practice. But wether he chooses to take that up  is a matter for him  and for the National Party and its leader Mr Warren Truss. But Senator Minchin who 

 is the leader of the Liberals in the Senate is of course a member of the shadow cabinet  as indeed is his deputy Senator Abetz. It is the way a Coalition works, that the leaders  of both parties are able to meet together in the shadow cabinet and make decisions  together. Now clearly it would be better if Mr Joyce were going to be part of that  leadership group. But he has chosen no to be and that is a matter that really you  should be taking up with Mr Truss.    

 QUESTION:    

 How can the Coalition function with Barnaby Joyce voting against Coalition policy?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well the Coalition is very strong and I am glad that Senator Joyce reaffirmed his  commitment to it. There will be occasions where members of the Coalition, Liberals  or Nationals, choose to vote contrary to the will or the decision of the shadow cabinet  or indeed of the collective Coalition party room. But those deviations if you like from  the collective decision have to be very few and have to be very carefully undertaken  because plainly unity is vital in politics. And Senator Joyce has said he is committed  to the Coalition. Well the Coalition requires all of us to work together as a team, and  teamwork is absolutely vital.    

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible]   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Look I am not going to say any more on that. I have made my point about the  Coalition and I have nothing more to say about Senator Joyce.    

 QUESTION:    

 The bonus payments are starting tomorrow with the stimulus package, what should  Australian families be spending their money on?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well every family will form its own judgement based on its own circumstances.  Obviously the Government would like people to spend it but clearly families will take  a prudent approach and they will be careful about how they spend their money or  indeed whether they save it or save some and spend some. It is very much a matter for  each family to decided responsibly and I have got no doubt that the vast majority of 

 Australian families will think very carefully about how they spend that money and  spend it in a prudent way that is best suited to their own particular situation.    

 QUESTION:    

 A lot of cash is obviously going to be splashing around in the economy. Do you think  that is a good thing?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well the whole purpose of this stimulus package is to encourage spending and greater  economic activity. That is the whole purpose of it.    

 QUESTION:   

 So it’s a good thing to stimulate the economy?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well every government around the world is seeking to stimulate their economies.  There is a whole range of measures that can be undertaken. In Australia we are very  fortunate to have a lot of flexibility of monetary policy, so the Reserve Bank has been 

 bringing down interest rates and I think that provides a very strong stimulus right  across the economy.
