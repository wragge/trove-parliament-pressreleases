 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ON MANUS CLOSURE    

 Serious questions have been raised following confirmation by the Turnbull  Government that Manus Island detention centre will close by October 31 and  refugees who aren’t accepted into the United States will be left behind to resettle in  Papua New Guinea.    

 Labor strongly supports the resettlement of up to 1,250 refugees from Manus Island  and Nauru in the United States but there will be potentially hundreds of refugees who  miss out and will remain in offshore processing centres.    

 Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has confirmed any refugee on Manus Island who  isn’t accepted into the United States will be left behind in PNG once the offshore  processing centre closes in October.    

 The Turnbull Government has put all their eggs in one basket with the US agreement  and failed to secure other third country resettlement arrangements; and immigration  officials confirmed last month that the Turnbull Government is not negotiating other  resettlement options.                                                                                               

 The Turnbull Government needs to clarify what the Australian Government’s role will  be in Manus Island once the offshore processing centre closes in October and what  support and assistance will be offered to refugees who are forced to remain in PNG.
