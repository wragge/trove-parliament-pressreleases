 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER  

 FA181                 10 December 2002 

 

 

 MOU ON ASYLUM SEEKERS SIGNED WITH NAURU   

 On 9 December I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Nauru’s President  Rene Harris on Cooperation in the Administration of Asylum Seekers and Related Issues.   This MOU, which replaces the one we signed on 11 December 2001, reaffirms our joint  efforts to combat people smuggling.  It will ensure our cooperation continues to the mutual  benefit of Australia and Nauru.     

 Under this MOU Nauru has agreed to accept a maximum of 1500 persons to be  accommodated at the two processing facilities in the country at any one time. Currently there  are 708 asylum seekers in the Nauru processing centres and this number is expected to decline  to approximately 300 by mid-April.   

 Australia will continue to meet all costs associated with the transfer, processing and  accommodation of the asylum seekers, in addition to meeting the operating costs of the  processing centres.  The MOU maintains existing guarantees that Australia will ensure no  persons will be left behind in Nauru.     

 The MOU also reaffirms our cooperation with Nauru on a medium-term sustainable  development strategy to assist the country in meeting its economic and development  challenges.  This is consistent with our commitment to regional security and prosperity in the  Pacific.  The strategy reflects Nauru’s development priorities, with particular focus on the  health and education sectors and infrastructure support to an estimated value of $14.5  million.    

 I was very pleased to meet again with President Harris to sign this MOU.  Australia remains  committed to working with others in the region to combat the illegal activities of people  smugglers.  Nauru, through its valuable cooperation over the last sixteen months, continues to  make a very important contribution to this end.
