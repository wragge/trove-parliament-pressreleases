 Comic book makes serious difference  to young refugees 

 19 June 2009 

 A new comic book will be an exciting and innovative settlement  tool to help refugee youth adjust to life in Australia, the  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services, Laurie Ferguson, said today.  

 The Australian Cultural Orientation Program (AUSCO) comic  book, entitled One Step at a Time, was launched today by Mr  Ferguson during Refugee Week at the Migration Museum of  South Australia. 

 ‘Academic research suggests that visual aids such as novels,  comic books and posters are a powerful yet enjoyable teaching  tool for youth and less literate people,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 ‘One Step at a Time is designed for young refugees who are  about to come to Australia. It tells the story of three refugee  families living in Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia. 

 ‘It provides an initial introduction to important elements of  Australian life such as our laws, our rights, our culture and our  government. 

 ‘It also, importantly, prepares people to travel. Even getting on an  aeroplane can be a potentially frightening experience.’ 

 Work started on the comic book in late 2007 with the help of  Multicultural Youth SA, as well as a group of young people who  had recently arrived as refugees from Africa, the Middle East and  South East Asia. 

 ‘This is a great example of one group of young refugees helping  others who will go through the same settlement experience, who  will have the same fears, the same questions and concerns,’ Mr  Ferguson said. 

 One Step at a Time will be read by refugee youth attending the  AUSCO programs overseas. 

 AUSCO is an educational program that Australia provides to  refugees and other people who have been granted visas to come  to Australia under our humanitarian program.  

 ‘During this financial year, more than 5200 people who are being  resettled in Australia have attended an AUSCO class in locations  such as Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Jordan, Kenya,  Malaysia, Nepal, Sudan, Thailand, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

 ‘It is something that Australia does well and something of which we  can all be very proud. AUSCO's new comic book will make a real  difference to people's settlement prospects,’ Mr Ferguson said.
