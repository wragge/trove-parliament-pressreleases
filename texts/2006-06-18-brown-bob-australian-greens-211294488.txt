 Howard should reverse Papua blunder 

 

 Senator Brown, 18th June 2006   

 Prime Minister John Howard should reverse the blunder of legislating for West  Papuan refugees to be banned from Australian soil, Greens Leader Bob Brown said in  Sydney today.    

 "There is no common ground between a Nauruan solution and processing refugees in  Australia. That given, the PM should look at how to allay Indonesian anxiety that  Australia will simply be a receptacle for West Papuans activists," Senator Brown said.    

 "Perhaps he should look at UN experts confirming Australia's dinkum processing of  refugees on our soil. This is not a Greens' policy, but it's a helpful suggestion for a  Prime Minister who has bungled this issue from the outset by trying to appease  Jakarta," Senator Brown said.
