 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 I’ve asked Senator Brandis to join me today, following the announcement made this  afternoon by Minister Burke. What has happened here is the government is using taxpayer  money, your money, to advertise to the vote people and not the boat people. This is a  shameless and desperate act, but before I make any further comment on that, I’ve asked  Senator Brandis if he could join me here to talk about the issues in relation to the Caretaker  Convention and then I’ll make a few further comments. Thanks, George.      

 GEORGE BRANDIS: 

 

 Thank you very much, Scott. Today the Australian Government committed an  unprecedented and flagrant breach of the Caretaker Conventions which are essential to  maintaining the integrity of Government during election periods. That breach of the  Caretaker Conventions was in relation to the Labor Party’s advertising campaign within  Australia concerning illegal boat arrivals. On the sixth of August, the Attorney General, in his  capacity as Special Minister of State, wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, asking for the  Opposition’s concurrence with the continuation of a number of government advertising  campaigns, and in his letter to Mr Abbott, he quoted the relevant section of the Caretaker  Conventions which makes it clear beyond doubt that the Opposition’s concurrence in  government advertising campaigns is required during the caretaker period for those  campaigns to continue.    

 If there were any doubt about that, Mr Dreyfus’s letter attached a schedule which listed a  number of advertising campaigns conducted by the Department of Immigration and  Citizenship, described as ‘Campaigns that may only re-commence subject to agreement  from the opposition.’  In all but one case, the opposition agreed to the continuation of those  advertising campaigns. The one advertising campaign the opposition did not agree to was  the advertising campaign by DIAC onshore, which has appeared in newspapers, radio and  television in relation to the government’s new asylum seeker policy. And the reason, which  Mr Abbott outlined in a letter to the Prime Minister, also sent on the sixth of August, is that,  in the Opposition’s view, onshore advertising cannot fairly be regarded as advertising  designed to send a message to boat people. Onshore advertising within Australia is purely a  political message.      

 Mr Dreyfus replied to Mr Abbott’s letter this morning, and in that letter, notwithstanding  that he had acknowledged that the DIAC onshore campaign could only validly be continued  with the support of the Opposition, Mr Dreyfus said that the government intends to  continue that advertising campaign notwithstanding.  This is a scandal. Never before in  Australian history, has an Australian government openly violated and trashed the Caretaker  Conventions, but by Mr Dreyfus’s own admission, by the acknowledgement in his own  correspondence with the Leader of the Opposition, that is precisely what the Government is  doing.    

 It is even more alarming that Mr Dreyfus, who is also the Attorney General, should be  sanctioning and condoning such unlawful conduct. The advertisements that the Australian  Government has been placing in Australian newspapers and in the Australian media  concerning its new offshore processing policy are nothing but political advertisements,  designed to promote the policies and the propaganda of the Australian Labor Party. The  Australian Labor Party, those advertisements should stop at once. It is unlawful for them to  continue.  If the Australian Labor Party insists on using taxpayers’ money to promote its  political agendas and its political propaganda in violation of the Caretaker Conventions, then  the Australian Labor Party should be required to pay back that money to the Australian  taxpayer.    

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 Thank you, thank you -     

 QUESTION: 

 Senator Brandis, you said that it’s law or a convention?    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:   

 The Caretaker Conventions are part of the Constitution. It is unlawful to violate them.  Now I  have copies of the correspondence which I have referred to for you, so that you can examine  for yourself the relevant portions of the correspondence. But the Caretaker Conventions have 

 been treated by both sides of politics, whoever has been in government and whoever has been  in opposition, as having the status of being part of the unwritten rules of the Constitution.    

 QUESTION:   

 Are they enforceable by law, or are there legal penalties?    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:   

 That’s something the opposition is considering, but we shouldn’t have to get to the stage in  this country, that the Australian Government and an Attorney General, who is by the way  himself a Queens Counsel, should be forced to court to obey the Caretaker Conventions. If  these advertisements are not withdrawn at once, then the Australian Labor Party should be  required to pay for them.      

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 As I said, this taxpayer funded advertising is designed to speak to vote people not boat  people. The problem here is, once again, just like Kevin Rudd, this just doesn’t pass the fair  dinkum test. This arrangement, more broadly, doesn’t pass the fair dinkum test, and we are  seeing this every single day from this Prime Minister as things continue to unravel. There is  no honest justification for the wide mainstream media spend of this government to promote  this policy. If they are to contend that they are trying to talk to a diaspora within Australia,  then there are targeted communication mechanisms they could employ, and they haven’t  done that.  They’re putting full page ads in the Sydney Morning Herald in the middle of an  election campaign using your money to do it, to talk to vote people not boat people. Now this  is a shameless act, this is a desperate act from a Prime Minister who is ram-raiding the  taxpayers’ ATM to prop up his stumbling campaign which goes from one stumble to another  stumble every single day. And here we are in Sydney, the home of New South Wales  Labor. This is New South Wales Labor 101. This is the sort of thing Eddie Obeid would be  proud of and it comes right out of the ‘Whatever it Takes’ manual. Put your hand in the  taxpayer’s pocket and pull out as much cash as you can to try and prop up your failing  campaign. The Australian people should send this government a very strong message that this  sort of thing just won’t be copped.  They've copped enough from this Government, but to be  treated in this way, so shamelessly and so bold-faced is typical of what we've seen from this  Government and they just don't get it. So it's up to the Australian people to send them that  message.     

 QUESTION:    

 There must be some merit to this campaign if they’re running it in ethnic media as well.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 Well, this is the Government that let Captain Emad come into the country and leave the  country and did nothing about it. On the eve of an election they've developed an election  conscience about the issues of people smuggling. This Government is putting full page ads in  national daily newspapers. If they wanted to talk specifically to the diaspora, with the sort of  money they're spending on this campaign, they could pay a Kevin Rudd impersonator to  deliver the message in person. That's how absurd it is to try and justify this type of activity -  this type of taxpayer funding in the middle of an election campaign. It is really quite  shameless.     

 To stop boats you need to implement policies that work, not run full page ads in national  newspapers. That's how John Howard stopped the boats, he actually implemented policies  and the fact that the Government is trying to maintain that they need the ads for the policy to  work just frankly highlights the fact that there's no substance in the policy. We've already  exposed that in the MOU that was signed. The actual ads they're running aren’t even backed  up by the agreement they've signed. This whole campaign is designed to do nothing more  than to try and convince vote people, not boat people.     

 QUESTION:    

 Would you let them run these ads in ethnic media?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 Not onshore, no.  We’re in the middle of an election campaign…    

 QUESTION:    

 Isn’t it targeted?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 No it's not targeted - that’s the point. This is not a targeted campaign. This is a shameless  grab to use taxpayers' money to grab votes off people, not to stop boat people. That's the  problem with this. It is so obvious, I think, to the Australian people that they see that this just  doesn't pass the fair dinkum test and Kevin Rudd never passes the fair dinkum test. That's  why his campaign is flailing and stumbling because he only focuses on the ads and he never  focuses on the policy. It's the policy that stops boats, not the spin of the Labor Party and a  Prime Minister addicted to that spin.     

 QUESTION:    

 Could you be specific about what targeted advertising would be acceptable?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 We're in an onshore advertising campaign they're proposing here in the middle of an election  campaign and we don't accept having an onshore campaign. The Government hasn't proposed  a targeted campaign. They haven’t proposed one at all. What they have proposed is a  multimillion dollar grab of taxpayers' funds to convince people to vote for them. That's what 

 they've done here. It is shameless, it is obvious and it just doesn't pass the fair dinkum test.  Just like the Government doesn't.    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:          

 Can I just add to that answer please, Scott? It’s very clear, from the exchange of  correspondence which I'll circulate to you, what the Opposition will agree to and what it  won't. The Government has proposed a variety of different sorts of Government advertising  in a table and the Opposition has agreed to all but one and that is the onshore campaign.  We've actually told the Government that we will concur with it continuing its offshore  campaign but the onshore campaign, for the reasons that Scott Morrison has indicated, is not  directed to boat people, it's directed to people in Australia, it is directed to voters, it is Labor  Party propaganda. So it can't be said against the Opposition that we're being deliberately  uncooperative when we've agreed to all but one of the Government's requests in relation to  the Government advertising.    

 QUESTION:    

 Senator, Minister Burke says that he doesn't need the Opposition's concurrence, only that he  needs to consult with you…    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:          

 That's incorrect because Mr Dreyfus QC, the Attorney-General in his letter to Mr Abbott on 6  August, himself acknowledged that the Opposition's concurrence was required.     

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 I note Minister Burke was out here just this week. This isn't the first time we've seen this  Minister being reckless with things that are the proper domain of the taxpayer. Just this week,  he was flailing around selected quotes of intelligence to try and prop up his own political  message in the middle of an election campaign. That is something his predecessor once  removed, Chris Bowen, never did. When he was faced with these sorts of questions following  the Malaysian people swap, Chris Bowen actually deliberately said he would not comment on  intelligence matters. So whether it's just disregarding that sort of appropriate convention and  frankly responsibility, or just putting your hand into the taxpayers' pockets to use taxpayer-funded ads to promote your political message, Minister Burke has revealed himself as  completely shameless in trying to prop up this Papua New Guinea arrangement which is  unravelling. We've had over 2,000 people who have turned up in the last three weeks at an  average of more than 100 a day. We won't know the impact, the full impact of this, one way  or the other until the other side of an election and Kevin Rudd knows that. He is asking the  Australian people to take him on trust on border protection. We won’t know the effect of this  arrangement until the other side of the election. And so he is asking to be taken on trust that  he will be able to implement it effectively. And this Government at the moment can’t even  tell you where in Papua New Guinea people will be resettled.  On what land?  With what  services?  With what benefits?  With what protections for their own safety and security living  in Papua New Guinea?  Over what period of time?   How many pensions will be paid and  what will those pensions be?  This is an offshore resettlement arrangement and there is no  offshore resettlement guidelines or any detail whatsoever.  The only thing Minister Burke  wants to do at the moment is not implement a policy and get the agreements in place that  actually give effect to resettlement, he just wants to run ads in an election campaign. And I 

 think that exposes the PNG arrangement as an election fix, not a policy designed to stop the  boats.    

 QUESTION: 

 In government will you continue the practice of informing the media every time there is a  boat arrival?      

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 These, along with all other operational considerations, would be matters for the three star  commander of that taskforce and so I’d be happy to take their advice on the release of  operational information. I think that’s the appropriate thing to do, I don’t think those  decisions should be made by politicians. I think they should be made by the appropriate  operational people who have responsibility for that. So I would be totally open to the advice  that I would take.    

 QUESTION: 

 So it might be acceptable for the public not to know whether boats have arrived?    

 SCOTT MORRISON: 

 Well as I said, that would be an operational matter that I would ask the commander to make a  decision on.  And I think it’s appropriate to take that decision out of the hands of politicians  because what we are seeing right now today is a government who is misusing taxpayers’  funds, that has misused the release selectively of intelligence to try and prop up a political  argument. Now, the Coalition will get on with the job of stopping the boats, we will have a  three star military officer to run Operation Sovereign Borders and they will be the appropriate  people, I think, to determine what information is operational sensitive or otherwise.      

 QUESTION: 

 You have used that information constantly, the information of arrivals, to promote your view  of how it should be dealt with. Why should that be removed from a potential opposition?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 Well I haven’t said that. I’ve said operational decisions on these matters of Operation  Sovereign Borders will be determined by the commander of those operations.    

 QUESTION:    

 But you haven’t said that you would be committed to ensuring information is as available as  it is now?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 I could say it five times, it’s the same answer and the answer is the commander of Operation  Sovereign borders, a three star military officer will know what information should be  released, when it should be released, how it should be released and I’m very happy to comply  with the advice that I’d be given on something as sensitive as that, as I’m sure Ministers of 

 Defence and others on operational matters take the advice of their commanders of those  operations about what information is released and isn’t released. I think you need a proper  process for releasing that information; it shouldn’t be a political tool.  This government has  released information on that at their timing, at their discretion. Boats turn up five days ago  and then the release comes out later so what I want to avoid is any suggestion along those  lines if we were to be in government and the decisions about what information we release  would be an operational matter.    

 QUESTION:    

 Senator, does it appear plausible to you that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet  would prepare legal advice saying that this is consistent with caretaker provisions?    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:    

 Well we don’t know what advice was given by the Department of Prime Minister and  Cabinet but what we do know is that the government, through its Attorney-General,  acknowledge as recently as last Tuesday that this advertising does, in order to be compliant  with the Caretaker Conventions, require the concurrence of the Opposition.      

 QUESTION:    

 And also if that advice were prepared and if it were such an egregious breach given that’s it’s  such a - that that would be a breach of the provisions, would a Coalition government take  action against lawyers inside the department if they provided that sort of faulty advice?    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:    

 Well I haven’t said that.  This is an issue about the Australian Labor party trying to use, to  gauge taxpayers’ money to fund a party political advertising campaign in the middle of an  election. That would be bad enough but the fact that it is done so in a flagrant and  acknowledged breach of the Caretaker Conventions makes it even more serious.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 But the most important action Australians can take on this today is they should register what  they feel about this with every Labor member and every Labor candidate across the country  and the best way they can register that message with them is on election day. The Labor Party  have put their hand in your pocket to talk to vote people not boat people. Now that is  shameless act, it’s an act that should not be forgiven by the Australian electorate. It’s an act  that should be punished by the Australian electorate and they’ll have the opportunity to do  that on September 7. Thanks.

 6 August 2013   

 

 The Hon Kevin Rudd MP  Prime Minister  Parliament House  CANBERRA ACT 2600   

 

 Dear Prime Minister   

 I refer to a letter from the Attorney-General dated 5 August 2013 seeking the Opposition’s  agreement under the Caretaker Conventions to permit the continuation of taxpayer funded  government advertising during the election campaign period.   

 I note that once the Writs were issued at 5.30pm yesterday and we entered the formal  Caretaker Period, all taxpayer funded government advertising should properly cease. I wrote  to the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet making it clear that the  Coalition expected proper operation of this government advertising ban.   

 I acknowledge that there is some scope for continued government advertising during the  Caretaker Period where the advertising is not contentious and the example given in the  Guidance on Caretaker Conventions 2013 refers to defence force recruitment campaigns (at  6.1.1).  However the Caretaker Conventions are explicit that advertising campaigns which  ‘address issues that are a matter of contention between the parties are normally discontinued.’  (at 6.1.1).   

 Given the nature of this request I believe it is appropriate to remind you of your own appeal  ahead of the 2007 election campaign that for “…three months prior to an election being due…  there to be a ban on publicly funded advertising unless explicitly agreed between the Leader  of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition” .  I also note that, to date, this principle  has been ignored by Labor as spending on government advertising has passed $600 million  following a sudden increase in spending over the last few months.     

 I am disappointed that you have conveniently forgotten your own 2007 election commitment  and only consulting with the Opposition now because you are legally bound to do so under  the Caretaker Conventions.   

 As you would be aware, the Opposition has been critical of taxpayer money being wasted on  highly political advertisements used only for political purposes. Table 3 of Attachment B in 

 the letter from your Special Minister of State refers to six separate and costly campaigns  which, by the his own admission, use taxpayer funds to promote contentious political issues.  As his letter indicates, a majority of all current government advertising campaigns over  $250,000 are of a contentious political nature and should not continue.     

 I note that, last month, you exempted the asylum seeker advertising campaign from the  Government’s own Guidelines on the purported basis of extreme urgency. As a result of your  decision, extensive accountability requirements for initiating information campaigns have  been nullified. Due process, including evaluation against the Guidelines and oversight by the  Independent Communications Committee to prevent misuse of public funds has been by-passed.    

 As has now become evident, the use of extreme urgency was a fiction to justify the setting  aside of the Guidelines for partisan political purposes when an election was imminent.   Taxpayer funds should not have been used for an advertisement of this type to the Australian  community to whom, in truth, these advertisements are clearly being directed. The purported  information is not extremely urgent or especially required by Australian citizens or other  lawful residents.     

 The Coalition does not stand in the way of advertising in Indonesia to stop people residing in  that country from taking a boat to Australia. In fact, we support it. We similarly support  advertising in Malaysia and other countries where people seek to take dangerous boat  journeys to Australia.   

 Accordingly, the Opposition will support the continuation of government advertising during  the Caretaker Period relating to the specific media campaigns in the Attorney-General’s letter:  tobacco use reduction, digital switchover issues, defence force recruitment, the Royal  Australian Navy Fleet Review and offshore advertising (only) targeted at asylum seekers.    

 However, we do not support the continuation of a multi-million dollar taxpayer funded  campaign aimed at Australian voters, rather than people residing overseas. If the government  wants to stop people getting on boats overseas then it should advertise overseas. But  advertising in Australia, to Australians in an election campaign is nothing more than a blatant  misuse of taxpayer money for political purposes. All asylum seeker advertising for Australian  audiences and paid for by the taxpayer is opposed and under the Caretaker Conventions must  cease immediately.    

 I have copied this letter to the Attorney-General, the Shadow Special Minister of State and the  Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to ensure it is appropriately  actioned.    

 

 Yours sincerely 

 

 TONY ABBOTT
