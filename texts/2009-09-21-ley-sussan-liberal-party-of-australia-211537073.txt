 34TH BOAT ARRIVAL PUSHES BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND TO THE  EDGE 

 The Hon Sussan Ley MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 “Enormous Customs Border Protection Command (BPC) resources are devoted to each unauthorised boat 

 interception. Home Affairs Minister Brendan O’Connor repeatedly trumpets BPC’s costly interception of these 

 unauthorised vessels, yet is doing nothing to stem the flow of asylum seekers reaching Australia,” Shadow 

 Minister for Justice and Customs Sussan Ley said today.  

 An unauthorised boat was intercepted 550 nautical miles north of Cocos-Keeling Islands. BPC assisted with the 

 search and rescue operation deploying a P-3 Orion border surveillance aircraft and the Oceanic Viking patrol 

 vessel.  

 While BPC should be commended for their efforts in yesterday’s rescue of the un-crewed vessel holding 54 

 asylum seekers, Ms Ley said “it is important to note that there are significant risks and dangers associated with 

 people smuggling, with boats often being unseaworthy and drowning not uncommon,” Ms Ley said.  

 “Unfortunately the Government’s policy encourages people to risk their lives on dangerous sea voyages, while 

 making people smugglers rich from their trade in human misery,” Ms Ley said.  

 This latest arrival brings the number of unauthorised arrivals to 1621 since the Rudd Labor Government took 

 office.  

 Meanwhile the additional $654 million Mr O’Connor says has been allocated to solve the problem will inevitably 

 lead to a reduced Customs presence at our ports and airports, exposing Australia’s frontline to the threat of 

 violence, illegal narcotics , forged passports and organised crime.  

 “Mr Rudd must launch an urgent inquiry into the relationship between their softening of border protection and the 

 surge in people smuggling in Australia,” Ms Ley said.
