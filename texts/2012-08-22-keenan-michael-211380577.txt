 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling TWO MORE BOATS ARRIVE AS LABOR  MAKES EXCUSES OVER NAURU  REOPENING August 22, 2012

 The illegal entry of two more boats, with a total of 107 people on board, shows people smugglers continue to send boats while  Labor  makes  excuses  over  reopening  the  Nauru  processing  centre,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Parliament  will  rise  tomorrow  and  the  government  has  yet  to  introduce  the  legislative  instrument  required  by  the  new laws, passed last week, to enable offshore processing on Nauru,” Mr Morrison said.

 “The  Government  demanded  the  new  laws  be  passed  last  week  and  they  were.  The  Coalition  delivered  on  our commitments  last  week  and  continue  to  stand  ready  to  act  on  our  other  commitment  to  affirm  Nauru  and  Papua  New Guinea as designated ‘regional processing countries’.

 “While  Labor  is  already  making  excuses  about  Nauru  and  has  refused  to  restore  the  full  Howard  Government  border protection measures, people smugglers continue to send boats.

 “John Howard opened the Nauru centre 19 days after announcing it. It will be ten days tomorrow since Julia Gillard made her  announcement  and  if  Nauru’s  designation  is  not  affirmed  by  the  Parliament  tomorrow,  it  will  be  at  least  another seventeen days before anyone can be sent to Nauru.

 “The legislation passed last week does not require an agreement to be in place with Nauru in order for it to be designated a ‘regional processing country’. Were such an agreement to exist, it would need to be laid before the Parliament. However the absence of an agreement is not an impediment to the designation, nor even would failure to lay an agreement before the Parliament invalidate the designation. 

 “In  these  circumstances,  we  just  need  to  get  on  with  it.  The  Coalition  is  confident  about  the  protections  that  can  be provided by Nauru as a signatory to the UN Convention and we stand ready to affirm Nauru as soon as the Minister can get the designation before the Parliament. He should do this tomorrow,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “The people smugglers continue to test the Labor Government’s resolve with another two boats carrying  over 100 people.

 “The Prime Minister had to be dragged kicking and screaming to reinstate offshore processing on Nauru and Manus after vilifying the same policy for over a decade and people smugglers understand her heart just isn’t in it. 

 “It was always naÃ¯ve to think that people smugglers were going to desist without being attacked in every possible way.

 “Yet Labor has chosen to cherry pick from the successful solution and failed to undermine people smuggling in the robust way that is required.

 “The  Government  cannot  be  trusted  to  effectively  implement  a  policy  that  they  don’t  believe  in  and  that  the  Australian   people know they don’t believe in.

 “Quite simply Labor cannot expect to see Howard Government border protection outcomes of a 99 per cent reduction in boat arrivals, without implementing the full suite of policies,” Mr Keenan said.
