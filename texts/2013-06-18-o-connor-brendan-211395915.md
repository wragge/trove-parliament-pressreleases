 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 18 June, 2013   

 COALITION CLUELESS ON CASE-BY-CASE CANCELLATIONS 

 The Coalition is in a recurring state of contradiction when it comes to explaining its cynical half-baked asylum seeker deportation plan.   

 As Coalition members use base politics to reheat interest in their four-pages of fear, they continue to  trip over critical details.   

 According to the plan, the Coalition’s key point is to automatically cancel visas.   

 KEY POINTS  ï· We will implement tough laws to automatically cancel visas held by non-citizens  who commit certain crimes punishable by more than one year in jail. 

 On launch day, Julie Bishop let slip that it would be more ‘case by case’ than ‘automatic’.   

 HUGH RIMINTON: But if you can't send them back because of international law, where are  you going to send them?    

 JULIE BISHOP: Well, in each case, we will deal with it on the circumstances of that case.  Meet the Press - Sunday, 16 June, 2013   

 Today, Scott Morrison revealed there would be nothing automatic about it all.   

 QUESTION: The Coalition says it will deport criminal refugees and the policy document says  that they can be deported for some minor public offences.  What are those minor public  offences?   

 SCOTT MORRISON: …The matters under that policy would be dealt with on a case by case  basis and those issues would be considered at the time.   

 QUESTION: It seems quite strong to be deported for a minor public order offence?   

 SCOTT MORRISON: …What we’ve said is the matter would be dealt with on a case by case  basis and there is nothing that prevents us under the Convention from deporting people in a  situation where public order or serious criminal offences are at stake.   Doors - Tuesday, 18 June, 2013   

 The Coalition’s confusion reveals what this half-baked plan actually is - the dog whistle to end all  dog whistles.   

 To make matters worse, Tony Abbott is proposing is a watering down of the current laws by  replacing a lifetime exclusion that applies to criminals removed under the Migration Act with a new  law that would allow criminals to return to Australia.
