 PM overseas worker promise rings hollow: Bandt   

 Greens Deputy Leader and workplace relations spokesperson Adam Bandt says the PM’s  promise on s457 visas rings hollow, given the failure of the government to require jobs to be  advertised locally first.   

 Allowing the big miners to use secret Enterprise Migration Agreements also showed the  Labor government wasn’t really serious about putting locals first, Mr Bandt said.   

 “The PM is ramping up the rhetoric on overseas workers to compete with Tony Abbott while  actually doing little to protect local jobs. Employers should be made to advertise locally  before they bring in overseas workers,” Mr Bandt said    

 “The changes to the 457 visa scheme are really just election window dressing. If Labor were  serious, they would bring back proper labour market testing and require jobs to be  advertised locally first.”   

 “Labor’s Enterprise Migration Agreements will also make it easier for the big miners to  import overseas workers.    

 “Like the mining tax, the tough talk hides some big loopholes.”   

 “The Greens’ Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill would  require jobs to be advertised to locals first.”   

 “The government should also be allowing the 10,000 asylum seekers living in the community  to work, strengthen skills training and make sure apprentices have a living income before  allowing more overseas workers in.”   

 “Until the Prime Minister is will to properly regulate EMAs and 457 visas her local jobs  promise will ring hollow.”
