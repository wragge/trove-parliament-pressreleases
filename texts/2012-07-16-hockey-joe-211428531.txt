 E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

 PRESENTER:

 Joining us now for their reaction are our Big Guns of Politics - Environment Minister Tony  Burke in Sydney and Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey up in Brisbane. Tony, the retail sector,  clearly struggling. There are these cuts at Myer and also the 700 jobs under threat at  Darrell Lea. What is the Government doing?

 TONY BURKE:

 I think the way Kochie framed it a few minutes ago when he went through those  unemployment figures is exactly right. What we have got at the moment is edging up from  some very good figures a few months ago, in long-term averages it is still low. But there is a  softness there at the moment and retail is feeling the brunt of it. The most important thing to  remember here at the same time, is it's more than 800,000 jobs that have been established  since we came into office. Jobs have been an absolute centrepiece of what this  government is about. But there's no doubt at all, particularly with what has happened with  the dollar, we have had an economy where some sections like the mining boom have been  absolutely going gang busters and you've had other sections like retail which have found it  much tougher and that's why we have made sure in each of the different taxation changes  we have made, particularly the mining tax, that we are spreading the benefits of the boom.  If all that revenue remains hived up in the mining sector and doesn't make its way across  the economy these sorts of challenges only get worse.

 PRESENTER:

 Let's just hope the mining sector keep their profits up. Joe, when you look at it though, and I  have just down a bit after comparison here on unemployment rates around the world, for  example, the world's strongest economy, Germany, unemployment 5.6%, United States,  8.2% Spain and Greece, of course, are absolute cot cases. But even the UK , 8.1%.  The  Prime Minister says our economy is still the envy of world leaders. According to those  figures, it probably is.

 JOE HOCKEY:

 Kochie, I was the last Coalition Minister for Workplace Relations and Employment. I left this  mob a 4% unemployment rate! The worst thing you can do is introduce new taxes.

 PRESENTER:

 Pre GFC.

 JOE HOCKEY:  Okay, so it never happened? So let's crow about a 5.2% rate or 33,000 full-time jobs being  lost last month. I can tell you, as someone who has worked in business, unlike many in the  Labor Party, I can tell you what the solution is, less tax so you don't have a carbon tax or a

 mining tax, less regulation so you don't have this complexity of the FOFA reforms on  financial advisors, stop making it harder to employ people with bad industrial laws and get  on with the job of allowing business to take risk. That's the bottom line. Business isn't going  to go out and employ more people if they feel as though there is another sledge hammer  coming their way in the form of new taxes or new regulation.

 PRESENTER:

 Speaking of those new taxes, Tony, News Limited is reporting this morning we're being hit  with a tax on a tax with power suppliers and other companies applying the GST on top of  the carbon tax. Tony, is this right? Are you double taxing us?

 TONY BURKE:

 Well, let's remember the actual impact of the carbon price. We talking about 0.7% on the  household bills.

 PRESENTER:

 We are talking about a double tax. Why should GST be applied to the impact of a carbon  tax?

 TONY BURKE:

 What we are talking about here, Kochie, is 70 cents in every $100 is your total impact.  You've got the pricing where pollution is actually occurring and then at the retail end, you  end up with a GST, but it is being blown up…[inaudible]

 PRESENTER:

 I'd rather keep my 70 cents than give it extra to you.

 TONY BURKE:

 What we are talking about, with the carbon price, the alternative is to have a situation  where pollution is free. That's the alternative.

 PRESENTER:

 Tony, the double tax is fair you are saying? That is right? We should all accept it?

 TONY BURKE:

 The mechanics of how the GST works across the entire economy have been set down for  more than a decade now.

 PRESENTER:

 So that's a yes? Okay, Joe?

 JOE HOCKEY:

 You would remember we used to have wholesale sales taxes. What we did was, we  abolished them because they were embedded taxes and when we introduced the GST, it  was meant to be at the end of the food chain, so there were no embedded taxes along the 

 way. The only area where you still have taxes on taxes is insurance - which is an insidious  area of tax. A huge percentage of what people pay in insurance goes in taxes to the State  and Federal Governments, but the best way to get efficiency in the economy is to have only

 one tax on a product, not an embedded tax and then another tax on top of it, which is what  is happening with the carbon tax.

 PRESENTER:

 Moving on now to South Korea. They have apparently assured the Foreign Minister Bob  Carr they won't go ahead with that scientific whaling program. Tony, as Environment  Minister, have you had a win?

 TONY BURKE:

 This is a massive relief this one. We were looking a week ago at the prospect of actually  going backwards on the moratorium. The position is really simple. There is nothing scientific  about harpooning a whale, chopping it up and eating it. The claim that it can be done in a 

 scientific way is rubbish and I'm really glad the Koreans have decided to not go down that  path.

 PRESENTER:

 Let's hope they can convince the Japanese to do the same. Gentlemen, thank you for that,  have a great weekend.
