 MEDIA RELEASE

 CAMBODIAN ASYLUM SEEKERS

 Delay in determining the fate of Cambodian asylum seekers will  not be in the national interest.

 Decisions will not be easy and the resource implications will  be significant.

 The Government's unwillingness to re-assign staff for urgent  case-by-case appraisal of claims both of the Chinese students  and now asylum seekers landing on our own shores will create  long-term problems for the proper handling of refugee claims.

 The principles are clear. Case-by-case determination of  individual claims can be the only just, fair and equitable  route for dealing with the individuals involved satisfying  Australia's international obligations and for the maintenance 

 of the efficacy of our immigration programme.

 People without genuine claims of a well-founded fear of  persecution should not be able to manipulate our compassion. It is unfair to all those who have a genuine entitlement. It undermines the credibility of immigration programmes 

 generally and places an unfair burden upon Australian  taxpayers.

 It is already clear that our Asian neighbours are unwilling  to provide sanctuary to Khmer boat people. This is because  there is no comprehensive plan of action likely to lead to  the resolution over the long term of the problem created by  those given temporary sanctuary.

 While the Cambodian peace initiatives are stalled, real  difficulties exist in dealing with two matters:

 (i) establishing reliable arrangements for returning those people who have no proper claim as refugees;  and

 (ii) providing an alternative but nevertheless possible  right of entry by orderly^ideparture for genuine  family reunion cases.

 These matters are dealt with in the comprehensive plan of  action for Vietnamese.

 P.T.Q.

 2

 It is clear that many of the Khmer could be mere economic  refugees. Others,.however, may be people who have suffered  political oppression under the Hun Sen Cambodian regime.

 Amnesty International has catalogued numerous on-going  breaches of fundamental human rights under the Vietnamese-  backed Communist regime.

 Some of the impetus to leave may well be provoked by the  fear in the minds of the middle class of the possible  return of Pol Pot. It should not be forgotten that it  was the educated elite which suffered most under that  oppressive regime. The memory of Pol Pot is indelibly 

 etched in the minds of all who continue to live in  Cambodia.

 These are some of the matters that would need to be properly  addressed and considered in any case-by-case examination.

 Provided the Government proceeds quickly to undertake  full and complete examination of claims on a case-by-case  basis the Opposition would have no objection to those whose  claims prove groundless being returned, assuming arrangements  are made with the Hun Sen Government to ensure they do not 

 suffer further as a result of their clandestine departure.
