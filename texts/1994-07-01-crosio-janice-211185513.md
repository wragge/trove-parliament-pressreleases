EMBARGOED UNTIL 6 JULY 1994.

 Federal Member for Prospect
Janice Crosio has announced an expansion of women's health services in
Fairfield.

 Mrs Crosio said two initiatives, jointly funded by
the Federal and State governments would improve the services available to
local women.

 As a part of the package, the Family Planning
Association Sexual and Reproductive Health Centre in Fairfield will be
expanded.

 This service seeks to increase the detection of
reproductive and sexual ill health and improve awareness of these issues
among women.

 Mrs Crosio also announced new funding for the
Fairfield Immigrant Women's Health Information Service.

 This
service, based in Barbara Street Fairfield, provides bi- lingual health
education services to immigrant and refugee women.

 "Information
on health issues can sometimes be confusing: especially if you are not
fluent in English.

 "These new initiatives will help women face
these all important health matters," Mrs Crosio said.
