 3 0  YEARS ON -  THE TASK HAS OfILY BEGUN

 REMARKS BY THE HON. J IM  CARLTON, M .P . . SHADOW TREASURER,

 AT DINNER COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF

 H IS  PRESIDENCY OF THE SYDNEY UNIVERSITY LIBERAL CLUB,

 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY. 1 1  SEPTEMBER, 1 9 8 6 .

 MR. PRESIDENT,

 THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME OF ONE OF THE MOST  

 REWARDING AND E X C ITIN G  PERIODS OF MY L IF E . 1 CAME  

 TO T H IS  UNIVERSITY IN  19 52  ON A COMMONWEALTH  

 SCHOLARSHIP. I  CAME HERE AS A PIONEER. FOR MY  

 FAMILY HAD NO BACKGROUND OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION AND  

 NO MONEY, BUT THEY GAVE ME ALL THE MORAL SUPPORT I  

 NEEDED TO TAKE UP THE STUPENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES  

 OFFERED TO SOMEONE L IK E  ME AT A PLACE L IK E  T H IS . TO  

 THE TAXPAYERS WHO MADE IT  POSSIBLE FOR ME TO COME  

 HERE, TO THE TEACHERS IN  ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE WHO  

 TAUGHT ME AND TO THE STUDENTS FROM ALL WALKS OF L IF E  

 WHO WELCOMED AND BEFRIENDED ME. I  AM TRULY GRATEFUL.

 IT  WAS HERE, IN  THE LIBERAL CLUB, THAT 1 FIR S T HELD  

 ELECTED OFFICE AS HONORARY SECRETARY AND LATER AS  

 PRESIDENT. I T  WAS HERE IN  UNION NIGHT THAT 1  

 OVERCAME MY FEAR OF SPEAKING IN  PUBLIC, IT  WAS HERE  

 THAT 1 JOINED THE UNION BOARD AND LEARNED SOMETHING  

 ABOUT HOW THINGS WERE RUN. I T  WAS HERE THAT l  WROTE

 -2 -

 ART1CLES FOR HONI S O IT , AND TOGETHER WITH ROGER  

 HATTON MANAGED THE FINANCES OF THE 19 56  REVUE, IT  

 WAS HERE THAT I REPRESENTED THE ENGINEERING FACULTY  

 ON THE S .R .C . AND WAS ELECTED S .R .C . PRESIDENT.

 FRIENDS 1 MADE THEN ARE FRIENDS S T IL L , COVERING ALL  

 FACULTIES AND ALL WALKS OF L IF E  AND VARIOUS SHADES OF  

 PO LITIC A L O P IN IO N . WHAT A FAVOURED LAND WE ARE, A  

 DEMOCRACY IN  A WORLD OF DICTATORSHIPS, OF ABUNDANCE  

 AMID POVERTY AND PHYSICAL BEAUTY AND SPACE BEYOND  

 COMPARE. BUT WHAT A RESPO N SIB ILITY WE HAVE TO MAKE  

 THE MOST OF I T .  TO BUILD ON I T ,  TO LEAVE !IT MORE  

 FREE. MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE C IV IL IS E D  THAN WE   FOUND I T .

 SO BESIDES ALLOWING MYSELF THE INDULGENCE OF WALLOWING  

 IN  NOSTALGIA T H IS  EVENING. I FELT I  OUGHT TO PASS ON  

 A FEW THOUGHTS D IS T IL L E D  FROM THE LAST 30 YEARS OF  

 THINKING ABOUT P O L IT IC S  AND ABOUT MY COUNTRY. I'V E  

 ALWAYS THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT BOTH, ESPECIALLY DURING  

 THOSE LONG PERIODS WHEN I  WAS OUTSIDE P O L IT IC S  OR  

 OUTSIDE MY COUNTRY.

 FROM ABOUT THE TIM E  1 F IR S T  CAME TO THE UNIVERSITY AT THE  

 AGE OF SIXTEEN 1 HAVE WANTED TO BE IN  P O L IT IC S , DESPITE  

 THE LOW REGARD WHICH MANY HAVE OR AFFECT TO HAVE FOR

 .../$

 I

 -3 -

 P0LIT1C 1A N S , DESPITE THE INCREASING CYNICISM ABOUT  

 P O L IT IC IA N S  THAT SEEMS TO HAVE DEVELOPED IN  RECENT  

 YEARS AND DESPITE THE EVER DEEPENING INTRUSION OF THE  

 MEDIA INTO THE PRIVATE L IV E S  OF P O L ITIC IA N S  AND THEIR  

 F A M IL IE S , I  S T IL L  REGARD P O L IT IC S  AS A NOBLE  

 PROFESSION. IT  SHOULD BE SELF EVIDENT THAT THE WORTH  

 OF A CALLING IS  DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL  

 WORTH OF ANY ONE OF IT S  PRACTITIONERS, BUT IN  T H IS  

 WORLD OF INSTANT AND SUPERFICIAL ANALYSIS THE OBVIOUS  

 NEEDS TO BE STATED. IT  FOLLOWS THAT THE PLACE OF  

 ANYONE CAPABLE AND WORTHY OF HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE  

 WILL BE TAKEN BY SOMEONE LESS CAPABLE AND LESS  

 WORTHY IF  THE FORMER DOES NOT PRESENT.

 I HOPE THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO P O L IT IC S  

 AND SENSIBLY DEVELOP YOUR TALENTS AND YOUR CAPITAL IN  

 THE OUTSIDE WORLD WILL NOT BE DIVERTED WHEN THE TIME  

 COMES FOR DEVOTING YOURSELVES TO PUBLIC SERVICE.  

 PROFESSIONAL OR COMMERCIAL L IF E  I S ,  FOR THE MOST  

 ABLE. BETTER P A ID , MORE COMFORTABLE AND MORE PRIVATE  

 THAN P O L IT IC S , BUT P O L IT IC S  CAN BE MORE SA TISFYIN G .  

 SUCCESS IN  P O L IT IC S , WHERE THE FORCES TO BE MARSHALLED  

 ARE MORE DIVERSE AND LESS CONTROLLABLE THAN ANYWHERE  

 ELSE. REQUIRES MORE DEDICATION. DETERMINATION. STAMINA  

 AND UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN NATURE THAN MOST PEOPLE  

 COMPREHEND. WHEN P O L ITIC A L ACTION IS  SUCCESSFUL IT  

 CAN HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR GENERATIONS. I

 b e u e v e  t h a t  we  a r e  on  t h e  v e r g e  o f j u s t  such  an

 OPPORTUNITY IN  AUSTRALIA NOW, AND WE ARE DETERMINED  

 TO MAKE THE MOST OF I T .  WE DARE NOT F A IL .

 THE PROCESS OF GETTING ALL THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER IN  

 P O L IT IC S  IS  RATHER L IK E  ACHIEVING THE PERFECT PRODUCTION  

 IN  OPERA, A M INO RITY SPORT IN  WHICH 1 TAKE AN INTEREST.  

 FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION OF OPERA YOU START WITH  

 THE PIECE IT S E L F , WHOSE QUALITY IS  THE PRODUCT OF  

 THE SKILLS AND C REA TIVITY OF THE COMPOSER AND L IB R E T T IS T .  

 THEN YOU TRY TO GET THE BEST ORCHESTRA, THE BEST  

 CONDUCTOR, THE BEST VOICES. T iff BEST SCENERY AND  

 COSTUME DESIGNERS. THE BEST STAGE AND LIGHTING MANAGERS,  

 AND OF COURSE THE BEST PRODUCER. ALL THESE COMPONENTS  

 HAVE THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, THEIR TEMPERAMENT,  

 AND CREATE THEIR OWN MANIFOLD PRESSURES. IF  YOU  

 HAPPEN TO BE PRESENT ON ONE OF THOSE MAGICAL OCCASIONS  

 WHEN THEY ALL COMBINE TOGETHER 111 AN OVERWHELMING  

 EXPLOSION OF B R IL L IA N C E . IT  IS  ONE OF THE MOST SUBLIME  

 OF HUMAN EXPERIENCES.

 THE F IR S T TIM E I  CAN REMEMBER T H IS  HAPPENING WAS IN  

 A PRODUCTION OF BEETHOVEN'S ONLY OPERA, F1DEL10.

 PRODUCED AND CONDUCTED AT CONVENT GARDEN BY OTTO KLEMPERER.  

 WITH JON VICKERS. SENA JUR1NAC. HANS HOTTER AND  

 GOTTLOBB FRICK IN  THE CAST. I T  WAS ON 7 MARCH, 1 9 6 1 .

 -5 -

 WHEN KLEMPERER WAS 76 YEARS OF AGE AND BADLY CRIPPLED  

 IN  BODY BUT NOT IN  M IN D . THE OPERA IS  AN ABSOLUTE  

 DOG TO PRODUCE. BUT THE MUSIC IS  SUCH AN OUTPOURING  

 OF BEETHOVEN'S GENIUS, AND THE TH IN  THEMES OF  

 CONJUGAL LOVE AND HUMAN FREEDOM SO OVERWHELMING IN  

 BEETHOVEN'S FUSION OF VOICES AND MUSIC, THAT A  

 SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION LEAVES YOU GASPING WITH EMOTION .  

 AND EXHILARATION. I CAN S T IL L  REMEMBER V IV ID L Y  THE  

 GNARLED AND CRIPPLED HANDS OF THAT OLD REFUGEE FROM  

 HITLER DRAHING OUT FROM P IT  AND STAGE BEETHOVEN'S  

 INCOMPARABLE MESSAGE OF TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN S P IR IT  

 OVER HARDSHIP AND OPPRESSION, BEETHOVEN'S MESSAGE  

 IN  F ID E L IO  IS  THE MESSAGE OF LIBERALISM .

 THOSE HHO HAVE KNOHN ME ONLY OVER THE LAST DECADE OF  

 MY P O LITIC A L THINKING OFTEN BELIEVE THAT I AM CONCERNED  

 ONLY WITH ECONOMICS. I T  IS  TRUE THAT IN  RECENT YEARS  

 l  HAVE DEVOTED MUCH MORE OF MY TIM E TO ECONOMIC ISSUES.  

 THAT IS  BECAUSE SO MANYOF OUR TROUBLES ARE ECONOMIC.

 IN  MY STUDENT DAYS WE HARDLY BOTHERED ABOUT ECONOMICS  

 AT ALL. AN EVER MORE BOUNTIFUL FUTURE WAS TAKEN FOR  

 GRANTED. NOWADAYS YOU DEVOTE MUCH MORE TIME TO IT  

 AND YOU ARE MUCH BETTER INFORMED THAN HE WERE. THAT  

 TOO IS  A SIGN OF THE PRESSURES OF THE TIM ES.

 A LIBERAL TODAY UNMINDFUL OF ECONOMICS IGNORES A  

 - «  m  ncT co M iN iN T  OF L IB E R TY . ME MUST UNDERSTAND

 -6 -

 Î¯

 ECONOMICS NOT ONLY BECAUSE ECONOMIC SUCCESS IS  

 ESSENTIAL FOR BETTERMENT OF THE HUMAN CONDITION IN  A  

 WORLD WHERE TWO THIRDS OF IT S  PEOPLE L IV E  ON THE  

 EDGE OF SUBSISTENCE, BUT BECAUSE ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS  

 INSEPARABLE FROM SOCIAL FREEDOM.

 IN  'THE ROAD TO SERFDOM' FRIEDRICH HAYEK SAYS:

 "ECONOMIC CONTROL IS  NOT MERELY CONTROL OF A  

 SECTOR OF HUMAN L IF E  WHICH CAN BE SEPARATED  

 FROM THE REST: IT  IS  THE CONTROL OF THE  

 MEANS FOR ALL OUR ENDS. AND WHOEVER HAS  

 SOLE CONTROL OF THE MEANS MUST ALSO DETERMINE  

 WHICH ENDS ARE TO BE SERVED, WHICH VALUES ARE  

 TO BE RATED HIGHER AND WHICH LOWER. IN  SHORT,  

 WHAT MEN SHOULD BELIEVE AND STRIVE FO R ,"

 SUCH A FORM OF ECONOMIC CONTROL IS  EXERCISED BY THE  

 TRADE UNION MOVEMENT USING THE CONCILIATION AND  

 ARBITRATION COMMISSION AND THE SYSTEM OF CENTRALISED  

 WAGE FIX A TIO N  AS IT S  INSTRUMENTS, THIRTY YEARS AGO  

 WE D ID  NOT SEE THE DANGER OF T H IS . WE ACCEPTED  

 WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT THE SO CALLED 'P R IN C IP L E  OF  

 COMPARATIVE WAGE J U S T IC E ', WE NOW KNOW THAT FAR  

 FROM BEING JU S T, T H IS  'P R IN C IP L E ' PENALISES THE  

 TALENTED AND THE ENERGETIC AT THE TOP END OF THE SCALE  

 BY REDUCING THEIR WAGES. PENALISES THE YOUNG. THE  

 INEXPERIENCED AND THE LEAST ABLE BY LEAVING THEM

 P f

 UNEMPLOYED AND PENALISES EVERYONE BY REDUCING  

 PRODUCTIVITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

 WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECONOMIC QUESTIONS  

 WE F A IL  TO SEE THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR  

 ORDINARY PEOPLE OF KEEPING FAILED IN STITU TIO N S IN  

 PLACE, WE F A IL  TO RECOGNISE SOME OF THE GREAT LIBERAL  

 CAUSES FOR WHICH WE MUST F IG H T . THUS ECONOMICS IS  NOT  

 DRY, DESSICATED STUFF. IT  IS  INEXTRICABLY BOUND UP  

 WITH QUESTIONS OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE AND EXPANDING  

 CHOICE, IT  IS  NO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ISSUES OVER  

 WHICH WE FOUGHT THIRTY YEARS AGO BEHIND THE  

 COMFORTABLE SHIELD OF APPARENT ECONOMIC INVULNERABILITY,  

 SUCH AS REMOVING THE.W HITE AUSTRALIA PO LIC Y,

 COLONIALISM IN  NETHERLANDS NEW GUINEA AND EGYPT'S  

 CONTROL OVER THE SUEZ CANAL.

 THE NEW INTEREST IN  ECONOMIC QUESTIONS AND  

 THE ECLIPSE OF KEYNES BY HAYEK HAVE ALSO  

 REVIVED LIBERALISM FROM THE DOLDRUMS INTO  

 WHICH IT  FELL AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH  

 CENTURY.

 ,../8

 THE LIBERAL TR A D ITIO N , WHICH IS  INSEPARABLE FROM THF  

 ADVANCE OF WESTERN CULTURE, IS  TO QUESTION THOSE  

 CUSTOMS AND RULES OF SOCIETY THAT RESTRICT INDIVIDUAL  

 FREEDOM AND EXPRESSION FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE, AND TO  

 EXPERIMENT WITH NEW LAWS OR RULES THAT ENABLE PEOPLE TO  

 FOLLOW THEIR OWN WISHES WITH DUE REGARD FOR THE WISHES  

 OF OTHERS. TH IS  DEVOTION OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE  

 LIBERAL TRADITIO N TO IND IVID U AL LIBERTY WAS REINFORCED  

 BY TWO MAJOR ECONOMIC PR IN CIPLES, THE CONCEPT OF THE  

 FREE MARKET, ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED BY ADAM SM ITH, AND  

 THE DOCTRINE OF THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY. THE  

 GRADUAL REMOVAL OF DESPOTISM, THE DEVELOPMENT OF  

 CONSTITUTIONAL LIM ITA TIO N S  ON GOVERNMENT, THE EXTENSION  

 OF THE FRANCHISE, THE SPREAD OF EDUCATION AND THE  

 BUILD-UP OF. WEALTH THROUGH INDUSTRIALISATION WERE THE  

 GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS OF 1RTH AND 19TII CENTURY LIBERALISM .

 IN  THE TWENTIETH CENTURY LIBERALISM LOST ITS WAY,  

 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ITS FAILURE TO TACKLE EFFECTIVELY  

 THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTIO N OF WEALTH IN  THE COMMUNITY.  

 INSTEAD OF RE-READING ADAM SMITH AND DOING SOME  

 CHARACTERISTICALLY LIBERAL TINKERING WITH IN S TITU TIO N S ,  

 LIBERALS EITHER BECAME SO C IA LISTS, OR, WHILE S T IL L  

 NOMINALLY SUBSCRIBING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, PLACED

 EXCESSIVE FAITH IN  THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENT TO  

 INTERVENE TO CORRECT SOCIAL IL L S . THIS LATTER  

 DIVERSION LED TO THE CORRUPTION OF THE WORD 'L IB E R A L '

 IN AMERICA TO DENOTE THOSE WITH INTERVENTIONIST  

 TENDENCIES. IT  IS  UNFORTUNATE THAT WORDS LIKE  

 'NEO-CONSERVATIVE' HAVE HAD TO BE USED TO DESCRIBE  

 MODERN DAY AMERICANS FOLLOWING THE CLASSICAL LIBERAL  

 TR A DITIO N.

 I AM GLAD MENZIES STUCK TO THE WORD 'L IR E R A L ' WHEN HE  

 ESTABLISHED OUR PARTY AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR.

 YEARS LATER HE RECALLED:

 'WE TOOK THE NAME 'L IB E R A L ' BECAUSE WE WERE  

 DETERMINED TO BE A PROGRESSIVE PARTY, WILLING TO  

 MAKE EXPERIMENTS, IN  NO SENSE REACTIONARY BUT  

 BELIEVING IN  THE IN D IV ID U A L , H IS RIGHTS, AND HIS  

 ENTERPRISE, AND REJECTING THE SOC1LALIST PANACEA·'

 WHEN MENZIES RETIRED IN  1966 PUBLIC SECTOR OUTLAYS WERE  

 31 PERCENT OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. NOW THEY ARE A3  

 PERCENT. ARE WE 12 PERCENT HAPPIER? I  DOUBT THAT WE  

 HAVE RECEIVED VALUE FOR MONEY. WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN  

 DISTORTING THE SIGNALS OF THE MARKETPLACE, AND TOO FAR

 10

 IN  RELIEVING PEOPLE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL  

 R E S P O N S IB IL IT IE S - NEW AREAS OF REPRESSION AND DENIAL  

 OF LIBERTY AND CHOICE HAVE EMERGED. GOVERNMENTS AND  

 UNIONS HAVE OVERTAKEN BUSINESS AS THE OVER-POWERFUL  

 IN STITU TIO NS THAT MUST RE OUR TARGETS FOR REFORM. A  

 TAXATION AND SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM THAT TAKES *1 0 0  A  

 WEEK IN  TAX OUT OF THE $400 PAY PACKET OF A PERSON  

 SUPPORTING A FAMILY AND PAYS *8 8  A WEEK OF IT  IN  

 UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT TO AN 18 YEAR OLD L IV IN G  AT HOME  

 WITHOUT APPLYING EITHER A FAMILY MEANS TEST OR AN  

 EFFECTIVE WORK TEST CRIES OUT FOR LIBERAL REFORM. IT  

 IS  GROSSLY UNFAIR AND WOULD SHOCK THE 19TH CENTURY  

 REFORMERS WHO FOUGHT FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR THE FAMILY.

 OR, TAKE THE OUESTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT. OVER 20 PERCENT  

 OF OUR YOUTH ARE UNEMPLOYED. IS  IT  SURPRISING, WHEN  

 * 8 8  A WEEK IS  READILY AVAILABLE FOR NO WORK, AND IT  IS  

 ILLEGAL FOR AN EMPLOYER TO EMPLOY 18 YEAR OLD SHOP  

 ASSISTANTS FOR LESS THAN $ 1 8 8 , REGARDLESS OF HOW  

 INEXPERIENCED THEY ARE? IS  IT  A JUST, LIBERAL SOCIETY  

 THAT PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR YOUTH NOT TO WORK AND  

 MAKES IT  ILLEGAL FOR AN EMPLOYER TO EMPLOY A YOUTH AT  

 AN ECONOMIC WAGE? NO WONDER THAT YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT  

 HAS RISEN FROM 51 IN  1973 TO 221 TODAY I CAN YOU  

 IMAGINE THE SHEER WASTE OF HUMAN RESOURCES, THE  

 PERSONAL DEGRADATION AND WIDESPREAD SOCIAL DESTRUCTION  

 THAT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL TH IS  PROBLEM IS  SOLVED?

 11

 I HOPE I HAVE CONVINCED YOU THAT AT LEAST A PASSING  

 UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECONOMY IS  A NECESSARY, THOUGH NOT  

 SUFFICIENT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN  THE ARMOURY OF THE  

 MODERN LIBERAL. ADAM SMITH TOLD US ABOUT I T ,  BUT WE  

 FORGOT. FR1EDRICK HA YEN HAS REMINDED IIS . TODAY'S  

 SOCIAL PROBLEMS DEMAND IT  OF US. ECONOMIC  

 UNDERSTANDING IS  A MEANS, NOT AN END, AND TO DECRY ITS  

 USE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT S  U T IL IT Y  IS  IRRESPONSIBLE,  

 AN IR R ESPO N SIB ILITY THAT CAN BE MEASURED IN  LOSS OF  

 FREEDOM AND INHUMAN SUFFERING- IGNORANCE IN  

 PO LITIC IA N S DOES NOT PRODUCE BLISS FOR THE MASSES.

 NOW MORE THAN EVER THERE IS  A NEED FOR P O L ITIC IA N S  TO  

 ANALYSE FIRST AND TRADE OFF SECOND. THE NATURAL  

 INSTINCT OF THE P O L IT IC IA N  IS  TO REACT TO THE POLITICAL  

 SITUATION BEFORE UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM. PO LITICS  

 INVOLVES COMPROMISE, WE KNOW THAT. BUT TO COMPROMISE  

 BEFORE YOU HAVE ANALYSED, BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT THE  

 IDEAL SOLUTION SHOULD BE, IS  A DERELICTION OF DUTY.  

 OFTEN ONCE YOU KNOW THE IDEAL SOLUTION YOU CAN CREATE  

 THE PO LITICAL CLIMATE FOR IT S  ACCEPTANCE. TO ATTEMPT  

 LESS IS TO F A IL  IN  YOUR PROFESSIONAL R ESPO N SIB ILITY.

 YOU BECOME A MERE CORK BOBBING IN  THE WAVES CREATED BY  

 INTEREST GROUPS.

 12.

 THE FINAL POINT I WOULD LIKE TO HAKE IS  THE QUESTION Of  

 IMPLEMENTATION. IN  THE VALDER REPORT. WHICH WE WROTE  

 AFTER OUR DEFEAT IN  1 9 8 3 , WE PUT AT THE HEAD OF CHAPTER  

 9 , ENTITLED 'THE PARTY IN  GOVERNMENT' AN IMAGINED QUOTE  

 FROM THE HONOURABLE JAMES HACKER, M .P .:

 'WHAT ON EARTH IS  THE USE OF SPENDING 30 YEARS  

 DEVELOPING A PO LITICAL PHILOSPHY, THREE YEARS IN  

 OPPOSITION DEVELOPING PO LICIES AND THEN COMING INTO  

 OFFICE AND HANDING THE WHOLE THING OVER TO SIR  

 HUMPHREY?'

 WHEN I LEFT T H IS  UNIVERSITY I SPENT THE NEXT IS  YEARS  

 OF MY L IF E  LEARNING AS MUCH AS I COULD ABOUT  

 MANAGEMENT, BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT THE PO LITICS OF THE  

 FUTURE WOULD BE SHAPED BY OUR CAPACITY TO CONTROL THE  

 COLOSSUS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR. NOW THAT WE ARE  

 DETERMINED TO TRIM THE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF THAT  

 COLOSSUS, THE NEED FOR MANAGEMENT SKILLS BECOMES EVEN  

 GREATER. SO THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN  A POLITICAL  

 CAREER, MOST CERTAINLY DEVELOP YOUR PERSONAL POLITICAL  

 PHILOSOPHY, YOUR V IS IO N  OF THE WORLD AS IT  SHOULD RE­

 DEVELOP ALSO YOUR POLICY PROPOSALS· BUT REMEMBER THAT  

 YOUR FINEST IDEAS ARE BUT GRAINS OF SAND ON BONDI BEACH

 Î¯ Î¯

 1J.

 IF  YOU DO NOT WORK OUT HON TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE.  

 IMPLEMENTATION IS  THE MOST NEGLECTED COMPONENT OF  

 EFFECTIVE P O L IT IC S . INCREASINGLY IT  MILL BECOME THE  

 POLITICAL BATTLEGROUND OF THE FUTURE. YOU HAVE THE  

 CHANCE TO GAIN THE HIGH GROUND.

 YOU PROBABLY CAME HERE TH IS EVENING EXPECTING SOMETHING  

 MORE IN  THE WAY OF ENTERTAINMENT, BUT 1 DO NOT  

 APOLOGISE FOR BEING SERIOUS- 1 FIRMLY B ELIE V E , JUST AS  

 I DID  AS A STUDENT THIRTY YEARS AGO, THAT THE LIBERAL  

 TRADITION APPLIED TO CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS IS  S TILL THE  

 BEST GUIDE TO CREATING THE C IV IL IS E D , TOLERANT AND  

 PROSPEROUS SOCIETY THAT HOST OF US WANT.

 DOMESTICALLY THE LIBERAL AGENDA IS  CROWDED. TODAY WE  

 LOST OUR INTERNATIONAL AAA CREDIT RATING, A NATIONAL  

 DISGRACE. WE ARE SLIPPING BACK IN  OUR REGION. ME ARE  

 FA ILIN G  OUR YOUTH. OUR GERIATRIC SOCIAL INSTITUTIO NS  

 REQUIRE FAR REACHING REHABILITATIO N. WE NEED TO REGAIN  

 OUR SELF RESPECT AS A RESULT OF WHAT HE ACHIEVE, NOT BY  

 PAYING ADVERTISING AGENTS TO WRITE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE  

 TO BELIEVE.

 INTERNATIONALLY WE FIND TO OUR DISMAY THAT VERY FEW OF  

 THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD SUBSCRIBE TO LIBERAL VALUES.  

 THE TWIN E V IL S  OF TOTALITARIANISM AND ABJECT POVERTY  

 DENY A MAJORITY OF THOSE ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE THE  

 ESSENTIAL FREEDOMS AND THE BASIC TOOLS OF SURVIVAL-  

 ADDED TO TH IS  WE L IV E  UNDER THE CONSTANT THREAT OF  

 ANNIHILATIO N THROUGH NUCLEAR WAR.

 THE LIBERAL TASK IS  THEREFORE URGENT AND THE STEPS ARE  

 MANY. IT 'S  AN EXCITING  CHALLENGE- L E T 'S  HAVE ANOTHER  

 LOOK IN  10 YEARS' TIME AND SEE HOW FAR WE'VE GOT.
