 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 More boats the consequence of Abbott inaction  Saturday, 02 June 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. 

 Another asylum seeker boat arrived today, the 41st since Tony Abbott's negativity  dismissed offers of compromise from the government to stop the flow of boats and  people risking their lives at sea. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the Coalition needed to accept that their actions  had very negative consequences. 

 'The consequence of the Tony Abbott's refusal to support the government's offshore  processing legislation - including an offer to re-establish a centre on Nauru - is more  boat arrivals,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'By voting 'no' in the Parliament last week, by playing politics with an issue that is in  the national interest, the Coalition is ensuring there is no deterrent in place to  prevent people from risking their lives on leaky boats. 

 'They are playing right into the hands of people smugglers, and they know it.' 

 Mr Clare said it was time Tony Abbott stopped saying no and voted to allow offshore  processing in Malaysia and Nauru. 

 'Let's remember what this is all about - 200 people died off the coast of Indonesia  and another 11 died off the coast of Malaysia,' Mr Clare said. 

 'Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing.'
