  Dems: Court ignorant and confused about refugee 
system

  

  The Australian Democrats have condemned comments made today by Wes tern 
Australia Premier Richard Court, about refugees.

  

 “Premier Court doesn’t seem to understand the 
difference between an illegal immigrant and a refugee. Illegal immigrants 
do not get access to welfare, as Mr Court has claimed,” said Senator 
Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

  

 “Court clearly has no idea of the facts and is irresponsibly 
peddling yet more immigration myths.”

  

 Richard Court is reported as saying, ‘If you come 
into this country illegally you shouldn’t get the time of day.’

  

 “If a few thousand Jewish refugees had escaped Nazi 
Germany and made their way by boat to Australia without permission, 
presumably Richard Court would want them turned around and sent back. 
By his definition they would be illegal immigrants, not refugees,” 
said Senator Bartlett.

  

 “The Iraqi refugees who originally entered Australia 
illegally are still genuine refugees, which means they would face persecution, 
torture or death if returned.

  

 “Refugee status is rigorously tested by Australian 
authorities. Those who are not genuine refugees are not allowed to stay. 
Those who are found to be genuine refugees are allowed to stay on a 
three year visa and are given absolutely basic income support,” he 
said.

  

 Under new Government regulations, which the Democrats 
opposed, these refugees have only three year visas, they have limited 
access to social security benefits, education or even housing. They 
know their families will not be able to join them and are probably in 
danger.

  

  “Government action should focus on pr eventing people-smuggling 
schemes while recognising that for some refugees, such as those from 
Iraq or Afghanistan, it is extremely difficult to apply for refugee 
status through legal channels.”

  

 “I hope West Australians will show them more compassion 
than Premier Court has,” he concluded.
