 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1094 THURSDAY 25 NOVEMBER 2004   SENATOR NATASHA STOTT DESPOJA AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA URGENT ACTION ON BAXTER NEEDED The Australian Democrats today expressed their deep concern at reports of a spate of suicide attempts in the Baxter Detention Centre. It has been reported that five asylum seekers have recently tried to kill themselves, including one man who attempted suicide by inserting wires into the electrical outlet in his room. Democrats’ Senator for South Australia Natasha Stott Despoja said today she was appalled at the despair our detention centres are inflicting on asylum seekers. “These people, who in many cases have survived torture, war and the loss of family members, have shown great resilience and courage in arriving in Australia.   “It is an indictment on our mandatory detention system that their sanity is now being pushed to the limit by the country in which they sought asylum. "When I visited Baxter in July, I was profoundly disturbed by the asylum seeker's reports of their lives in detention and my first hand view of the conditions in this isolated desert detention centre. “I am also greatly concerned about the latest allegations against GSL management and the distribution of medication to asylum seekers.” Refugee advocates have reported that medication is only being made available once a day, outside of the compound, with some asylum seekers being forced to wait hours for their medication.  It has also been reported that detainees are being denied privacy regarding their medical needs, due to the constant presence of officers. “When detainees are obviously suffering severe mental health problems as a result of their detention, such treatment of their medical needs is unconscionable,” Senator Stott Despoja said. “These reports reinforce the absolute necessity of reforming our immigration system. The Democrats will pursue this issue with the Minister for Immigration by asking her to investigate these allegations and intervene to ensure the asylum seekers are treated humanely and with dignity.” Media contact - Raina Hunter - 0402 145 820
