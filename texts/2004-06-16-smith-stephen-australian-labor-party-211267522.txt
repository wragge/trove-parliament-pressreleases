 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, WEDNESDAY, 16  JUNE 2004   

 SUBJECT: NAURU HUNGER STRIKE, BAKHTIARI FAMILY, AGED CARE  ACCOMMODATION BONDS, ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS, SEX SLAVE TRADE   

 SMITH:  Well a couple of immigration and aged care matters this morning.     

 Firstly the Nauru hunger strike.  The Government has confirmed there are three Iraqis on  hunger strike, they’re drinking water but not taking any food.  I again urge the  Government to ensure that all necessary medical resources and facilities are made  available.  Let’s hope that they learn from the mistakes they made earlier in the year.  

 

 Secondly on immigration, freedom of information information obtained by ABC  Adelaide and released last night shows that the cost of keeping Mrs Bakhtiari in a motel  in Adelaide for 8 to 9 months before she was re-united with her five children has cost the 

 Australian taxpayer over $700,000.     

 There’s no reason that I’m aware of on the public record why Mrs Bakhtiari could not  have been re-united with her children in community care 8 to 9 months ago.  The  Government has recently decided to re-unite her with her five children.  That’s at a cost 

 of over $700,000.  That’s the equivalent of over 3,000 bulk billed GP consultations per  month.   

 On aged care, last night in the House the Government voted down an amendment that I  proposed to the Aged Care Act to restrict accommodation bonds to low level residential  aged care.     

 This gives the lie to the Government’s pretence that it doesn’t want to extend  accommodation bonds.  That’s been their commitment and policy approach since 1997.     

 The Government is refusing to be open and honest with the Australian public about their  intentions.  When you read the fine-print of the Budget Papers, when you read the fine-

 print of the Government’s response to the Hogan Review, they clearly want to extend  accommodation bonds.    Last night on any number of occasions, the Minister again failed or refused to rule out the 

 extension of accommodation bonds to the Government’s proposed new medium care  level for residential accommodation.     

 So the Government should be up-front.  They’re being completely disingenuous here,  trying to slide through and if re-elected they will extend accommodation bonds, despite  the fact they’re now pretending to the contrary.   

 REPORTER: On another matter the Government looks to have approved even tougher  counter-terrorism laws including longer interrogation periods.  Is this a Government  going too far?   

 SMITH: I’m going to have to leave that to my colleague Robert McClelland, Shadow  Minister for Homeland Security.  I suspect he’ll be dealing with the detail of those  matters, so I’ll have to leave it to him.   

 REPORTER:  And the Bakhtiaris, why does it take an FOI request to get this  information.  Why couldn’t Labor tease this out at Estimates?   

 SMITH:  Well, we have been teasing a whole range of information out at Estimates  about the cost of some of the Government’s manoeuvres in this area.  We concentrated on  the Pacific Solution and you would have seen the details we teased out there - $250,000  per month for Manus Island.   

 

 I’m quite happy, I must say, for our independent national public broadcaster to pursue  these matters.  In the event, the information that was actually released was agreed  between the Government and the ABC Adelaide.  All that was handed over was the  actual bottom-line cost of $80,000 per month or $720,000 over 9 months.  So I’m not  proposing, and I don’t think you’re suggesting, that the ABC should restrain itself in  these matters pending Senate Estimates.     

 The information was released yesterday.  I simply make the point, that on the public  record, there’s no reason to me, that I can see, why Mrs Bakhtiari couldn’t have been re-united with her children 8 to 9 months ago.  The Government made that decision recently 

 and the cost of keeping Mrs Bakhtiari in a motel in Adelaide, both pregnant and then with  her newly born child, has been the equivalent of over 3,000 bulk billed GP consultations  per month.   

 REPORTER:  What’s your reaction to US State Department listing Australia as a  country of destination for sex slaves?   

 SMITH:  Again, technically it’s a matter for Robert McClelland, but I’m happy to make  a couple of comments.  You’d remember that in 2002 and 2003 Labor was making the 

 point that we weren’t doing enough, and that’s the bottom line analysis of the report that  you see today.     

 At our urgings in 2003, the Government provided the Australian Federal Police with $20  million for a taskforce.  My own view is that’s not enough.     

 We’ve also been making the point that the Government’s Ambassador for People  Smuggling should have the sex trade and the sex slave trade added to her ambit.  So there  is more that the Government can be doing.  It’s an issue which doesn’t receive enough  attention.  We made the point in 2002 when we released part of our immigration policy 

 that more work needed to be done.     

 As I say, technically it’s a matter for Robert McClelland, but the $20m to Australian  Federal Police is not enough.  It should be added to the ambit of the Ambassador for  People Smuggling, and the Government does need to do more.   

 Ends.
