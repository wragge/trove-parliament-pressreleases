 Australian Law Reform Commission Conference Managing Justice: the way ahead for civil disputes  Regent Hotel, Sydney 9:00am, Friday 19 May 2000

  

 Introduction 1. I am pleased to give the opening address to this important conference. First, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Australian Law Reform Commission on its 25th anniversary and to all those who have worked with the Commission over the past 25 years.

 2. The Commission was established with bipartisan support. It began work on January 1, 1975, around the same time as other institutional bases of the federal justice system: the Federal Court, the Family Court, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Ombudsman.

 3. Many distinguished lawyers have been Presidents and Commissioners. They include: two High Court judges, Justice Kirby and former Chief Justice Brennan; the present Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court, Justice Spigelman; and several Federal and Family Court Judges, including Justices Wilcox, von Doussa, Coleman and Weinberg.

 Law reform 4. Throughout its 25 year history, the Commission has provided leadership and expertise in law reform. It has established itself as the nation’s premier law reform body, pursuing uniformity of law with a particular focus on federal laws and matters involving federal jurisdiction.

 5. Its work has played a significant role in the evolution of Australian law, a role as integral as the enactment of legislation and the development of the common law by the courts. .

 6. Judicial law-making has been described correctly as ‘opportunistic’. This is in the sense that "a court can make law only when a case raising the relevant issue presents itself". 1 Judicial law-making "is the by-product of the primary function of the Court, the resolution of disputes’’.2

 7. Rather than evaluating the law according to the case before it, the Commission acts on references which are invariably matters of contemporary concern. It has the time and resources to conduct research on the impact of laws on the community and the likely impact of changes to the law. It also seeks submissions from experts and the people affected, and occasionally carries out joint research with other bodies. 3

 Business response 8. The Commission’s 64 substantive reports, in areas as diverse as human tissue transplants and legal risk in international transactions, have contributed significantly to the development and modernisation of the statute books. The Privacy Act; the Insurance Contracts Act; the various insolvency provisions of Commonwealth laws; and the provisions for class actions in the Federal Court of Australia Act, are a small sample of significant legislative changes that have their genesis in the work of the Commission.

 9. The Commission’s reports have also played an important role in promoting common rules and procedures across State and Commonwealth legal systems. For example, the Commission’s report and draft legislation which was the basis of the Commonwealth Evidence Act4 provided a model for the States and Territories. The Act has been adopted in NSW and it is expected that it will also be enacted in Tasmania soon.

 10. Another good example is the revised Service and Execution of Process Act, which provides for the national enforcement of orders and judgments of State courts and tribunals.

 The Government's objective for the civil justice system

 11. The Government’s overall objective for the civil justice system is to ensure that the delivery of justice is timely, efficient and cost effective. We also want to ensure that the civil justice system produces fair and just outcomes.

 12. That is why I consider the Commission’s latest review of the federal civil justice system, Managing Justice, one of the most important it has undertaken.

 13. The Government is actively considering the report. I have referred recommendations on particular issues to the relevant bodies or Ministers responsible for those issues. We will respond to the recommendations requiring Commonwealth action following consultations.

 14. I am pleased that the report has given the civil justice system a relatively clean bill of health. However, the Commission’s report spells out clearly how we can achieve a better system.

 15. I should point out that it is not just the civil justice system that can be improved. I have also initiated, through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, a process for bringing reform to the criminal justice process.

 16. Providing an efficient court system that has the confidence of the community is a central thrust of Government law reforms.

 Justice should not be delayed by outdated rules and procedures used only out of pure habit. Neither should court procedures exist simply to suit the convenience of the legal profession.

 17. Reforming the rules requires hard, committed work. However, the rules by which they operate must consistently be reviewed and reformed in order that they remain relevant.

 18. The movement for procedural reform has been growing, both in Australian and overseas. 5

 19. It is a movement the Government encourages. We are keen to provide a legislative framework that encourages effective and efficient rules of practice and procedure in the federal courts.

 Federal Magistrates Service

 20. Indeed, the new Federal Magistrates Service will provide a model of a modern court. It will use straightforward procedures that ordinary people can understand and use, even if unrepresented.

 21. Ms Diana Bryant QC was sworn in as the first Chief Federal Magistrate last week. The Government is on track towards announcing the appointment of the first 15 magistrates soon. There has been considerable interest in these positions. Approximately 570 people have applied to be a federal magistrate since the positions were advertised nationally in February.

 22. I expect the Federal Magistrates Service will open its doors in some locations by July. Further locations will commence later in the year.

 23. Issues canvassed in the Commission’s 1999 paper on the federal civil justice system strengthened the Government’s determination that the Magistrates Service be a flexible and innovative forum for the resolution of disputes.

 24. A less imaginative and, in my view, less attractive option, would have been to provide more resources to the Family and Federal Courts. This would not have been an efficient use of resources. More importantly, it would have done little to change the culture of dealing with less complicated family disputes. I remain firmly of the view that the vast bulk of matters currently handled by judges can be dealt with more appropriately in a summary manner and by a summary court.

 25. Of course, the Government did consider the possibility of appointing federal magistrates within the existing federal courts. There were originally two levels of judges within the Family Court but this distinction was lost quickly. All judges are now at the same level. Going back to two levels within the existing courts would run the risk of the same thing happening again, so we rejected this option.

 26. More importantly, the Government wants to see federal magistrates develop a new legal culture with an emphasis on simpler, streamlined procedures.

 Appointing federal magistrates to the existing courts would have seriously limited the scope for cultural change and innovation.

 27. To help bring about this new culture, the Magistrates Service has been given some special powers and a clear mandate.

 28. Magistrates and officers of the Service are responsible for encouraging people to use other dispute resolution mechanisms - such as conciliation, counselling, mediation, and possibly arbitration - instead of resorting immediately to litigation.

 29. Magistrates will be able to set time limits for witnesses and limit the length of both written and oral submissions. They also have the discretion to use discovery and interrogatories and make a decision without a hearing where parties consent.

 30. Where appropriate, judgments will be delivered orally. People in remote and rural areas will benefit from being able to access the court through video links and regular circuits conducted by each and every magistrate.

 31. The Government also wants the court to be able to use flexible staffing practices, such as appointing part-time magistrates.

 32. These powers and characteristics will allow the Magistrates Service to respond to the changing needs of Australians. It also reflects the Government’s desire to address head on deficiencies in the civil justice system, such as those identified in the Managing Justice report.

 33. I am confident that the court will take note of the Commission’s findings and recommendations about federal judicial processes to help it achieve its goals.

 The Administrative Review Tribunal

 34. Similarly, the Commission’s report has reinforced the Government’s decision to establish the Administrative Review Tribunal. The new Tribunal will replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and three specialist tribunals -the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal.

 35. The amalgamation of several existing tribunals was recommended by the Administrative Review Council in a 1997 report, Better Decisions. 6

 36. The Managing Justice report analyses the Commonwealth merits review system at length. One particularly disappointing finding was that cases finalised in the AAT take longer than in the Federal Court or Family Court.7 The Commission noted that this is contrary to one of the founding objectives of the AAT, ‘which was set up to provide speedier resolution of cases than judicial processes’. 8

 37. It should be remembered that one of the objects of the Commonwealth administrative review system set up in the 1970s was to establish a single merits review tribunal to stop the proliferation of tribunals. 9 The Government decided that a new tribunal was preferable to merely changing some procedures

 of the existing tribunals.

 38. The objects of the merits review system are to provide administrative justice and ensure government accountability. There is also the object of improving the standard of government decision-making, through an accessible, speedy, economical and informal review mechanism.

 39. The ART will be set up in such a way that the objective of speedier resolution will be achieved. I intend to introduce the ART legislation in the June sittings of Parliament.

 40. The new Tribunal will comprise six divisions to begin with, covering the jurisdiction of the existing tribunals. Divisions will have the flexibility to adopt procedures appropriate to the particular kinds of cases they handle.

 41. As far as possible, the Government wants the Tribunal to develop a non-adversarial culture, with an emphasis on informality and accessibility.

 42. The Commission expressed its support for the further development of court and tribunal procedures to encourage pre-hearing conferences.

 43. The proposed ART legislation provides for dispute resolution processes to be available at any time during the proceedings. It also allows for tribunal officers to conduct inquiries during a review with the outcome reported to the Tribunal.

 44. The Commission also recommended that review tribunals should set performance standards for members and monitor compliance. The proposed ART legislation provides for performance monitoring of members, although it will also be careful to ensure members’ independence.

 45. The Commission’s recommendations about multi-member panels will also be reflected in the ART legislation.

 46. Many of the Commission’s other recommendations concerning merits review tribunals will be matters for the new Tribunal to consider and if appropriate, to implement. For example, the Commission’s recommendations about such matters as professional development programs for tribunal members, complaint handling mechanisms, and use of technology in review proceedings, are matters for the Tribunal itself.

 The model litigant policy

 47. Another welcome series of recommendations from the Commission concern dispute resolution involving the Commonwealth. I will give detailed consideration to its recommendations in the context of the Government’s new legal services framework.

 48. As First Law Officer of the Commonwealth, I am responsible, among other things, for Commonwealth legal services.

 In particular, I have responsibility for adopting and overseeing rules about how the Commonwealth will conduct itself in legal disputes.

 49. When the Commonwealth is party to a legal dispute, it is required to behave as a model litigant. 10 The model litigant policy applies to Commonwealth Departments and agencies by virtue of their connection with the Commonwealth.

 50. The essence of the model litigant policy is that the Commonwealth and its agencies must act honestly and fairly in handling claims and litigation. The policy is based on community expectations that government and its agencies will follow high standards of conduct.

 51. The policy is not like ethical rules that apply to lawyers because of their special professional responsibilities. Indeed, the policy is directed more at Commonwealth agencies than at their lawyers. However, both government and non-government lawyers who represent the Commonwealth must comply with the policy because of the status of their clients, which derives from government’s special position in society.

 52. Being a model litigant goes beyond simply complying with the law, court rules and professional and ethical standards. For example, as a model litigant the Commonwealth must ensure the prompt and consistent handling of claims. We must avoid litigation whenever possible and, when that is not possible, the Commonwealth must not cause unnecessary delay. The Commonwealth must not appeal a decision unless there are reasonable prospects for success or the appeal is in the public interest.

 53. With the opening up of the Commonwealth litigation market, private lawyers representing the Commonwealth in litigation are expected to comply with the model litigant policy.

 54. Perhaps we can, or should, expect to see some cross-fertilisation of ideas about the conduct of litigation between the corporate and government sectors. An interesting question would be the extent to which modern corporations see themselves as bound by any particular rules or ethical standards when they engage in litigation.

 55. It is becoming more common for large corporations to adopt codes of conduct for their business activities. No doubt codes of conduct could be relevant to litigation. There may be value in corporations looking very closely at whether the conduct of litigation should be expressly dealt with in their business codes.

 56. Similarly, private sector lawyers may find that clients will seek out solicitors who meet the standards of the Commonwealth’s model litigant policy. Just as we have seen ethical investment products emerge to meet the requirements of particular investors, there may be a market for lawyers who can develop an expertise in the principles of the model litigant.

 Pro Bono conference

 57. Another issue canvassed in the report is the profession’s commitment to the provision of pro bono services. As we reach the end of National Law Week, it is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution lawyers make to the community, particularly in a voluntary capacity. This contribution is something that I am keen to have recognised and to encourage.

 58. This is why I will host "For the Public Good: The First National Pro Bono Law Conference" at the National Convention Centre in Canberra on 4-5 August.

 59. The legal profession has a long, proud and generally unacknowledged history of providing voluntary legal services to the community. Pro bono work, or work that is done "for the public good", significantly helps people who cannot afford legal representation.

 60. The president of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Professor David Weisbrot, has agreed to be the conference facilitator. Other organisations assisting the conference include: Voluntas - Victoria Law Foundation, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, National Legal Aid, the Law Council of Australia, the National Association of Community Legal Centres, the Public Interest Law Clearing Houses of Victoria and New South Wales, the Law Foundation of New South Wales and La Trobe University’s School of Law and Legal Studies.

 61. Representatives from the public and private legal sector, judges, legal educators and representatives from the business and philanthropic sector will be invited to take part in this historic meeting. The conference also has the backing of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.

 62. The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that people who come into contact with the justice system have a range of options for solving their legal problems.

 63. I am also committed to supporting legal aid commissions and community legal services. But governments - Commonwealth, State and Territory - cannot work alone.

 64. The provision of pro bono work by the legal profession will always be an important tool in working together to make the legal system more accessible. Pro bono work is also integral to the legal profession as a demonstration of its commitment to the community and as a means of nurturing a sense of social and professional responsibility in young lawyers.

 65. The conference aims to acknowledge and publicise the value of pro bono work to the community and to help to promote pro bono initiatives at a local and national level.

 66. Some of the issues to be considered at the conference include awareness of the range and importance of pro bono legal work to the Australian community and structural impediments to the provision of pro bono legal services.

 67. The conference will also consider the development of networks and mechanisms to encourage exchange of information and skills and coordination of pro bono initiatives among legal

 professionals and agencies engaged in pro bono work.

 68. Other topics and sessions will cover research and policy, models of delivery of pro bono services, ethics and overseas approaches.

 Constraints on Government initiatives

 69. In this speech I have sought to touch upon a number of the Government’s objectives in ‘managing’ the federal civil justice system.

 70. However turning objectives into reality - making the system work - in modern Australia is not a simple exercise. There are fine balances to be struck between the Commonwealth and the States, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Add a Constitution that is not easily amended, despite the best of intentions, and you have a recipe for frustrating those, like me, who are entrusted with the stewardship of that system.

 71. I mention the Constitution deliberately, since it undoubtedly constrains governments seeking to adopt innovative approaches to the delivery of justice.

 72. We are not here to debate the strengths, of which there are many, nor the weaknesses, of our Constitution. That is for another time and place.

 73. The High Court has long recognised that the Constitution must be made to work as an instrument of government, not as a legal straitjacket. Nevertheless, constitutional limitations reduce the options open to governments with respect to the justice system. The chief limitation is, of course, the strict application at the Commonwealth level of the principle of the separation of judicial power.

 74. In the past, the main consequence has been that governments must ensure that only courts are given judicial power. Brandy in 1995 illustrates that difficulties can still arise in this area. 11

 75. However, the High Court’s most recent decision on the issue, in Breckler, has given the Commonwealth considerable flexibility in allocating jurisdiction between courts and tribunals. 12

 76. Constitutional constraints on the shape of the justice system have now emerged in a new area, in relation to the validity of cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth and States. Of all the provisions of the Constitution, Chapter III, which deals with Commonwealth judicial power, is the least concerned with state-federal tensions. 13

 77. Nevertheless, the issue has arisen starkly in relation to the Corporations Law scheme, with the High Court’s decision last year in Re Wakim14 followed by Bond in March this year15 and the Hughes case earlier this month. 16

 78. In Re Wakim the Court decided that the conferral of State jurisdiction on the Federal and Family Courts under the general and Corporations Law cross-vesting arrangements is not permitted by the Constitution.

 79. Cross-vesting arrangements had been welcomed as the answer to expensive and inconvenient jurisdictional debates. The arrangements were supported by all Australian governments and facilitated national cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth.

 80. In particular, cross-vesting arrangements were a fundamental element of the fully integrated system of State, Territory and federal administration and enforcement contemplated by the Corporations Law.

 81. Cross-vesting arrangements, however, have been invalidated on the basis of a negative implication drawn from Chapter III of the Constitution.

 82. A further attack on the foundations of the Corporations Law scheme was mounted in the High Court in the Hughes case. The problems that flow from that decision cannot be attributed to Chapter III of the Constitution alone.

 83. The High Court upheld the power of the Commonwealth DPP to institute the particular prosecutions that were at issue in Hughes. However, it is clear that there are constitutional restrictions on the capacity of the Commonwealth to authorise the DPP to prosecute some State Corporations Law offences.

 84. Hughes, and other cases currently in the High Court, have created considerable uncertainty about the foundations of corporate regulation in Australia. They pose a serious threat to the national system of corporate regulation and business confidence. Urgent action is clearly needed to place the system on a solid constitutional foundation.

 85. The Commonwealth has acted to address some of the problems created by Re Wakim and Bond in its Jurisdiction of Courts (Legislation Amendment) Bill 2000 which passed the Parliament last week.

 86. But the Commonwealth Parliament cannot restore all the elements of the cross-vesting arrangements that are now invalid. Nor can it fix the problems exposed by Hughes. It does not have the constitutional power to do so.

 87. A referral of power by the States to the Commonwealth under subsection 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution is currently the Government’s preferred means of addressing the problems. Referrals of power do not present the same hurdles in securing constitutional change as does a national referendum.

 88. Swift and effective action - with the cooperation of the States - is needed to restore certainty and confidence to Australia's system of corporate regulation. A solution is achievable before the end of the year.

 89. I am encouraged by the fact that most states have indicated a preparedness, in principle, to refer powers. Those state governments which have a difficulty with referral need to remember not only the national interest but the economic interests of their own states before they turn down the

 opportunity that referral represents. It need not come to that. I am aware of growing and widespread support for our plan within the business and legal communities, including from the Law Council and ASIC.

 90. Last month the Commonwealth put a detailed proposal for a referral of power to State and Territory officials for consideration. Such a proposal would also enable the Corporations Law jurisdiction of the Federal Court, which was largely removed by the Re Wakim decision, to be restored.

 Responsibilities of other players in the federal justice system 91. The Commission’s Managing Justice Report rightly places responsibility for the federal civil justice system on many bodies and individuals, in addition to government. They include courts, tribunals and the legal profession.

 92. This conference includes sessions focussing on especially serious problems confronting our legal system and comparable systems, such as in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

 93. I am glad to see that the Conference is devoting sessions to such important topics as alternatives to litigation, mega-litigation, native title litigation and lawyers’ responsibilities for managing justice.

 94. The application of competition policy and market principles to the legal profession will result in legal services being delivered more efficiently and economically. However, this will not affect the special duties that lawyers owe to their clients, the courts and the law.

 95. I particularly welcome the emphasis in the Commission’s report on the responsibilities of professional bodies and law schools to develop high-level professional skills and an appreciation of ethical responsibilities in future lawyers.

 Conclusion

 96. Forums such as this complement the valuable work of the Commission to generate ideas for practical solutions to the very similar problems faced by civil justice systems in comparable countries.

 97. The Commission’s Managing Justice report represents an opportunity to review and improve the existing federal civil justice system.

 98. The report conservatively estimates that the cost to the Government of maintaining the system is $470 million each year. 17 These are the public costs alone. 18

 99. The Government is working towards a better system. The Federal Magistrates Service and the Administrative Review Tribunal are important steps towards achieving that. Our partners include the courts and tribunals, alternative dispute resolution providers, legal aid commissions, the legal profession and educational institutions.

 The Commission has my full support in calling for ‘a collaborative and holistic approach to tackling civil justice reform’ from all of stakeholders, including Government. 19 By working together, we can achieve a more efficient, effective and just federal system for the 21st century.

 100. Over a period of 25 years, the Commission has made a very important contribution to attaining this goal. I am confident that it will continue to do so.
