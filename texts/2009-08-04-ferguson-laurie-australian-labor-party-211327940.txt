  Laurie Ferguson MP  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services   

 Darwin consultation to improve refugee services  4 August 2009 

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie  Ferguson, will today meet with Darwin community organisations to discuss ways to  improve services for refugees. 

 The consultation will help develop the tender for the Integrated Humanitarian  Settlement Strategy (IHSS) worth $62 million annually. 

 Consultations cover on-arrival reception, case coordination, referral to mainstream  services, information about life in Australia, assistance finding accommodation and  short-term torture and trauma counselling. 

 'I am keen to look at how we can best support refugees to transition in Australia and  to learn about their new home. Every city is different so travelling to all States and  Territories is crucial,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 Mr Ferguson also met yesterday with representatives from the Bhutanese, Indian  and Filipino communities.  

 'By obtaining feedback from community organisations, other interested parties and  refugees themselves, the consultation will help us to improve and strengthen the  services,' the Parliamentary Secretary said. 

 'Australia is consistently ranked in the world’s top three refugee resettlement  countries, and we should feel proud of what we contribute to international efforts to  make many people’s lives more secure.' 

 The consultations are taking place nationally, with the first in Newcastle on June 29  and the last in Albury on August 12. Eleven different communities in every state and  territory in Australia will have been covered.  

 'This extremely valuable process will doubtless unearth many ideas and suggestions  to further improve Australia’s settlement services,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 People unable to attend the consultations are welcome to provide written feedback  on the IHSS discussion paper through the Department of Immigration and  Citizenship website.  See: www.immi.gov.au/about/contracts-tenders-submissions/ihss-procurement.htm
