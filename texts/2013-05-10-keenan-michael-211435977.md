 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FOUR DAYS FOR LABOR TO COME CLEAN  ON BOAT BLOW OUTS May 10, 2013

 The latest illegal boat, with 81 people on board, comes just days before the Budget is due to be handed down, a budget  that Labor should use to finally come clean on the fact that three more years of their failure on our borders will mean  billions more in blow outs on illegal boats, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow  Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Eleven boats have arrived in just the past week carrying over 750 people and more than 1,500 people have arrived less  than a third of the way through May as Julia Gillard looks set for another consecutive record month for illegal boats,” Mr  Morrison said.

 “These continued arrivals are set to bring more budget pain for Australians whose taxes are used to pay for the  consequences of Labor’s failure to control our borders.

 “With close to 21,000 illegal arrivals this financial year it would be farcical for Labor to stand by its fiscal fantasy on border  protection which it produced in February to argue they would reduce spending on illegal boats by $1 billion next year and  a further $1 billion the following year.

 “Labor’s last pre-election budget ultimately gave Australians a total of $5 billion in budget blowouts thanks to their failure  to stop the boats. They should come clean next Tuesday on the fact that three more years of their failure will mean $5  billion more,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Over 1500 people have already arrived illegally on 19 boats this month and we are only 10 days in.

 “The entire immigration system is in disarray because Labor are overwhelmed by their own border protection failures.

 “The more the Labor Party fails to act on this issue, the bolder the people smugglers become.

 “Labor has no plan and no solution to this crisis of their own making.

 “The Coalition has the resolve to shut down the people smuggling trade and restore order to our immigration system. “ Mr  Keenan said.
