 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 MPS 56/86

 TMMTGRATTON: THF. OBJEC T I V E  V I E W  FOR THE FU T U R E

 Australians must look beyond the short term to see the  real benefits of immigration, the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs, Chris Hurford, said today (Wednesday).

 Based on empirical evidence and historical experience,  immigration, when carefully managed, created more economic  benefits than costs - especially in the medium to longer  term.

 The selection of young,  educated and readily employable  immigrants made immigration more acceptable to the  community because of its economic advantages. It also  allowed Australia to continue with the humanitarian  aspects of its program, including accepting large numbers  of refugees and family reunions.

 Mr Hurford was making a major speech in Sydney to the  second forum convened by the Committee for the Economic  Development of Australia (CEDA) and the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to discuss immigration and  the economy.

 He said immigration policy was often criticised for  allegedly using migrants to fill short-term labour market  imbalances instead of retraining Australia's unemployed.

 "That is certainly not this Government's policy," he  said. "We are upgrading Australian skills by educating,  training, retraining and giving equal opportunity and  access."

 Mr Hurford pledged that the Government would not allow  immigration to take the pressure off continuing this  valuable work.

 Some commentators were preoccupied purely with short term  effects.  This reinforced old misunderstandings about  immigration's impact on domestic employment.  It was  misguided.

 Australia was a relatively young nation, but the average  age of its population was increasing quickly. Australia  was,  by any test, underpopulated.

 "Australian fertility rates and natural increase trends  are low, but they do not prove that Australians favour low  population growth," Mr Hurford said.

 "Many of the opportunities Australians enjoy are from  growth and diversity in economics and culture.  Transfers  of capital, skills,  enterprise and innovation from  overseas make these opportunities.

 "No country can afford to live in a political,  technological and human vacuum, least of all one which has  been heavily reliant on foreign capital, foreign skills  and immigration.

 "Australia has experienced several years of relatively low  population growth, immigration intakes,  net migration gain  and natural increase.

 "Our population density is extremely low on a world and  regional scale. We suffer from a small domestic market.  We are increasingly dependent on financial and commodity  markets and prices determined elsewhere.

 "The case for expanding population and immigration needs  to be seen in this context, not in terms of discredited  labour market assumptions, racial fears and prejudices, or  assertions that belie historical and empirical evidence,"  Mr Hurford said.

 The rationale behind the Government's decision to increase  immigration was designed to bring economic benefits to  Australia by selecting migrants carefully and in  particular, by favouring younger, skilled, educated and 

 self-sufficient people.

 Excerpts from a speech by Mr Chris Hurford, Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, to the CEDA Forum on  11 June 1986 at the Boulevard Hotel, Sydney.

 "FUTURE I M M I G R A T I O N  P R O G R A M S  - T H E  G O V E R N M E N T  P O I N T  O F  

 V I E W ”

 The Government's central proposition, supported by CEDA  and other research findings, by Australia's historical  experience and sheer empirical evidence, Is that  Immigration, with careful selection, creates more economic  benefits than costs, especially In the medium to longer 

 tern. To this should be added that immigration can be a  positive economic and social tool and that policy ought  not to be shaped by reference to short term considerations 

 alone.

 We need to select migrants carefully so as to make  Immigration more acceptable in the community. We need to  do It, also, in order to live up to our International  obligations to refugees and to the expectations of many  Australian citizens and residents to be reunited with 

 their families. We cannot be as generous as we would wish  in the area of the Immigration of extended families; they  cannot have the same entitlement to be reunited as the  Immediate family. Nevertheless we do give added weight to  most of these extended family relationships in the 

 selection process. ("Immediate family" is spouses,  dependent children and, in some circumstances retired  parents; extended family is non-dependent children,  brothers and sisters etc.)

 Few Australians would question the contribution which  large numbers of semi-skilled and unskilled refugees,  displaced persons and independent migrants made to  Australian economic development in the decade or two after  World War II. Even fewer dispute the economic and social 

 contributions made by so many Australian-born children of  settler parentage. But these settlers entered when there  were many more unskilled manufacturing jobs than there are  today. Because of our current economic circumstances,  Australia now needs to attract increasing numbers of 

 people with skills, education and motivation, with capital  and with productive ideas to contribute to the  post-industrial, technically sophisticated society ahead.  Immigration alone is not a panacea for all the challenges 

 facing the Australian economy but it can, if recognised  for what it is, make a positive impact on economic  development, social enrichment and Australia's standing in  the Pacific Basin.

 We are not planning a reduction in the humanitarian  element of our migration program. We Intend to retain our  compassion, but It needs to be said that these elements  represent our unskilled Intake with some adverse economic  results in the short term. By Increasing the  economically-benefIclal part of our program we lend  assistance to the existing unemployed and non-economlc 

 Immigrants. Simply stated, without the economic part of  the program, we would be forced to reduce the humanitarian  element.

 The balance between economic benefit to Australia and  humanitarian considerations is demonstrated In part by the  Introduction from 1 July 1986 of the new Independent and  Concessionary category. This category gives weight to 

 extended family reunion while making employability and  benefit to Australia essential for selection. All  applicants will be assessed against the current points  system, which selects In favour of the young, skilled, 

 educated and employable, but concessionary points will be  given to brothers and sisters and non-dependent children  and also nephews and nieces In recognition of the economic  support that can be given by existing family In Australia.

 Australia is a relatively young nation, with, as I have  said, an ageing population. It is, by any test,  underpopulated. People are, on average, choosing to marry  later if at all, to have fewer children, to exploit  opportunities to work, to study, to travel. These  personal decisions reflect the choices available in a  democracy, where population policy at the community level 

 is largely passive and inherently personal and democratic.

 I do not accept that most Australians would want us to  introduce policies to underwrite a high birth rate at a  time when the world generally, and our region in  particular, are overpopulated. In any event there is 

 little evidence to suggest that Governments can  significantly influence birth rates without destabilising  sound social and economic policies or offending free  choices in family planning.

 A genuine and understandable worry about immigration is  its alleged use to fill short term labour Imbalances  rather than retraining the unemployed. This is certainly  not Government policy. This Government is equally 

 committed to upgrading the skill and education base of the  Australian community by appropriate education, training ,   retraining, equal opportunity and access and equity  policies and programs. A balance needs to be struck. The 

 equation is never static. The Hawke Labor Government is  committed to preserving an appropriate balance.

 This is demonstrated by our increasing priority for  expenditures on labour market programs and services. They  have grown dramatically from $125.5M in 1982/83 to $192.9M  in 1985/86, an increase of 55%. We pledge not to allow 

 immigration to take pressure off us continuing this  valuable work.

 In conclusion 1 say this:

 Australia has experienced several years of relatively low  population growth, Immigration Intakes, net migration gain  and natural Increase. Our population density Is extremely  low on a world and regional scale. Australia suffers from  a small domestic market and the tyranny of distance. We  are a young nation In the process of ageing. Our welfare  burden Is accelerating. We are Increasingly dependent on 

 financial and commodity markets and prices determined  elsewhere. The case for expanding population and  Immigration needs to be seen In this context, not In terms  of discredited labour market assumptions, racial fears and  prejudices or assertions that belie historical and  empirical evidence.
