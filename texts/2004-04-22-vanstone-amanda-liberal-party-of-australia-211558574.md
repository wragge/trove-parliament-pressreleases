 Reappointment of Principal Member for Migration  Tribunals

 VPS 064/2004

 Mr Steve Karas OAM has been reappointed as Principal Member of both the Migration Review Tribunal and  the Refugee Review Tribunal. 

 Mr Karas' reappointment is for a period of three years from 1 July 2004.

 Mr Karas has had an impressive career with the Commonwealth's Immigration Tribunals in senior positions  since 1989, and has been the dual Principal Member of both Tribunals since 1 July 2001. 

 Under his leadership, both Tribunals have achieved impressive productivity improvements.

 As Principal Member of both Tribunals, Mr Karas has contributed strongly to the administrative consolidation  of the MRT and RRT. 

 The reappointment of Mr Karas as Principal Member of both the MRT and RRT will maintain the current  momentum of efficiency initiatives with regard to these two Tribunals, and will contribute directly to the  continued enhanced functioning of the MRT and RRT.

 The MRT provides independent merits review of general migration decisions and the RRT provides  independent merits review of decisions on protection visas.
