 Ruddock's New Duties Demeans Immigration Portfolio Con Sciacca - Shadow Minister for Immigration

 Media Statement - 21 December 2000

 The Prime Minister's appointment of Philip Ruddock as the new Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in addition to his existing immigration responsibilities leaves the immigration portfolio with a part-time Minister diminishing his focus on the current detention centres crisis and the management of refugee policy.

 Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca today said that the Prime Minister had given the wrong job to the wrong man at the wrong time.

 "The Minister for Immigration is under fire from all sides because of his failure to manage the current crisis in his crumbling private detention system and the mounting allegations of mistreatment, abuse and exploitation of asylum seekers in detention. To give him another portfolio at this time, simply means that the pressures on his time will be greatly increased and he will now struggle in both areas.

 "Adding the important and highly sensitive Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio to his current immigration responsibilities does not elevate it to Cabinet status, but rather demeans the value of both portfolios in the eyes of all stakeholders and the Australian public. It is a move doomed to fail," Mr Sciacca said.
