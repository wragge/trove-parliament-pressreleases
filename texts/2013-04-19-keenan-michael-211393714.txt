 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 18,000 ARRIVALS BY BOAT THIS  FINANCIAL YEAR April 19, 2013

 Following the interception of the latest boat, carrying 89 people, there have now been more than 18,000 people arrive by  boat this financial year and we still have two and half months to go, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “We have already had 30 illegal boat arrivals this month, including 11 boats and 831 people in the last week alone,” Mr  Keenan said.

 “So far this month has highlighted the significant failures of the Labor Party to protect our borders - with the arrival of the  largest boat this year and the embarrassment when an asylum seekers vessel made it all the way to Geraldton  undetected.

 “The Prime Minister promised the Australian people at the last election that her Government would stop the boats from  coming, yet she has since presided over almost 500 boat arrivals.

 “This  litany  of  failure  has  come  at  an  enormous  cost  to  the  Australian  taxpayer,  to  the  safety  of  the  people  who  are smuggled down here and to the integrity of our immigration system.

 “The Coalition will return order to our borders by restoring the tough border protection policies that the Howard  Government used to stop the boats from coming,” Mr Keenan said.
