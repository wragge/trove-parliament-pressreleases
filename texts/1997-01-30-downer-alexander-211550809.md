  $2 iVIILLION TOWARDS A LASTING PEACE IN RWANDA 

  Australia is to provide a further $2 million to assist the resettlement of refugees  returning to Rwanda and to help support the network of human rights monitors in the  country. 

  Over $100 000 is to go to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  and I was delighted to have been able to pass this information to the High  Commissioner, Mr Jose Ayalo-Lasso when I met him in Geneva today. 

  This brings Australia's total contribution to UNHCHR operations in Rwanda to $600  000 over recent years. 

  The remainder ofthe funds will go to support Australian Non Go vernment  Organisations (NGOs) working in a range of areas. Assistance includes support and  trauma counselling for children separated from their families during the civil war and  rebuilding much needed water supply and sanitation systems. 

  Since late last year, over a million Rwandans have returned from refugee camps in  surrounding countries, particularly Zaire and Tanzania. Most had fled Rwanda during  the bloody civil war in 1994 in which hundreds of thousands of people died in horrific  massacres. 

  The Australian Government believes that the successful reintegration of the returnees  is crucial for reconciliation throughout central Africa. 

  The Government of Rwanda has an enormous and delicate task ahead to reintegrate  the returnees into their communities. It has identified community \Vater and sanitation  systems as one of the highest priorities for assistance - access to clean water removes a  potential source of contlict within communities. 

  The $2 million is being provided through AusAID , the Au strali an .â‘ \gency for  l nternati onal Development, to 

   " Unittc "d Nations High Commissiont "r for !Iuman Rights-to support its network  of human rights m onitors 

   " AngliCORD (The Archbishop of Melbourne's International Relief and  Development Fund) -to support an indigenous NGO providing services, including  trauma counselling, to unaccompanied children ;   " Australian Red Cross Society -to provide safe water supplies, sanitation and 

  health education to rural communities in north-west Rwanda ;   " CARE Australia-to provide potable water to approximately 14 000 people in  communes in south-east Rwanda;   " Community Aid Abroad- to provide safe water, sanitation and health education 

  to rural villages i'n southern Rwanda ;
