 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling BOAT ARRIVAL EVERY DAY LAST MONTH  UNDER LABOR INACTION August 01, 2012

 An  average  of  one  illegal  boat  arrived  every  single  day  in  July  under  Labor’s  border  failure,  after  yet  another,  with  28   people  on  board,  arrived  at  Cocos  (Keeling)  Islands  yesterday,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration,  Scott  Morrison  and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Every day last month an average of one boat arrived with almost 60 people on board making July a record month for boat arrivals to go with this record year of boats with 7,085 people having arrived in just seven months," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Each  decision  Labor  has  made  on  our  borders,  starting  with  abolishing  the  Howard  Government’s  strong  border  protection policies through to their East Timor farce, failed and immoral Malaysian people swap and issuing boat arrivals with bridging visas and work rights has made the situation worse," he said. 

 "Julia Gillard has a policy deadlock of her own fabrication. It is just another excuse for her to do nothing â her own 'ostrich  solution'. 

 "The  Coalition  already  has  a  bill  before  the  Parliament  that  will  allow  offshore  processing  in  148  countries  around  the world and that is the bill the Parliament should be addressing when it returns. That bill will remove any doubt about the government’s ability to restore the measures of the Howard Government. 

 "Mr Oakeshott’s bill, that he has flagged reintroducing to the Parliament, has already been rejected by the Parliament for good  reason  as  it  abolishes  legal  binding  protection  for  people  processed  offshore.  The  Coalition  did  not  support  that flawed bill then and will not do so again. 

 "Julia Gillard can restore the Coalition’s proven border protection policies immediately. Blaming a self made deadlock in the Parliament is a straw man argument from a Prime Minister who has seen over 15,100 people arrive on more than 230 boats on her watch, the most of any Prime Minister. 

 "Every day Labor refuses to restore the policies that worked on our borders is another day the mess just gets bigger," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "We need to be very careful that our rightful concern for the safety of asylum seekers is not abused by people smugglers to essentially dial a lift to Australia courtesy of the Australian Navy. 

 "People smugglers see our good intentions as another business opportunity and we must not find ourselves unwillingly co âopted into their smuggling operations. 

 "The best way to stop unsafe boats and the loss of life at sea is to undercut the people smugglers business model in every single way we can. 

 "We do know how to do this but it still takes the political will and Labor have fumbled every chance to get serious in  tackling people smuggling," Mr Keenan said.
