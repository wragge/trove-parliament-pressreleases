 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Nauru Hunger Strike

 VPS 003/2004

 I welcome today's announcement that the hunger strikers on Nauru have suspended their dangerous protest of self-harm.

 On 24 December I spelt out all the medical resources that Australia has provided in addition to the Nauruan facilities. Since  then a further IOM doctor has bolstered these resources.

 There have been reports that a team of independent doctors may visit Nauru. If such a group does go to Nauru I would hope  that they advise the rejected asylum seekers on Nauru that protests of self-harm pose significant health risks. Equally they  should advise the rejected asylum seekers that threats of self-harm will not shift the Australian Government.

 As I have said on many occasions self-harm is not an appropriate bargaining chip. The Australian Government will not be  swayed by such action.

 On 24 December I stated that the Government would, on receipt of consolidated information from the UNHCR, examine the  implications for those cases on Nauru previously assessed by DIMIA.

 This position has not changed. 

 The UNHCR has not yet provided its consolidated report. However, they have provided a number of updates about  circumstances in a number of areas in Afghanistan to my Department.

 That material is being considered by my Department. As a result, the caseload is being checked to see which cases are  affected by the further information. Those cases which are affected will be re-examined. 

 I have instructed the Department to commence this process. How long this will take is not yet clear. 

 Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru will be notified by the Department of the steps involved once this has been settled. These  steps could involve a re-examination of the papers, further interviews or seeking further case specific information from  Afghanistan.
