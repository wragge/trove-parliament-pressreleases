 MANUS ISLAND MORE ILLEGAL THAN EVER 

 

 

 

 The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruling today that Australia’s Manus Island detention  centre is illegal surely means the end of the offshore detention of asylum seekers who have  attempted to get to Australia by boat. 

 Australia must immediately respect the Court ruling, promptly shut the centre down and  transport all of the detainees to Australia for processing of their claims for asylum. 

 And while they’re at it, the Australian Government should take the opportunity to shut down  the Nauru detention centre as well because if that failing state had any half-decent legal  system it too would make a finding similar to PNG.  

 The fact is offshore processing is illegal under international law and now has been found to  be illegal under at least one country’s domestic law. It’s also always been deeply unethical  and a gaping hole in Australia’s soul.
