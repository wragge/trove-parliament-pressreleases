 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 K118: Rudd brings up half ton of boats in 2010 

 Tuesday 4th May 2010 

 Boat K118 is the 50th illegal boat to arrive this year, marking another milestone of failure 

 under the Rudd Government’s disastrous border protection and immigration policies, 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for 

 Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.  

 

 “We are barely four months into 2010 and already Kevin Rudd has racked up a half century 

 of boats, with more than 2,400 people on board. This is a staggering policy failure. This time 

 last year three boats had arrived, now they are arriving at a rate of three a week,” Mr 

 Morrison said.  

 

 “For two successive months boat arrivals have hit record levels and 09/10 is already a 

 record year with 94 boats arriving carrying 4,373 people. These are three gold medals the 

 Australian people won’t be celebrating,” he said.  

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s failed policies have transformed Christmas Island into Chaos Island and the 

 government is virtually running its own airline for asylum seekers from the overcrowded 

 island onto the mainland.  

 

 “Today’s boat arrival is also the 12th since the Rudd Government’s cynical election fix of 

 suspending processing of Afghans and Sri Lankans, proving yet again that Kevin Rudd is 

 unable to secure our borders from illegal arrivals. He can’t spin the boats away.  

 

 “With each asylum seeker to arrive on Christmas Island costing Australians almost $82,000 

 in processing costs alone, it’s another reminder that whether on boats, batts or the BER, the 

 only things Kevin Rudd delivers are higher spending, mismanagement and higher taxes,” he 

 said.  

 

 Mr Keenan said: “I visited the Christmas Island detention facilities last week and wonder 

 where these latest arrivals will be housed.  

 

 “What I saw last week was a facility that has been stretched beyond its intended capacity to 

 accommodate this growing surge in arrivals, and will be tested again when this latest boat 

 arrives at the island.  

 

 “50 boats in just over 4 months is another milestone to hang on the Rudd wall of failures, 

 and further proof that this Government has failed to act to fix this problem,” he said.
