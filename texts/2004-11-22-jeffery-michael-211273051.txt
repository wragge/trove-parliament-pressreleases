 SPEECH BY  HIS EXCELLENCY 

 MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC (Retd)  GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF  THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA  ANNUAL CONFERENCE DINNER OF WOMEN CHIEFS OF ENTERPRISES 

 INTERNATIONAL - AUSTRALIA  BOAT HOUSE BY THE LAKE, BARTON, ACT  MONDAY 22 NOVEMBER 2004   

 

 Ms Rosslyn King, President, Women Chiefs of Enterprises International, Australia  Ms Katie Watkin, President-elect  British High Commissioner, His Excellency Sir Alistair Goodlad and Lady Goodlad  State presidents  Distinguished guests  Ladies and gentlemen 

 Marlena and I are delighted to join you this evening. Thank you for inviting me to  address your annual conference dinner. 

 In your invitation to attend this dinner, I was asked if I might say something about  leadership. I see this in the context of your own organisation whose members are  dedicated to innovative and effective changes in the business, economic, social and 

 public policy areas; and effective change always requires sound leadership. 

 As you know, Women Chiefs of Enterprises is a relatively young organisation in the  Australian context. Nevertheless, I see your antecedents in a ‘roll call’ of Australian  women who travelled what were then unfamiliar roads. Indeed the focus of their  stories is not so much on their successes as the paths they each took to get there. 

 All of us, female and male, look to local champions whose richness of life sets the  example and as such is frequently the cornerstone for helping transmit values and  principles. 

 I think of Dame Mary Durack whose childhood was spent on the Argyle and Ivanhoe  stations in the West Australian East Kimberley area. 

 During her lifetime Mary became a prolific writer; perhaps her best-known work is  Kings in Grass Castles. Her first known work is Little Poems of Sunshine (1923).  Mary also wrote under the name of 'Virgilia' for The West Australian newspaper. 

 Mary Durack showed other women writers that it was appropriate to venture into any  and every territory of human experience. She brought to the attention of many  Australians the intimate details of the vast Kimberley region which her ancestors had  pioneered. 

 As a close friend of Aboriginal people, Mary understood the sense of attachment to  place experienced by them and she naturally formed enduring and special  relationships with Aboriginals in the Kimberleys.  

 The outstanding Aeneas Gunn was the author of The Black Princess, published in  1905, and We of the Never Never, published in 1908.  

 During and after World War I she worked tirelessly to support the servicemen of  Monbulk, Victoria who she referred to as “my boys.” She was awarded an OBE in 

  1

 1939, “in recognition of her services to Australian Literature and to the disabled  soldiers and their dependents.” 

 In 1948 she began to work on a book recording all the details of the volunteers from  Monbulk who had served in the Boer War, the Boxer Rebellion and World War I.  Gunn presented her completed manuscript to the Monbulk RSL in 1953 and the book,  My Boys - A Book of Remembrance, was published for the first time in 2000. 

 Mary MacKillop was born in 1842 in Fitzroy, Victoria, seven years after Faulkner  sailed up the Yarra River. 

 Mary’s father lacked financial awareness, so the family was often without a home of  their own, dependant on friends and relatives and frequently separated from one  another. From the age of sixteen, Mary earned her living and greatly supported her  family, as a governess, as a clerk and as a teacher. 

 She went on to set up 17 schools for poor children, orphanages and refuges for  women who had nowhere else to go. Her religious Sisters of St Joseph became known  as the Brown Joeys, and lived as poorly as the people they helped.  

 At one point her church threw her out, wrongly implying that she was a thief and a  drunk. Today her order works in small outback settlements and cities around  Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Brazil and refugee camps of Uganda and Thailand. 

 The Commonwealth Franchise Bill, which entitled women to vote and to stand for  election to the House of Representatives and the Senate received Royal Assent on the  12th June 1902. It wasn’t until 1943 that the first women - Enid Lyons (Tasmania)  and Dorothy Tangney (Western Australia) - were elected to the House of  Representatives and the Senate respectively. 

 Dorothy Tangney served as a senator for twenty -five years. She was committed to an  agenda of social reform including federal powers over social services and  Commonwealth assistance in education.  

 Senator Tangney supported the establishment of the Australian National University in  Canberra. Her priority was the plight of deserted wives and civilian and war widows  and the humane treatment of mental illness.  

 Enid Lyons spoke of her election as a turning point for every woman in the  Commonwealth - that she herself must justify herself as a citizen - that every subject  for discussion, from high finance to international relations, from social security to the 

 winning of the war, touches very closely the home and the family. 

 Enid Lyons directed her concerns to national character rather than over-emphasising  national effort - as she said in her first speech to Parliament: “to provide for  Australians those things necessary in order that the weak shall not go to the wall, that  the strong may be supported, that all may have justice.” 

 Janet Holmes a Court heads one of Australia's biggest private companies, and is the  country's richest woman. But she is also passionate about the arts, conservation,  children's television and world peace. She believes you need to participate in life to  get the most out of it. 

 "I think this feeling that I have for people and the importance of behaving in a way  which is respectful to people of all colours, shapes, sizes and religions goes back a  very long way - possibly to my mother and father in very early stages of childhood." 

  2

 In 1990 her husband Robert died, and Janet inherited the businesses as well as three  hundred and fifty million dollars debt. 

 "I didn't actually think about fear or loathing or terror or whatever, it just seemed to be  something I had to do at that time. There were probably a thousand people working  for Heytsbury and in the theatres and on the pastoral properties and they needed  reassurance that because Robert had died the whole thing wasn't going to collapse." 

 "Now we've got around seven thousand people working, and that to me is fantastically  satisfying - more than dollars and cents, because I just believe that the greatest thing  you can give someone is a job."  

 Another of Janet's great passions is Australian art. The Holmes a Court Collection  consists of over four thousand artworks. Many are lent to galleries around Australia -  for all Australians to enjoy. 

 "I do believe that it is extremely important that each one of us is a participant in life  and what's going on around us rather than being a spectator to it, and if you do that, if  you participate in the world, in your community, your school, your company, or your  country, whatever - then you will be useful and hopefully leave the planet a little  better." 

 Leonie Kramer was educated at the University of Melbourne and Oxford University,  where she gained a Doctorate of Philosophy in 1953. She was appointed professor of  Australian Literature at the University of Sydney. She was visiting professor at  Harvard University's Chair of Australian Literature Studies from 1981-82. 

 She enhanced her public profile as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting  Corporation from 1982-83, having served as a member of the ABC board from 1977.  Other appointments included serving on the boards of the ANZ bank and Western  Mining Corporation, senior fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs and Commissioner  of the NSW Electricity Commission. 

 So what do I see in this necessarily small grouping of wonderful Australian women? I  see in them points of reference for exemplary leadership - in their personal and  professional lives. 

 It has been said that there are as many definitions of leadership as there are those who  write about it. But when leadership is compared to management, the picture becomes  clearer. 

 A number of experts in leadership have defined it this way: 

 â¢ leaders “do the right things” while managers “do things right”; 

 â¢ leaders view people as assets while managers sometimes see people as  liabilities; 

 â¢ leaders look for commitment while managers look for control; 

 â¢ leaders have vision, inspiration, courage, and profound knowledge, while  managers allocate resources, design work methods, create procedures and set  objectives. 

 From my own perspective I define true leadership as generally inspirational, and I see  it as the capacity to persuade people to readily do something you want them to do -  even if they might not particularly like doing it. 

 I am often asked whether great leaders are made or born? 

  3

 The answer, I think, is a bit of both. 

 Jesus Christ, Alexander the Great and Napoleon were natural leaders of great skill at a  very young age, as were William Pitt the Younger and Nelson. 

 On the other hand, the leadership skills of Gandhi, Mandela, Churchill and Mother  Teresa were tempered through experience, hardship and unswerving faith in their  cause - persistency if you like. 

 Thinking back over my career in the Australian Army, of my own experiences in  command and of the leaders I respected, I think if one does one’s best to clearly set  the task, look after your people, prepare them well and set an appropriate example, 

 then those you are leading respond to that. It becomes a wonderful relationship -  between leader and led - and one which can stay with you for the rest of your life. 

 It is interesting in the military, in that one shares as a leader, the same hard rations, the  danger, the dirt, the heavy weight on the back, the lack of sleep and the tension of  imminent battle with one’s soldiers, whilst having to rise above all that to think, to 

 direct and at times to inspire.  

 Soldiers appreciate this and I guess this is why the special relationship so developed  does indeed last a lifetime. 

 Leadership requires neither social position nor title. I believe true leadership is  derived from strength of character, knowledge, courage and moral conviction. True  leaders encourage their people, empower them, and ultimately respect and utilise their  talents. Encourage your people to be committed to a project rather than just involved  in it. 

 We all remember the old story about the difference between involvement and  commitment. In a meal of bacon and eggs, the chicken is involved; the pig is  committed. 

 Calmness in a crisis is an important component of leadership. 

 We must look to society’s leaders, including the business community, for their  participation, in advancing our cause as a nation of excellence; to develop and  promote a culture based on partnership with the community, commitment to education 

 and training, innovation and social responsibility. 

 It’s about doing the right things by one’s employees and the public, day in and day  out. It’s about example and mutual respect. It’s about 20% of the day being spent  moving around the shop floor talking to your people and remembering Maggie 

 Smith’s birthday. It’s also about honesty. 

 And honesty requires the leader to own up to his mistakes. This can be a very  humbling experience. 

 Companies don’t operate in a vacuum, and it’s critical that leadership extends beyond  the four walls of an organisation. The community is looking for business leadership  that can link with it and help create not just greater economic wellbeing, but an  improved environmental and social condition. It’s not just a ‘nice thing to do’; it’s the  right business approach and the basis of good corporate citizenship. I see in this  business/community partnership, an investment, not a cost.

 For those companies involved regionally as well as globally, it requires top  management to be culturally aware and sensitive to social mores that may well be  different from one’s own. 

 Good linkages in Asia rely just as much on friendship and trust as on the legal  context. 

 To conclude, I congratulate the members of WCEI for supporting the Lucy Mentoring  Program which seeks to increase the number of women employed in both the private  and public sectors at middle and senior management level, and on boards. I strongly  support the mentoring concept to encourage relationship building, participation and  the development of personal and social responsibilities through the experience and  counsel of wise heads. 

 As an aside, I intend to strongly encourage mentoring of disadvantaged youth in our  schools, particularly in the areas of literacy and numeracy. 

 I hope you never underestimate the capacity you have to make a difference in your  communities through the liberating influence of constructive leadership. I commend  your membership of the Women Chief of Enterprises International, with its  underpinning commitment to leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship. 

 We need more of you, including in our hard hit country and remote areas. It has been  a pleasure to be with you tonight. 

 Thank you.
