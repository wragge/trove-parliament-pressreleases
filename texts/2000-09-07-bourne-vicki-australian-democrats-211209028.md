 Senator Vicki Bourne Party Whip and Senator for New South Wales Australian Democrats spokesperson for Foreign Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 7 Sep 2000 Press Release Number: 00/577 Portfolio: Foreign Affairs 

 Rampaging Militias must be stopped Senator Vicki Bourne, The Australian Democrats’ spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, today expressed sympathy to the families and friends of the slain UNHCR workers in Atambua.

 "Nobody, especially humanitarian workers, should ever die in such an horrific manner," Senator Bourne said.

 "This appalling murder of the UNHCR workers is even worse because for a year now we have been warning of this sort of scenario.

 "We have known that militias are active in West Timor, ever since the post ballot events in East Timor drove them over the border. We have known all that time that something like this was a very real possibility," Senator Bourne said.

 "I understand from media reports that the Indonesian President regretted the massacres in Atambua. I urge President Wahid to act immediately to stop these rampaging murderers.

 "Indonesia must disband the militia groups and deal with any elements of the Indonesian Army who may be assisting or enabling the Militia's activities," Senator Bourne said.

 "The Australian Government must impress upon the Indonesian Government the urgency of the situation in West Timor.

 "Until the militias cease to terrorise refugees and aid workers, the international spotlight must stay firmly focused on West Timor.

 "Once again we are seeing the International Community forced to withdraw and stand by helplessly while promises are made, but no action is taken.

 "I fear for the safety of the refugees now left behind. With the withdrawal of all UN personnel and aid agencies there are no international observers. I

 fear that we will see a repeat of the atrocities by militias in East Timor”, Senator Bourne concluded.
