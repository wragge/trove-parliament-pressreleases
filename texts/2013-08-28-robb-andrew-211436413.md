  The Hon Joe Hockey MP  Shadow Treasurer 

  The Hon Andrew Robb AO MP  Shadow Minister for Finance, Deregulation and Debt Reduction  Chairman of the Coalition Policy Development Committee 

  Wednesday 28 August 2013 

  The Coalition is committed to living within its means and ending Labor's waste and reckless  spending. 

  Only the Coalition can be trusted to get the Budget back under control and start paying back  Labor's record debt. 

  Ten of the last eleven Budgets brought down by the Coalition were all surpluses - including  the four biggest surpluses in Australian history. 

  By contrast, every single one of Labor's last eleven Budgets have been deficits - including  the biggest deficit in modern Australian history under Kevin Rudd. Labor last delivered a  surplus Budget in 1989, almost 25 years ago. 

  Every time the Labor Party announces tax changes, the Budget, incredibly, ends up  financially worse off. This is because the Labor Party spends all the new tax and more whilst  hitting the economy with new costs. 

  The Carbon Tax Package announced and legislated by Labor has been terrible for the  economy and terrible for the Budget. Spending exceeds revenue by around $7V2 billion over  the forward estimates. The Coalition will abolish the Carbon Tax and associated spending  measures apart from the compensation to households in the form of lower taxes and  fortnightly pension increases. 

  The Mining Tax package has been a disaster for the mining industry and a disaster for the  Budget. The MRRT has raised $40 billion less than originally forecast and the package of  spending measures has left the Budget at least $18 billion worse off. 

  Accordingly the Coalition will abolish the Mining Tax and most of the associated spending  measures. This will leave the Budget in a significantly better fiscal position. 

  When the Coalition makes new spending commitments we more than fully offset new  spending with savings. This is reflected immediately in our Paid Parental Leave policy which  modestly improves the Budget bottom line. 

  1 

  As part of the Coalition's commitment to living within its means the Coalition will more  than fully fund its overall package of policy commitments b announcing more than  sufficient savings measures to pay for them. 

  In addition the Coalition accepts that whilst we do not like many of he savings initiatives  announced by the Government on Friday 2 August 2013 we must pr ceed with the Budget  bottom line savings as presented in the Pre -Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO),  given the budgetary mess created by Labor. 

  ! 

  This applies to all savings other than those specifically identified b1the Coalition as  unacceptable such as the changes announced by the Government on Fringe Benefits Tax for  motor vehicles. The Coalition will not proceed with this flawed tax ion change. 

  Further savings I 

  The Coalition is today providing an update on further savings. 

  Labor has been running an unprecedented misinformation campaign about Coalition Budget  plans. Our statement today goes further than any previous Oppositi n and is far more  comprehensive than what Labor has provided prior to the final day 1· f the election campaigns  in 2007 and 2010. 

  The Coalition has put in place the most rigorous and comprehensive! process for the costing  of our policies and savings ever undertaken by an Opposition in Au,tralia.  I 

  This has involved a process of systematic internal scrutiny, wide co · sultation with  stakeholders, rigorous assessment by the Parliamentary Budget Offi e (PBO), and a panel of  review comprising three of Australia's most eminent experts in pubic finance and  administration. The Review Panel members are: 

  â¢ Mr Geoff Carmody, co-founder of Access Economics and c rrent Director of Geoff  Carmody & Associates; 

  â¢ Mr Len Scanlan, former Queensland Auditor-General; and~1 

  â¢ Professor Peter Shergold AC, former Secretar.y of the Dep ment ofPrime Minister  and Cabinet, and Chancellor of the University of WesternS dney. 

  The Coalition continues to prepare its costings in a methodical, seq~enced and prudent  manner. I 

  The further savings set out today will come as no surprise to the Au tralian people, and build  on the over $17 billion of savings already announced by the Coaliti 

  These additional savings primarily involve: 

  â¢ The abolition of further Mining Tax Package measures- be ause these are currently  being paid for with borrowed money, since Labor's failed m ning tax is only raising a  tiny fraction of the originally forecast revenue. This is not a ustainable situation. 

  2 

  â¢ The abolition of Labor's Carbon Tax Package, not just the carbon tax itself, while  retaining the personal tax cuts and fortnightly pension and benefit increases provided  as part of the package. 

  Because the Coalition has already separately identified how it will pay for retaining  these tax cuts and fortnightly pension/benefit increases, scrapping the carbon tax  package will yield a significant net saving to the Budget despite the loss of carbon tax  revenue. 

  These savings bring the total of savings announced to date to over $31 billion, which  represents the great bulk of the savings the Coalition will announce. 

  These savings confirm that: 

  â¢ There are no cuts to spending on hospitals or schools - Labor's claims that the  Coalition would slash such funding are just more Labor lies; 

  â¢ There are no cuts to spending on defence or medical research - Labor's claims that  the Coalition would slash funding to these areas are just more Labor lies; 

  â¢ Total Coalition savings will be vastly below the $70 billion figure routinely touted by  Labor. That figure had already been discredited as false by various fact-checking  organisations, and this announcement confirms that it is a complete fiction; and 

  â¢ There is no change to the GST- which the Coalition will not alter, full stop, end of  story. 

  It is only the Labor Party which solemnly promises not to introduce a great big new tax, the  carbon tax, before an election, and then breaks its word and does so after the election. 

  The costings released today reflect the latest economic updates provided by the Government  and the Departments of Treasury and Finance. 

  The Coalition is continuing to receive updated information from the Parliamentary Budget  Office. We are continuing to work methodically with our Independent Expert Panel of  Review, comprised of three of Australia's foremost experts in public finance and  administration. 

  The Coalition has not released all of its policies. But unlike Labor, which has not even  launched its campaign yet, the Coalition has now released the great bulk of its policies and  co stings. The remainder will be released prior to the end of the campaign. 

  The Coalition's Paid Parental Leave Scheme 

  Today, the Coalition provides further information on the costing of our Paid Parental Leave  Scheme. 

  The total gross cost of the Coalition's Paid Parental Leave Scheme including administration  expenses is $9.8 billion over the forward estimates. 

  3 

  The scheme will replace Labor's existing inadequate Governments heme, the abolition of  which will save $3.7 billion over the forward estimates. 

  Further offsets to the costs of the scheme will arise from: 

  â¢ Some increase in tax receipts and decrease in benefit payme ts owing to the higher  remuneration mothers receive as a result of the Coalition's s heme. Under the existing  Labor scheme there is obviously less income tax paid by rec pients overall and a  modestly greater call on FTB payments. 

  This will reduce the cost of the scheme by $1.6 billion over he forward estimates  period. 

  â¢ Preventing "double-dipping" by public servants. 

  Commonwealth and State public sector employees will be g"ven a choice of using  their existing schemes or using the new Coalition scheme. he overwhelming  majority are expected to choose the new Coalition scheme, ith the savings of  $1.2 billion to the Commonwealth and State Governments b ing applied to offset the  cost of the Coalition scheme. 

  No state Government will lose a dollar. 

  The net cost of the Coalition's Paid Parental Leave scheme after the e offsets is $3.3 billion. 

  This is fully covered by a levy of 1.5 per cent on companies with ta able income above  $5 million a year raising $4 4 billion over the forward estimates  ' 

  The Coalition's PPL scheme is fully funded on an ongoing basis, an d results in a small net  benefit to the Budget of just over $1 billion over the forward estima es.

  Additional Coalition Savings 

  Today, the Coalition announces further savings. 

  Additional savings from the abolition of the MRRT 

  The Coalition today confirms that it will abolish a range of further spending measures from  the mining tax package- because, with the mining tax hardly raising any revenue, they are  currently being paid for with borrowed money. This will deliver nearly $5 billion in savings  over the forward estimates. 

  These additional savings consist of: 

  â¢ Discontinuing the instant asset write-off ($2.9 billion); 

  â¢ Removing accelerated depreciation for motor vehicles ($0.4 billion) 

  â¢ Discontinuing the phasing down of interest withholding tax on financial institutions  ($0.4 billion); 

  â¢ Discontinuing the Government's tax loss carry-back measure, which was introduced in  the 2012-13 Budget as an inadequate substitute for Labor's scrapping of its  long-promised company tax cut ($0.9 billion); and 

  â¢ Savings resulting from a reduction in administrative expenses incurred for running the  failed MRRT ($0.1 billion). 

  Additional savings from the abolition ofthe Carbon Tax 

  The Coalition has been consistent from day one in our promise to abolish the Carbon Tax,  and the measures linked to it, except for the personal income tax cuts and fortnightly pension  benefit increases. 

  Abolishing the remaining spending linked to the carbon tax will deliver savings of  $7.5 billion. 

  â¢ Discontinuing the business compensation measures introduced to provide partial relief to  selected sectors and industries for the hit from the carbon tax ($5.1 billion)- including: 

  o Removal of the increase in the instant asset write-off threshold to $6,500 ($0.2  billion); 

  o Discontinuing the Jobs and Competitiveness Program ($4.0 billion); 

  o Discontinuing the Steel Transformation Plan ($0.1 billion); 

  o Discontinuing the Clean Technology Program ($0.4 billion); 

  o Discontinuing the Coal Sector Jobs Package ($0.3 billion); and

  â¢ 

  o Discontinuing other small Clean Energy Future business compensation measures  including the Energy Efficiency Information Grants, the Clean Energy Skills  package, and the Clean Technology Focus for Supply C ain programs; 

  Discontinuing energy market compensation measures which wil no longer be needed  once the carbon tax has been scrapped ($0.5 billion); 1  Discontinuing various land sector initiatives which Labor has al~eady slashed, as well as  bureaucracies like the Climate Change Authority ($0.4 billion); rnd 

  I 

  Abolishing other measures linked to the carbon tax that are was~eful or will no longer be  required once the carbon tax is abolished ($1.5 billion). ! 

  Other Coalition Savings 

  Further savings totalling $0.8 billion over the forward estimates wil be realised from: 

  â¢ Redirection of funding from the Carbon Capture and Storage F agships Program (saving  $0.3 billion); and 1 

  I 

  â¢ Reduction in funding for the Automotive Transformation Sche e (saving $0.5 billion)  (announced in February 2011). 

  These savings take the total of prudent and fully casted Coalition sa ings to over $31 billion  across the forward estimates period. 

  All Coalition policies are fully casted and fully funded. 

  A full final castings analysis with four year itemised numbers toget er with a certification of  integrity from the Independent Expert Panel of Review will be rele sed prior to the election,  after all policies have been released. 

  Unlike Labor, whose Budget position has been deteriorating by $3 illion a week since the  May Budget, the Coalition will live within its means. 

  In 2007 and 2010 Labor waited to release their full castings less  day. The Coalition will do better than this.  24 hours before polling 

  Prudent budget management. That's our pledge.
