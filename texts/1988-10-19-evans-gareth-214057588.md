 Australia will provide $300,000 assistance to returnees and displaced  persons in Uganda, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator  Gareth Evans, announced today.

 Continuing internal unrest exacerbated by drought conditions has created an  emergency situation in Uganda of serious proportions. There are  approximately 2.7 million displaced Ugandans in the north-east of the  country.

 "Australia's contribution will be channelled through the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and World Vision Australia (WVA),"  Senator Evans said.

 A special UNHCR program which has assisted more than 300,000 Ugandan  returnees from Sudan and Zaire over the past two years will receive  $ 2 0 0 ,0 0 0 .

 A further $100,000 will go towards a WVA program of assistance for almost  25,000 people in Gulu, north-eastern Uganda.

 Australia's assistance for returnees and displaced persons in Uganda is part  of the Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau, Canberra.
