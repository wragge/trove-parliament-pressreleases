  International Conference Adopts Bourne Action Plan on Tibet 

  Australian Democrat Senator, Vicki Bourne, has convinced The World Parliamentarians'  Conference On Tibet to adopt an international action plan to more vigorously pursue the cause  of Tibetan freedom. 

  Senator Bourne closed the Conference (held in Washington 23-24 April 1997) saying there is a  great opportunity to progress the Tibet issue if the international community follows ~ consistent  and co-ordinated action plan. 

  Senator Bourne's plan calls on parliamentarians committed to the Tibet issue to take and  support action at the individual, community and government levels. 

  "The plan includes supporting the establishment of a Special Rapporteur on Tibet to the United  Nations Human Rights Commission, Geneva and requesting the United Nations Secretary  General to appoint a personal envoy/representative on Tibet. 

  "Most of the points in the action plan are already being implemented in Australia". Senator  Bourne said. 

  "However, there are still things which the Howard Government can do on behalf of the Australian  and Tibetan people to progress this important international issue. 

  "On my return to Canberra, the Australian Democrats immediately will press Foreign Minister  Alexander Downer to implement further governmental initiatives on Tibet", Senator Bourne said. 

  The Conference adopted the action plan as part of its final Communique. The Conference is the  third held so far and included parliamentary representatives from fifty countries. Previous  Conferences were held New Delhi in 1994 and Vilnius in 1995. 

  Conference Communique will be boxed at Padiament House in Canberra and is a\laila.ble on request

  THE WASHINGTON STATEMENT ON TmET 

  April 23 and 24, 1997 

  The third World Parliamentarians Conventio~ on Tibet held in Washington 

  D.C. on 23 and 24· April 1997. notes with dismay that despite the ever 

  growin__g demand by parliaments and government leaders of many countries. 

  that negotiations take place between the government of the People's · 

  Republic of China and the Tibetan government in exile, such negotiations . 

  · have not taken place. Ins~ad, the Chinese government has intensified its 

  repressive policy in Tibet. In particular, reports and observations of the 

  tJN Special Rapporteurs, intem~tional human rights organization5 and 

  parliamentary delegations in the 1ast two years, indicate that the Chinese 

  authorities have 'e8calated.JllQV:eS to erase ,the very identity of the Ti~tan . . 'â¢ ...... . . . . .. .. . . â¢'â¢ . .. . â¢ . ' . :=-· .~· . . . ' . . . .. . : . . . . . : . ·, . ...: :~~· ·.:·"'. :. . ., (. : â¢â¢ .':. .  people as evidenced by:

  -increased torture, imprisonments and death of those asserting their 

  Tibetan identity and political aspirations; 

  -marginalization of the Tibetan language through me~es . such as 

  the closing down of Tibetan .l~guage middle schools and imp.osition of 

  Chinese language in higher institutions of learning, including the Tibetan 

  University in Lhasa;. 

  -attacks on monasteries and nunneries in the name of political re­

  insignificant minority in their own country as the key component of 

  China's ''final solution" to the question of Tibet; and 

  -interference in the religious process for the recognition of the 

  Panchen Lama and the detention of six year old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima,  . -

  recognized according to Tibetan tradition and belief as the 11th Panchen 

  Lama, at a secret location. 

  The Convention deplores these attacks on the life, religion and culture of 

  the 'Tibetan people and demands that they be stopped forthwith. . It further 

  · demands the immediate release of the 11th Panchen Lama .from captivity . 

  . The convention reaffirms the re~Iutions adopted at the first .and second 

  World Parlialnent~M$. Convention (hl New Delhi ~Ji 18::~,20, 19.9'4~.and ..  villnius- NI~; .26-2s. ·19;;;·~·~~~iudirig ... fui-· exp1ici~ reea~titrri~:~·,~r-·:~Ti.~ers:: .. ~;,~-~;~·:.' 

  historical independence and the in~ienable right of the Tibetan people to 

  self-determination. 

  The Con;vention emphasizes its recognition of His Holiness .the Dalai. Lama 

  and :bis government as the sole legi~te representatives _of Tibet and the 

  Tibetan people. 

  The Convention is convinced that a lasting solution to the question of Tibet 

  can only be achieved through earnest negotiations between the People's 

  Republic of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lam.a and the Tibetan 

  government, without preconditions.

  The Convention applauds the statesmanship of the Dalai Lama and his 

  efforts to initiate dialogue and negotiations with China in order to find 

  peaceful solution to the conflict. 

  -

  The Dalai Lama bas repeatedly stated that despite the historical reality~ of· 

  Tibet's sovereignty be is prepared -to hold negotiations on. genuine.. .. sel.£. 

  government for Tibet and the demilitarization and transformation of Tibet 

  into a zone of Ahlmsa (non-vio~ence), without raising the independence. 

  The Dalai Lama f onnally and publicly· reiterated his positiont as stated in 

  the previous paragraph, at the Convention on 23 April, 1997. 

  Therefore, the Convention believes that the stand publicly taken by the 

  govemil':lez:tt of the PRC that the .DaJ.ai ,Lama's. stand on independence is the 

  obstacle to negotiations is unfounded. 

  Consequently, the Convention, once againt calls on the government of the 

  People's Republic of China to agree, without further delay, to initiate . 

  earnest . negotiations .. with the Dalal Lama or his representati~es without 

  pre~conditions. 

  The Co~vention calls upon all gove~ents to use .·their influence at all 

  possible .levels, including. in the United Nations, to persuade the  . . 

  government of the People's Republic of China to accept th.e Dalai. Lama's 

  fair and reasonable offer ··to open negotiations with its leaders. fu this 

  context, the Convention records its appreciation of the message sent by 

  President Clinton to the Parliamentarians convention.

  appoint a special representative to cont.act all relevant parties in . order to 

  seek ways to facilitate .the initiation of negotiations between the government 

  of the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan 

  government. 

  The Convention calls also on corporations, non-governmental organizations 

  and individuals doing bilsiness or working in Tibe~ or China to. use: their .. 

  influence to supp9rt efforts to reach a peaceful solution through 

  negotiations. It also .calls on ~ governmental and non-governmental

  proje~ts. 

  The Convention comm.ends the United States Congress7 the Eurovean 

  Parliament and a number of governments for p~oviding financial support 

  for Tibetan refugees · and their social and economic development. It 

  recommends that o~r parliaments and governments also consider 

  providing financial support. 

  The Convention salutes the Tibetan people who have, in the face of grave 

  adversities and· suffering, consistently maintained their non-violent policy 

  in efforts to protect their fundamental rights and regain their freedom. 

  Successful negotiations are· the only way to prevent the escalation of 

  tensions.
