 ASIO Appeal Against Court Decision Should Concern all Australians 

 Queensland Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett has criticised ASIO's intention to appeal a decision  allowing lawyers for two Iraqi refugees stuck on Nauru and deported American activist Scott Parkin to  view details relating to their adverse security assessments.   

 "This is both an outrageous waste of public money, and a worrying sign of a police state mentality," said  Senator Bartlett.   

 "This isn't even about whether people can view their own security assessment. The government is  appealing against being required to even produce a list of documents - not the documents themselves.   

 "What this means is that people can in effect be marooned for life, or prevented from travelling for life, on  the basis of assessments they are not allowed to even know the subject matter of, let alone the detail.   

 "We've already had cases of a refugee being locked up in Australia for over 6 and half years due to  mistaken identity. The key reason why that took so long to resolve was because neither the refugee nor  his lawyer were initially allowed to see what the evidence was that was used against him. It was only  after a series of court battles that they were allowed to see this 'evidence' and be able to demonstrate it  was flawed.    

 "I've met with both Mohammed Faisal and Mohammad Sagar numerous times over the years and have  witnessed the significant emotional, mental and physical deterioration of their states due to their  indefinite detention.   

 "This is a fundamental breach of human rights and due legal process which should concern all  Australians" concluded Senator Bartlett.
