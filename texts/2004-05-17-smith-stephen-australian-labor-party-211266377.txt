 92 MORE REASONS TO END THE ‘PACIFIC SOLUTION’   

 Labor welcomes the decision by the Government to grant refugee status to a further 77  Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru on the basis of changed circumstances in Afghanistan.   

 The Government has now made decisions over the last few days in respect of 103  Afghans in Nauru.  92 have been assessed as refugees.  The Government needs to  indicate the status of the remaining 77 Afghan detainees in Nauru.   

 As the numbers of detainees on Nauru are about to rapidly decline, Labor again calls on  the Howard Government to end the costly ‘Pacific Solution’.   

 The Government also needs to indicate what is the status of the 50 or so Iraqi detainees  on Nauru.  This is particularly the case as the Government recently announced that, given  the ongoing difficulties in Iraq, it would recommence the assessment of Iraqi Temporary  Protection Visa holders seeking further protection from Australia.   

 Labor has repeatedly said that the Howard Government should end the ‘Pacific Solution’.   In doing so, Labor has indicated it will respond positively to whatever transitional  arrangements the Government sensibly wants to put in place to effect this.     

 Transitional measures include where further processing might occur.  This could be, for  example, at Christmas Island or on the mainland on a transitional basis.   

 Transitional measures also include what to do with failed asylum seekers in respect of  whom it is not yet safe to return to their country of origin.  This could, for example,  include a move to Christmas Island, mainland Australia on a transitional basis pending  further developments in the country of origin, or a third party nation state. 

 

 I note that Minister Vanstone, in announcing the granting of refugee status to these 77  Afghans, has again repeated the following claim:   

 “Australia has made it clear all along that it will take its fair share of refugees needing  resettlement from the offshore processing centres and this announcement confirms the  Australian Government’s commitment to that”.   

 This is a far cry from the mantra of the Howard Government seeking re-election in 2001  that not one of these people would set foot on Australian soil. 

 

 

 

 

 Prior to these recent announcements, nearly 400 asylum seekers originally placed on  Nauru and Manus Island had been resettled in Australia.   

 Recently we have seen the UNHCR afford refugee status to 10 Afghans, and now the  Australian Government has afforded refugee status to more than 90.  On this basis, the  vast majority of the remaining Afghans could be expected to be afforded refugee status.   

 On the Government’s own admission, most of these will be resettled in Australia.   

 That would see more than 500 originally placed on Nauru and Manus Island resettled in  Australia.   

 On that basis, there is no reason in principle why the remaining detainees on Nauru could  not be brought to Australia on a transitional basis.   

 The Howard Government should be open and upfront about what is now occurring.     

 Rather than trying to let people in through the backdoor, the Government should tell the  Australian people that this is the beginning of the end for the Pacific Solution.
