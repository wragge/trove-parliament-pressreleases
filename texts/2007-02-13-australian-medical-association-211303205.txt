 The Secretary  Joint Standing Committee on Migration  PO Box 6021  Parliament House  CANBERRA ACT 2600   

 

 Dear Secretary   

 Re: Inquiry into eligibility requirements and monitoring, enforcement and reporting  arrangements for temporary business visas   

 Thank you for the opportunity to provide a submission to the above inquiry.   

 The  primary  area  of  interest  for  the  AMA  with  respect  to  the  above  inquiry  is  the  use  of   temporary  visas  to  recruit  overseas  trained  doctors  (OTD).  Available  statistics  suggest  that   around 2500 doctors enter the country each year using business visa classes 457 and 422. An 

 unknown number of doctors are recruited using the Occupational Trainee class visa - class  442.   

 The recruitment of overseas trained doctors is a key part of Australia’s response to medical  workforce shortages. The AMA is concerned to ensure:   

 â¢ Every effort is made to recruit locally trained doctors,  â¢ Australia does not actively recruit doctors from lesser developed countries,   â¢ Recruitment processes are transparent and conducted in a timely fashion,  â¢ The skills of overseas trained doctors are properly assessed,   â¢ Overseas  trained  doctors  are  provided  with  appropriate  orientation  and  access  to  

 ongoing professional support.   

 The AMA understands that the Department of Immigration is phasing out the use of 422 class  visas in favour of class 457. A 457 visa provides employers with access to more streamlined  arrangements for visa applications.    

 Current requirements mean that class 457 visas cannot be used to sponsor many OTDs who  come  to  Australia  to  work  as  locum  doctors.  In  circumstances  where  these  doctors  are   contracted by locum services to work for a number of different practices, it is impossible to  identify  a  single  sponsoring  employer.  The  only  option  is  the  more  administratively   cumbersome class 422 visa.   

 

 It  would  make  good  policy  sense  if  this  artificial  distinction  could  be  eliminated.  Data  on   overseas trained doctor recruitment is widely acknowledged as poor and using multiple visa  categories only exacerbates this problem. In addition, the benefits of streamlined application  processes are unavailable to OTDs working in many locum arrangements. 

 06/230  2.  13  February  2007  

 The AMA believes that the current salary thresholds applied with respect to the recruitment  of OTDs are inappropriate. An employer must only offer an annual salary of $41,850 - which  is  well  below  average  earnings  across  the  medical  profession.  This  threshold  provides   employers with no incentive to ensure that they offer competitive conditions to locally trained  doctors  before  attempting  to  recruit  an  OTD.  This  leaves  overseas  trained  doctors  open  to   exploitation  and  they  are  often  engaged  on  inferior  conditions.  The  Committee  must   investigate a more appropriate salary benchmark.   

 Before  the  Department  of  Immigration  will  approve  a  457  or  422  class  visa,  an  OTD  must   obtain  medical  registration  in  the  state/territory  in  which  they  intend  practising.   Unfortunately,  the  processes  and  standards  of  OTD  assessment  and  support  vary  from  

 jurisdiction to jurisdiction.    

 One  example  of  such  variability  is  that  some  states  and  territories  will  require  an  overseas   trained specialist to submit to the Australian Medical Council specialist assessment process,  whereas  other  jurisdictions  may  not  enforce  this  process.  Employers  will  also  sometimes  

 employ OTDs in “non-specialist” positions to avoid the AMC specialist assessment process,  and then require them to perform work that is specialist in nature.    

 There is little doubt that if another Dr Patel situation were to arise, attention would quickly  turn to the class of visa issued. In the absence of national standards of OTD assessment and  support,  visa  arrangements  would  come  in  for  valid  criticism.  The  public  would  want  an   explanation as to why a doctor with inadequate skills had been granted a visa. Trying to shift  the blame to a state or territory medical board would not address the resulting damage to the  public’s  confidence  in  overseas  trained  doctors.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Department  of   Immigration can do more to ensure that OTDs meet appropriate standards of practice.   

 In 2004 the Overseas Trained Doctor Subcommittee of the Medical Training Review Panel   cited  evidence  that  as  few  as  28%  of  OTDs  receive  any  type  of  formal  orientation  to  the   Australian health care environment. Many overseas trained doctors are placed in challenging  work  environments  and  without  appropriate  orientation  they  will  inevitably  struggle  to   integrate  into  the  community,  understand  the  health  care  system  and  commit  to  ongoing   professional development and training. In some instances, OTDs will return to their country  of origin or look for another country where they are provided with appropriate support.    

 In  2006,  the  Council  of  Australian  Governments  gave  a  strong  commitment  to  the   implementation  of  national  OTD  assessment  and  support  standards.  While  the   Commonwealth has tried to achieve consensus amongst states and territories to move forward  with this decision, some jurisdictions have been slow to sign up for strengthened assessment  and support arrangements.  

 

 If  these  delays  persist,  the  Commonwealth  should  close  off  opportunity  for  OTDs  to  slip   through assessment processes by imposing the following new conditions on 457 and 422 visa  applications: 

 

 â¢ Formal  assessment  of  the  OTD’s  qualifications  and  skills  by  the  relevant  specialist   College  â¢ Evidence  of  appropriate  arrangements  to  provide  supervision  and/or  training  as   determined by the College assessment 

 06/230  3.  13  February  2007  

 â¢ A  requirement  for  the  sponsor  to  provide  the  OTD  with  formal  orientation  to  the   Australian health system  â¢ The appointment of a doctor with recognised Australian qualifications as a mentor  for the OTD.

 

 These  would  improve  assessment  and  support  arrangements  and  ensure  some  measure  of   national consistency.    

 The  AMA  also  has  concerns  about  the  possible  abuse  of  class  442  -  Occupational  Trainee   visas  by  state  and  territory  health  departments.  The  skills  assessment  requirements  for  this   category  of  doctor  are  cursory  and  health  departments  do  not  have  to  seek  an  area  of  need   declaration.  They  can  be  appointed  in  any  hospital  for  up  to  12  months  on  a  “structured”   training program, although these often appear to be normal service positions.    

 The skill levels of some OTDs being appointed to these positions are well above what would  be  considered  appropriate  for  a  bona  fide  training  position,  with  some  even  holding   Fellowship  of  overseas  medical  colleges.  In  normal  circumstances  these  doctors  should  be   required to utilise a business visa, however, an Occupational Trainee visa appears to offer an  easier,  less  rigorous  option.  To  illustrate  the  growth  in  the  use  of  this  visa  category  -  in  

 2001/02  there  were  725  occupational  trainees  registered  with  the  NSW  Medical  Board.  By   2005/06 this had nearly doubled to 1326 doctors. There is a reasonable suspicion that many  of these doctors are being used to plug workforce gaps, rather than work in structured training  programs.   

 Overseas  trained  doctors  make  an  enormous  contribution  to  the  medical  workforce  in   Australia.  The  vast  majority  of  overseas  trained  doctors  are  highly  skilled,  however,  recent   events in Queensland did enormous damage to the health system and the confidence that the  public  has  in  overseas  trained  doctors.  Australia  must  have  the  right  systems  in  place  to   properly  assess  their  skills  and  provide  them  with  ongoing  community  and  professional   support. This is what both the public and overseas trained doctors deserve.

 AMA Position Statement   

 

 Australian Medical Association Limited ABN 37 008 426 793  1 

 

 Overseas Trained Doctors   

 2004   

 Preamble   

 The  Australian  Medical  Association  (AMA)  recognises  the  important  contribution  that  Overseas   Trained Doctors (OTD) have made and continue to make to the medical workforce. It is in both the  interests of the profession and the public that appropriate, clearly defined and transparent standards  should be in place to govern the assessment, recruitment and training of OTDs and that every effort  should be made to support OTDs to enhance their long term contribution to the medical workforce.   

 There  is  a  shortage  of  doctors  both  here  and  overseas  and  the  AMA  has  played  a  key  role  in   highlighting  this  situation  to  policy  makers.  The  shortage  of  doctors  in  some  areas  and  some   specialties  (including  General  Practice)  in  Australia  is  well  documented.  While  OTDs  play  and  will   continue to play a crucial role in addressing medical workforce shortages, they must not be seen as a  long-term solution to these problems.  

 

 Having  regard  to  a  global  responsibility,  Australia  must  ensure  that  it  expands  its  own  pool  of   Australian  trained  doctors  to  ensure  that  it  has  an  adequate  medical  workforce  to  meet  the  future   health needs of the population. Necessary strategies include:   

 â¢ encouraging Australian trained doctors to remain in the workforce  â¢ providing adequate funding to hospitals for specialist positions  â¢ undertaking rigorous workforce planning to ensure that available University and Medical  College  places  and  training  positions  properly  match  future  population  growth  and  

 changes in the delivery of medicine   

 In response to community concerns about workforce shortages and the need to ensure that the public  can  have  continued  confidence  in  standards  of  medical  care  the  AMA  has  adopted  a  policy  on   Overseas Trained Doctors based on the following principles:   

 â¢ Australia should train sufficient doctors to meet Australian requirements in the long term  and  should  not  leave  a  structural  imbalance  to  be  filled  by  OTDs.   There  are  strong   ethical  considerations  for  a  wealthy  country  like  Australia  recruiting  doctors  from  other   countries on a regular basis; 

 â¢ There is a need for clear and reliable data to aid workforce planning;  â¢ Medical  Colleges  currently  provide  appropriate  recognition  of  overseas  medical   specialties,  based  around  equivalence.  (It  is  recognised  that  with  respect  to  Areas  of   Need, Colleges may currently assess this by determining the competency of the applicant 

 to perform specific procedures outlined within the area of need (AON) position description  and  that  the  College  must  consider  that  the  applicant  is  substantially  comparable  to  an   Australian trained doctor1);   â¢ Medical Colleges should continue to assess OTDs for the purposes of gaining specialist 

 registration by a Medical Board, recognising that current access to College assessment  may  be  improved  -  including  the  pre-recognition  by  the  Colleges  of  qualifications  from   countries (or institutions) that have similar training systems and environments to those in  Australia;  â¢ Ensuring  that  OTDs  who  possess  the  appropriate  level  of  skills  and  competencies  are  

 able  to  become  part  of  the  medical  workforce  with  a  minimum  of  red  tape  and   bureaucracy;  â¢ Before Areas of Need are able to access OTDs there must be a rigorous and objective  process, including consultation with the AMA, to determine Area of Need status; 

 

 1  This  assessment  process  is  outlined  in  more  detail  in  the  submission  by  the  Royal  Australasian  College  of   Surgeons to the ACCC Review of the Assessment of Overseas Trained Surgeons. 

 

 AMA Position Statement   

 

 Australian Medical Association Limited ABN 37 008 426 793  2 

 

 â¢ Explicit  arrangements  should  exist  between  the  recruiting  agencies,  employers  and   Medical Boards clearly specifying responsibilities prior to arrival, upon arrival and in the  period following their arrival to ensure that OTDs who do not have appropriate skills are  properly  assessed  and  given  relevant  supervision,  training,  orientation,  mentorship  and   support; 

 â¢ Ensuring that as far as practicable OTDs are assessed prior to arriving in Australia and  that all OTDs be given a mandatory orientation course;  â¢ Recruitment agencies should be regulated by the relevant regulatory or statutory bodies  in  Australia  to  ensure  OTD  standards  are  high  and  that  they  properly  meet  the  

 requirements of the position;  â¢ Ensuring  that OTDs  are  given  adequate  supervision  under  the  auspices  of  the  relevant   College if thought necessary by the College;  â¢ Adequate  Government  funding  is  in  place  to  support  the  delivery  of  programs  such  as  

 compulsory  orientation  courses  and  ongoing  support  initiatives  required  to  ensure  that   OTDs are able to fully participate in the medical workforce;  â¢ OTDs  are  entitled  to  working  conditions  that  are  equal  to  similarly  qualified  Australian   doctors in like locations. OTDs should not be exploited by employers by avoiding (or by 

 providing less than) established entitlements or by offering lesser working conditions than  apply to local doctors.   

 It  is  important  to  emphasise  that  the  approach  to  the  recruitment of  OTDs  must  have  regard  to  our   obligations  as  international  citizens.  The  AMA  supports  the  ethical  recruitment  of  doctors  from   overseas. The recruitment of doctors from developing countries, in particular, must be based on the  principles  of  justice  and  fairness  where  the  benefits  of  international  recruitment  and  exchange  of   medical  professionals  significantly  outweighs  any  associated  burdens  for  developing  countries.  As   such, the AMA supports the recruitment of doctors from developing countries only where it is done as  part of a refugee program or on a short stay basis as part of an approved educational or aid program  that is intended to assist in the development of the medical workforce in their country of origin.   

 The  recruitment  of  OTDs  must  also  be  based  on  respect  for  the  individual.  Potential  recruits  must   make the decision to work in another country based on full and accurate information relating to the  position  to  be  filled  and  other  conditions  which  may  affect  their  work  life  and  living  conditions  in   Australia  (eg:  immigration  requirements,  contractual  arrangements,  legal  and  regulatory   requirements).    

 1.  Data  Collection  

 1.1 To aid future workforce planning an integrated approach to data collection about OTDs needs  to be adopted by the state and federal governments.   

 2.  Standards  

 2.1  Nationally  consistent  guidelines  for  the  assessment,  recruitment,  registration,  training  and   ongoing support for OTDs should be developed and implemented  2.2  Subject  to  the  exemptions  referred  to  under  the  heading  -  Areas  of  Need/Districts  of   Workforce Shortage, the standards of entry for an OTD should require that they:   

 â¢ complete  the  AMC  assessment  process  or  other  suitable  assessment  process  as   required by the relevant Medical College  â¢ undertake  a  period  of  oversight  determined  by  the  State/Territory  Medical  Board  on   advice from the relevant Medical College before being allowed to undertake any form of 

 unsupervised practice  â¢ are  assessed  to  ensure  that  they  have  requisite  English  language  skills,  based  on   rigorous agreed national standards   

 2.3  Efforts  to  review  the  AMC  examination  process  in  order  to  remove  barriers  to  timely  and   appropriate assessment continue to be supported by the AMA.  2.4  The  AMA  will  work  with  the  Australian  Medical  Council,  State/Territory  Medical  Boards,   Medical  Colleges  and  other  stakeholders  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  ensure  that  standards  

 

 AMA Position Statement

 remain relevant and in keeping with modern medical practices and training and assessment  techniques.    

 3. Areas of Need/Districts of Workforce Shortage  3.1 To address workforce shortages in areas of need a limited range of exemptions to the above  standards  (except  for  English  language  proficiency)  should  be  allowed  in  the  following   circumstances,  with  the  relevant  Medical  Board  having  responsibility  for  reviewing  and  

 granting their application for medical registration:    

 â¢ OTDs  in  public  hospitals  where  adequate  resources  for  training,  assessment  and   supervision  are  available,  provided  that  they  meet  all  AMC  qualification  requirements   within 4 years (noting that the AMA supports the concept whereby candidates can meet  AMC requirements through workplace assessment)  â¢ OTDs on temporary work visas who work in the public hospital system where adequate 

 resources for training, and supervision are available and they work in total no more than  4 years  â¢ OTDs  who  hold  qualifications  recognised  by  the  relevant  Medical  College  or  who  have   trained  and/or  practiced  in  countries  recognised  by  the  relevant  Medical  College  as  

 having  similar  training  systems  and  requirements,  similar  disease  profiles,   -  provided   their qualifications, skills and recency of practice meet the requirements of the position  â¢ OTDs from other countries or with other qualifications undertaking a period of oversight  as  determined  by  the  relevant  Medical  Board  upon  advice  from  the  relevant  Medical  

 College where their skills are assessed and the results of that assessment are provided  to the Medical Board for review   

 4. Recruitment & Ongoing Support for OTDs  4.1 Organisations that act as recruitment agencies for OTDs must be regulated, accredited and  audited by the relevant regulatory or statutory body to ensure that they properly match OTDs  to available positions. 

 4.2  OTD  recruitment  agencies  must  be  required  to  take  on  a  pro-active  role  and  to  deliver   ongoing support services to OTDs to ensure that:   

 â¢ OTDs can navigate the requirements to practice in Australia  â¢ OTDs can be properly matched to positions  â¢ an orientation program can be prepared for them  â¢ a skills development program can be prepared for the OTD  â¢ their skills can be assessed on an ongoing basis  â¢ support programs such as mentoring can be co-ordinated and monitored   

 4.3  The  recruitment  of  OTDs  should  be  underpinned  by a  formal  agreement  between  the  OTD   and  the  employer  outlining  the  obligations  on  both  parties,  with  the  role  of  the  recruitment   agency being to ensure that these obligations are appropriate and fulfilled by the parties.  4.4 The long-term aim of a pro-active approach combined with the ongoing delivery of support is 

 to  ensure  that  OTDs  are  able  to  adapt  to  the  Australian  health  system  and  enter  the   community as seamlessly as possible and that their skills are developed over time.  4.5  Recruitment  and  ongoing  support  should  be  open  to  private  sector  organisations  provided   they  have  appropriate  experience  and  background  in  the  recruitment  and  mentoring  of  

 medical practitioners.   

 5.  Advocacy  

 5.1  The  AMA  is  recognised  as  the  primary  advocacy  body  for  all  doctors  in  Australia  and  will   welcome OTDs to the AMA, and encourage their active participation in AMA activities. This  includes access to the support and advocacy services that are available to all members.   

 6.  Orientation  

 6.1 Orientation is vital to ensure that OTDs have an understanding of:   

 â¢ Australian Health System and processes 

 

 AMA Position Statement   

 

 Australian Medical Association Limited ABN 37 008 426 793  4 

 

 â¢ knowledge of acronyms and colloquialisms  â¢ their local community  â¢ cultural issues  â¢ their rights and obligations  â¢ medical ethics and patient rights   

 6.2  Accordingly,  all  OTDs  must  participate  in  a  structured  orientation  program.  The  mode  of   delivery will need to be flexible. The program will need to be modular, based around nationally  developed guidelines and be tailored to the applicant’s skills and background.   

 7. Areas of Need/Districts of Workforce Shortage  7.1 To ensure that OTDs are directed to areas of genuine need and that the best use of existing  resources is made, the definitions for Areas of Need and District of Workforce Shortage need  to  be  reviewed  and  where  possible  brought  into  alignment.  Area  of  Need  and  District  of  

 Workforce Shortage declarations should be made in consultation with the AMA.   7.2  Before  a  position  can  be  filled  with  an  OTD,  there  should  be  an  objective  analysis  of  the   reasons for the position remaining unfilled.   

 8. Resources & Supervision  8.1 Employers should not have access to the OTD workforce unless they have in place adequate  supervision  relevant  to  the  requirements  of  the  OTD.  In  this  regard,  national  standards   (including reporting and assessment) need to be developed covering the supervision of OTDs 

 and employers need to adhere to these. Supervision should be to the standards required by  the relevant Medical College or Medical Board.  8.2  Where  an  OTD  will  be  required  to  supervise  other  doctors,  their  supervisory  qualifications   should be reviewed as part of the assessment and accreditation process.    

 9. Information For OTDs & Offshore Assessment  9.1 An OTD Website should be established by the Department of Health and Ageing to provide  OTDs and employers with a comprehensive source of information on all aspects of practicing  in Australia. 

 9.2 To assist OTDs assess their prospects to practice in Australia before arriving, tools should be  made available to them, ideally via the OTD Website, that enable them to do so. These could  include  practice  English  language  exams  and  practice  AMC  exams.  These  should  be   interactive and provide feedback to the OTD about where they require improvement in order  to pass the exam process. 

 9.3 The AMA supports efforts made by the AMC to develop an assessment process whereby the  OTD can complete the MCQ and Clinical Exams in their country of origin.   

 10. Distance Learning Tools  10.1 The AMA recognises the difficulties OTDs placed in rural areas face in accessing training and  assessment programs. In response, the delivery of training needs to be made more flexible  and additional support mechanisms should be provided.  

 10.2  Training  providers  need  to  expand  the  suite  of  distance  learning  tools  to  assist  OTDs  in   rural/remote  locations  to  develop  their  skills  on  an  ongoing  basis,  and  as  far  as  possible   deliver skills assessment programs in the workplace. 

 

 11. Pay & Conditions  11.1 The pay and working conditions of OTDs needs to be protected. Existing safeguards within  Immigration requirements must be  properly  enforced to  ensure  that  employers  who  wish  to   sponsor  OTDs  provide  working  conditions  for  OTDs  that  are  equal  to  a  similarly  qualified  

 doctor in like locations.  11.2  OTDs  should  have  access  to  a  suitable  complaints  mechanism  that  ensures  that  they  are   able to bring forward complaints without fear of retribution.   

 

 AMA Position Statement   

 

 Australian Medical Association Limited ABN 37 008 426 793  5 

 12. Access to Services  12.1 Access to basic services such as health care and education is an important part of ensuring  that an OTD and their family are able to enter the community successfully. Access to these  services needs to be expanded. 

 12.2  AMA  members  should  assist  in  directing  OTDs  to  appropriate  medical  services  and  should   bear in mind the Hippocratic Oath when they treat OTDs as patients.   

 13.  Medical  Colleges  

 13.1 The AMA recognises the fundamental importance of the Medical Colleges in the development  of the medical workforce.  13.2  In  assessing  and/or  training  OTDs,  Medical  Colleges  must  ensure  that  they  adopt  modern   training  and  assessment  standards  based  on  sound  and  defensible  criteria.  The  criteria  for  

 assessing OTDs as well as determining what requirements (if any) should be placed on OTDs  seeking a College Fellowship or equivalence must be based on the following principles:   

 â¢ they should be objective  â¢ they should be relevant  â¢ they  should  have  proper  regard  for  overseas  qualifications,  and  wherever  possible   priority  should  be  given  to  the  introduction  mutual  recognition  policies  along  with  more  

 sophisticated recognition of prior learning processes  â¢ they should not impose unnecessary or unreasonable costs on the OTD  â¢ they should be applied consistently   

 13.3  Medical  Colleges  should  regularly  review  non-accredited  training  posts  to  ensure  that  all   eligible training positions are accredited in order to maximise access to training opportunities  for OTDs.    

 14. Government Co-ordination & Resources  14.1  In  order  to  ensure  that  OTDs  are  properly  trained  and  can  fully  participate  in  the  medical   workforce  as  well  as  the  broad  community,  Governments  at  both  Federal  and  State  level   need  to  co-operate  with  stakeholders  in  the  development  of  consistent  standards  of  

 assessment, recruitment, registration and training as well as support mechanisms.  14.2 To ensure that adequate assessment, support and training mechanisms are in place, State  and Federal Governments need to ensure that additional funding is available for:   

 â¢ projects  to  establish  relevant  standards  and  streamlined  processes  -  extending  right   through to the College assessment and training programs  â¢ ongoing support  â¢ educational resources  â¢ additional hospital training posts  â¢ resources and supervision   

 14.3 Funding should follow the OTD so that employers who take on OTDs can access funding to  allow them to properly supervise and provide orientation for their OTDs.   

 15.  Medical  Indemnity  

 15.1 The AMA believes that the policy initiatives outlined are aimed at ensuring the maintenance  of standards amongst the medical workforce, and therefore should not affect the overall risk  profile  of  the  profession.  The  AMA  also  acknowledges  that  developments  in  medical   indemnity  need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  policy  formulation  and  as  a  basic  principle,  any   additional  indemnity  risks  from  the  recruitment  of  OTDs  should  not  be  borne  by  the   profession.
