 PRIME MINISTER

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER  STATE BANQUET - PAKISTAN  6 FEBRUARY 1989

 Prime Minister,

 It gives me enormous satisfaction to bring greetings from  Australia to you and the Government and people of Pakistan as you  once again assume your place among the democratic family of  nations.

 It is also a great personal pleasure to be the first head of  government making a bilateral visit to Pakistan since your  election as Prime Minister.  .

 The last Australian Head of Government to visit Pakistan was the  previous Labor Prime Minister,  Gough Whitlam, who was received by  your late father,  Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in January 1975.

 Prime Minister,

 In your autobiography, you guote the great American  revolutionary, Thomas Paine:  "Tyranny, like hell, is not easily  conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder  the conflict,  the more glorious the triumph".

 You and the people of Pakistan have indeed been through difficult  years.  But as you yourself wrote,  you kept the flame of  democracy alive during those years, and now with the restoration  tof democratic rule, you have won the glorious triumph of which  Pbine wrote.

 *#our personal struggle in support of representative government  and democratic processes has been much admired in Australia and  throughout the world. There is no need for me to dwell on the  cost of this struggle to you and your family.

 But I do say that the successful and peaceful elections held last  year, and your firm commitment to strengthening democracy in  Pakistan, give cause for the greatest optimism and deserve the  congratulations and support of the international community.

 Prime Minister,

 As a former political prisoner-yourself, you have already, since  you assumed office,  been active in advancing human rights issues,   including the release of large numbers of such prisoners.  You  have also announced policies to alleviate illiteracy and poverty, 

 to improve the status of women in society, to tackle corruption  and to combat the narcotics trade.

 These initiatives together make up an important and challenging  agenda for domestic reform. Your commitment to combat drug abuse  and the-cultivation and trafficking of narcotics'  is one area in  particular where my Government is very keen to assist your 

 efforts and enhance our co-operation.

 Prime Minister,

 Now that representative government has returned to Pakistan,  we  should look for opportunities to build a more substantial  bilateral relationship between our two countries.

 In this task we start from a reasonable base of existing links  between us.

 Australia was one of the first countries to open diplomatic  relations with Pakistan, with an Australian diplomatic mission  being established early in 1948.

 Australia's first Muslim community consisted of people from what  is now Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier province of  Pakistan. This community built Australia's first mosque, and  some of their descendants are numbered among the 250,000 Muslims  who live in Australia today.

 Since the independence of Pakistan,  our two countries have worked  together on a range of political and humanitarian issues,   including those associated with the Soviet occupation of  Afghanistan. . ’  t _ _  ' 

 Sport provides another sort of link, one that draws our peoples,   ^  not just our governments,  together.

 Names like Mushtaq Mohammed, Asif Iqbal, Sarfraz Nawaz and,  today, Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Abdul Qadir are as familiar  to Australians as they are to P a k i s t a n i s W e look forward to  your cricketers making a full test tour of-Australia next year.

 In addition to our shared obsession with cricket, hockey and  squash, our two countries have much in common.

 3.

 And yet Prime Minister we can_do better. We can add new  substance to the relationship.  ~ This,  I believe,  is particularly  so in the field of trade and economic co-operation.

 These are areas which, if developed properly, could see  significant benefits accruing to both countries. We need to  encourage a greater understanding in our respective business  communities of the opportunities that exist,  and we need to  encourage proposals for expanding business and commercial links.  

 One specific form of activity which could be pursued more  vigorously is the setting up of joint ventures, particularly  those centred on the transfer of technology.

 Prime Minister,

 In suggesting closer economic co-operation, I am aware that our  two economies are at different stages in their development,  and  that there is a number of immediate challenges which you face in  the economic sphere.

 I know that among your current concerns is the shortfall in  Pakistan’s wheat supply because of the drought.  I would like to  take this opportunity to assure you publicly that my Government  is sympathetic to these concerns. To this end we will provide an 

 immediate emergency aid contribution of 25,000 tonnes of wheat  valued at some A$5.5 million.

 Australia has always stood ready to provide humanitarian  assistance to people in need and we hope that this contribution  can assist in overcoming the difficulties facing your people.

 In addition to the immediate food aid, my Government is also  interested in enhancing our development co-operation program with  Pakistan. I look forward to exchanging ideas with you tomorrow  on what we might be able to do.

 Prime Minister,

 One of the greatest challenges facing us as we move towards the  ^_.: last decade of the twentieth century, a century sadly   twenty-first century.  We cannot leave as our legacy to future  generations an international order that is characterised by  instability, intolerance and fear.  ~ 4 . There are encouraging developments,  as a result of moves by the  Soviet Union, the United States and China, to replace the  confrontation of the past with -constructive dialogue.  In my  recent meetings with the leadership of these countries, I have  been impressed by their determination to tackle difficult  questions and to take forward issues that were once the subject  of impasse or intertia. Australia has done whatever it can to  encourage that process. One issue that has affected both of us is Afghanistan,  which was  not only a cause for regional and international instability, but  also a focus of humanitarian concern.  '  â  The conclusion of the Geneva Accords leading to the withdrawal of  Soviet troops from Afghanistan was an important and commendable  achievement. It highlighted the very positive changes underway  in the Soviet Union and was a profound demonstration of the way  in which improved superpower relations can have a direct and real  impact on regional disputes. The international community appreciates the substantial  contribution by Pakistan in providing a safe haven for the  estimated 3.5 million refugees from Afghanistan. As you know,  Australia has rendered assistance to these refugees through  contributions of food aid and other assistance worth over $45  million.  We have also pledged a contribution of $20 million to  the appeal launched by the United Nations special co-ordinator  for Afghanistan to assist Afghan refugees in returning to their  homeland. Another area in which we have witnessed the positive benefits  from this new spirit of co-operation between the superpowers,  is  in the field of disarmament,  where important commitments have  been made to reduce the nuclear and other weapons arsenals which  threaten our very existence. In South Asia, Australia has watched with concern the threat of  nuclear proliferation. It was in this context that we welcomed  (the recent initiative taken by you and Prime Minister Gandhi in  signing an agreement prohibiting attacks on each other's nuclear  installations.  It is our hope that this agreement will lead to  â ^further steps which can help to assure that the nuclear programs  pursued in the region are directed solely towards peaceful  non-explosive uses. I would like to restate the Australian Government’s firm  conviction that the widest possible adherence to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty is essential if we are to eliminate the  spectre of a nuclear holocaust. 5. Prime Minister, We acknowledge Pakistan as an important member of the South Asian  region. Australia, indeed the world, has a clear interest in  stability and peace in South Asia. It is for this reason, as  well as -the potential for improving the living standards of the  member countries, that we welcome the dialogue and co-operation  being forged through the SAARC. It is for the same reason that  we applaud the steps which you, so early in your period in  office, and Prime Minister Gandhi in India have taken to reach  out to one another and reduce the tensions which ;have too often  affected relations between your countries. ' Let me place on record that Australia warmly welcomes your  Government's decision to rejoin the Commonwealth. We have always  supported this and speaking for Australia would welcome without  hesitation your representing democratic Pakistan at the next  Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kuala Lumpur in October. I began, Prime Minister, by referring to your autobiography. Since the author does not exist who resents favourable guotation,  let me end in the same vein. "Nobody who loves Pakistan," you wrote, "can help dreaming of a  great and prosperous future for our country and for the people.  But drastic steps must be taken to preserve that vision." You are ushering in a new period in Pakistani history - a period  of hope and reform, and we hope, of peace and prosperity. We wish you well as you undertake the hard work that lies ahead  of you. I thank you for your hospitality, and I look forward to welcoming  you soon to Canberra. -  ****************************** â  â¢ e — · â
