 HIDDEN COSTS OF ASYT .IJM SEEKERS

 Hidden away in the back of the Prime Minister's economic statement, in  very small print under the heading "Significant Decisions Made Prior to the  February Statement" are two previously unannounced budgetary 

 expenditures.

 Over the next four years the Government has allocated $105 million for the  asylum seeker relief support program. This will primarily provide funds for  the 23,000 applicants for refugee status in Australia.

 Yet another legacy of ex-Prime Minister Hawke's ill-judged decision on the  Chinese students. How much more will this decision cost the Australian  taxpayer?

 It is also an admission that, far from the nine months Minister Hand has  promised it will take to clear the refugee determination backlog, it will take  at least another 4 years.

 The second "significant decision" was an allocation of $28 million to the  review of refugee determination system over the next two years.

 However we still don't know all the details of changes which have been  made, or will be made, to the refugee determination process.

 The Australian taxpayer is entitled to know the full costs of cleaning up  after the ex-Prime Minister's decision on the Chinese students, as they are  entitled to know exactly what the review of the refugee determination 

 system entails.

 It is time for the Minister to come clean.
