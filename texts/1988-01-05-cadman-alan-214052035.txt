 VIETNAMESE REFUGEES - A DISGRACE

 "The handling o f  the cases of t w o  refugee students from Vietnam  has been a disgraceful denial of rights created by the   Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Immigration & Ethnic Affairs and the Canberra College of Advanced Education," Mr. Alan Cadman, M.P., Shadow Minister for Immigration & Ethnic   Affairs said today. '

 "The obvious humanitarian factors in these cases have not been   looked at by the Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs and   he should do so immediately and reverse his decision which   rejects the claims of the students.

 "On the educational aspect of this matter, lack of supervision ,   has made the Canberra College of Advanced Education an instrument   of the Vietnamese Embassy (perhaps unwittingly). The Australian   community is footing the bill for an educational programme in   which students are controlled by foreign operatives.

 "The Department of Foreign Affairs has known the details of the   defectors from day one and has acted only to have the students   give up any claim to freedom and has tried to persuade the students to   return to Vietnam.

 "I reject any assurance that is given by the Vietnamese Government   that the students' future will not be jeopardised on their return   to Vietnam.

 "There needs to be a full inquiry into the w h o l e .shameful matter. Where there is a policy it has not been administered and where   there is no policy it has not been thought through.

 "A full ^inquiry into the conduct of the Department of Foreign   Affairs _&fld=-ihe Canberra College of Advanced Education should be   launched to clarify policy and its administration."
