 PM Steers Australia into Legal Minefield: East Timor Option Embarrassing - Brown

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has welcomed the legal action being taken to uphold the rights of the asylum seekers aboard the Tampa.

 "The 450 people on the Tampa are in Australia's territory and subject to Australian law," said Senator Brown.

 "The people taking this court action have every right to ensure the legal rights of all those aboard, including the Norwegian crew, are upheld.

 "There is no doubt in the eyes of the world that the ship is being held captive by Australia, in Australian territory, by armed guard under Prime Ministerial directive.  It is a military operation in Australian waters.

 "This is a legal minefield that the Prime Minster has steered the ship of state into.

 "That the Government's best response is to suggest that the asylum seekers on the Tampa go to East Timor, is a huge embarrassment for Australia.

 "That a country that has borne so much should be asked to take the asylum seekers while its wealthy neighbor refuses, defies belief," Senator Brown said.
