  Media Release

  The Hon Duncan Kerr, MP

  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

  

 4 November 1999

  

  Ruddock announces failure of Howard and Max 
Moore-Wllton

  Coastal Surveillance Taskforce

  

  “Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock’s announcement of a third 
Gover nment inquiry into illegal boar arrivals is an admission 
that the Prime Minister’s recent Inquiry was a failure,” said Duncan 
Kerr, Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs.

  

 “In June this year, the Prime Minister’s Coastal 
Surveillance Task Force, headed by Max Moore-Wilton and including senior 
Defence and Security personnel, published its report.

  

 “The Report subsumed an earlier inquiry commissioned 
by Customs Minister, Senator Vanstone and headed by retired Air Vice 
Marshal Heggen.

  

 “The measures contained in Max Moore-Wilton’s 
recommendations and adopted by the Prime Minister were hailed as the 
answer to halt the tide of boar people.

  

 “Nearly 1300 illegals have arrived by sea alone 
since the Report.

  

 “In announcing this new inquiry, Mr Ruddock has 
effectively declared the Prime Minister’s Inquiry a waste of time 
and money; and Max Moore-Wilton’ s recommendations now up for review. 
On Monday, a boat carrying 352 boat people landed on Ashmore Reef. This 
is the largest such arrival on our shores.

  

 “The fact that boat people can choose where to dock 
is a serious issue of national security. The problem is compounded as 
news of successful landings is sent back and we are seen as a soft target.

  

 “Senator Vanstone is the Minister responsible for 
coastal surveillance. She has been missing from this debate since the 
Heggen Inquiry announcement.

  

 “Of course the Government would rather treat this 
as an immigration issue. It provides them with easy scapegoats - those 
being exploited by people smugglers.

  

 “If our border security was adequate, fewer and 
fewer boats would choose Australia as a target and there would not be 
the massive illegal immigration problem that has caused us to build 
a tent city at Curtin in WA to house recent arrivals.

  

 “Frontline border control requires an integrated 
approach. That is why the Opposition is calling on the Government to 
examine the option of establishing a properly resourced and dedicated 
force charged with protecting our borders - an Australian Coastguard.”
