 MEDIA RELEASE 

 The Hon Bruce Billson MP  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade        

 AA 04 079                                                                                  Saturday 27 November 2004 

 

 Australia readies for South Pacific cyclone season   

 Officials from Australia, France and New Zealand are meeting in Tahiti today to review  disaster response strategies for the upcoming South Pacific cyclone season, the  Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Bruce Billson, announced today.   

 ‘Disasters can only be anticipated, not predicted, so preparedness and response capability is  everything and Australia values our regional partnerships as a means to rapidly respond to  help disaster victims,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘Over the past two years, the Australian Government in partnership with France and New  Zealand have responded to four major cyclones that caused loss of life and widespread  damage in South Pacific nations. There is a high probability of more natural disasters over  the next few months.    

 ‘Under the France Australia New Zealand (FRANZ) Agreement of 1992, there are regular  meetings by the three partners to review disaster relief cooperation to respond to cyclones  and other natural disasters.’   

 The Parliamentary Secretary said Australia’s recent rapid response to help victims of the  earthquake on the Indonesian island of Alor, demonstrates the benefits of forward-thinking  disaster strategies.   

 ‘Because of mechanisms already in place, Australian-funded emergency relief supplies such  as medicine and shelter, were able to reach victims within hours of the disaster,’ Mr Billson  said.   

 Earlier this year, Australia provided emergency cyclone relief, including food, water and  first aid to victims in Samoa, Vanuatu and Niue.    

 ‘The Australian Government is committed to an effective ongoing aid program in the region  and also providing a rapid disaster response to help communities in need,’ Mr Billson said.    

 In 2004-2005, Australia increased overseas aid funding by nearly ten per cent to $2.133  billion and augmented by an estimated $14 million to $146 million, our international  humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs.
