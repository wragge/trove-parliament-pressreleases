 RECORD FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS 14 May 2002 MIN 61/02

 The Howard Government has allocated a record Budget amount of $6.6 billion to Australian schools for 2002-03.

 The unprecedented funding for schools in 2002-03 continues the trend of the last six Howard Government Budgets. Since 1995-96 Commonwealth funding for schools has grown by over 80%.

 In 2002-03, $2.4 billion is being provided for Government schools - an increase of 5.7% over the past year and a 52% increase since 1996.

 This very substantial level of funding is producing real results for students.

 For instance, the 2000 National Reading and Numeracy results for Year 3 and 5 students showed that 92.5% of Year 3 students and 87.4% of Year 5 students achieved the minimum standard needed to make progress through schooling.

 In numeracy, 92.7% of Year 3 and 89.6% of Year 5 students achieved the national minimum standard.

 This Budget continues funding programmes that improve the literacy and numeracy outcomes of our disadvantaged students.

 We are determined to close the gap between the learning outcomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. The Government will provide $445 million in 2002-03 to enhance the outcomes of Indigenous students in schooling, training and higher education.

 This record level of targeted assistance is mostly provided through the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives programme ($64.9 million), the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance programme ($167.9 million) and the ABSTUDY programme ($183.7 million).

 The Budget also provides additional funding of $82.4

 million over three years to support the professional development of teachers through continuation of the Quality Teacher Programme.

 This brings the Howard Government’s commitment to quality teaching in Australia’s schools to $159.2 million over five years. Most of this funding goes to teachers in Government schools.

 Additional funding of $67.2 million over four years is also being made available for new school students arriving in Australia following the Government’s decision to increase the permanent migration intake in 2002-03. Under this measure:

 The English as a Second Language (ESL) New Arrivals Programme will provide an additional $12.1 million over 2002-03 to 2005-06 to help these students learn English.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In addition, $55.1 million over that period will be made available in General Recurrent Grants to provide for their general schooling costs.

 The Government has also decided, as part of its Humanitarian Migration Programme, to provide funding of $14.3 million over four years to extend access to the English as a Second Language New Arrivals Programme, to minors who hold temporary visas in the humanitarian and refugee arrivals category, from 1 July 2002.

 I believe that with this Budget the Government is continuing its leadership role in demanding the best for our students.
