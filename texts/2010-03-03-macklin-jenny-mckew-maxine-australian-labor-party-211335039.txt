 Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs 

 Media Release 

 New mental health services for refugees 

 03/03/2010 

 Joint Media Release with  Maxine McKew MP, Member for Bennelong 

 The Australian Government is providing $5.4 million for new services and workers to give  humanitarian entrants with a mental illness access to one-on-one support through the Personal  Helpers and Mentors (PHaMs) program.  

 The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, and  the Member for Bennelong, Maxine McKew, made the announcement while visiting staff and clients at  New Horizons in North Ryde. 

 New Horizons will receive $1.2 million in additional funding to expand their current programs, and  provide more targeted help for humanitarian entrants in Northern and Western Sydney. This is on top  of their existing ongoing funding of $1.7 million until 30 June 2012 in these locations. New Horizons  delivers PHaMs in 10 sites in New South Wales. 

 The $5.4 million will establish two new PHaMs services in communities with significant humanitarian  entrant populations in Liverpool in New South Wales and Inner North Adelaide to help people with a  mental illness who are humanitarian entrants, such as refugees and other people displaced from their  homelands. 

 In addition, ten new workers will be shared among five existing PHaMs sites in New South Wales,  South Australia and Victoria to work specifically with humanitarian entrants. 

 In total, 20 additional personal mentors will be on the ground by mid 2010 to provide intensive  assistance to humanitarian entrants with a severe mental illness. 

 "These additional services will provide humanitarian entrants, suffering severe mental illness, with the  support they need to connect with the wider community and to live more independent and satisfying  lives," Ms Macklin said.  

 "The trauma of leaving your home, sometimes by force, can be deeply distressing for those who  suffer from mental illness.  

 "Personal mentors work one-on-one with participants with practical help to achieve their personal  goals - for example, improving relationships with family and friends." 

 These new personal mentors will also connect participants with essential clinical and social services,  including housing services and health professionals. 

 "The one-on-one support provided by personal helpers and mentors is so important for humanitarian  migrants, who really need extra support to connect with their new community," said Ms McKew. 

 "New Horizons provides the help that counts most for those who need it, and ensures that they start  their journey in Australia on the best possible footing."
