 Australian Democrats Press  Releases

 Senator Andrew Bartlett Deputy Parliamentary Leader and Democrats Senator  for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs

 Dated: 27 May 2005

 Press Release Number: 05/283

 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Immigration: The Mess Continues

 Democrats Deputy Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said examples of the Governments  dishonesty, incompetence and knee-jerk backflips in the immigration area have become too  numerous to keep track of.

 This crucial area of public policy is now in a total shambles, as more and more instances of  inconsistencies and absurdities come to light, Senator Bartlett said. 

 The current shambles is not the fault of one Minister or one Departmental Secretary, it is the  inevitable outcome when any Government and Department is given massive powers with  grossly inadequate accountability mechanisms and no independent review of key areas of  decision making. A Royal Commission is the only way to ensure a proper overhaul is done of a  problem that has been decades in the making.

 Senator Bartlett listed examples of unacceptable actions which had come to light since just  yesterday:

 - Statements by a DIMIA official to Senate Estimates there was no requirement over the last 3  years for the Government to do follow up investigations of asylum seekers on Nauru whose  claims may raise concerns under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) or the International  Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

 - Statements reported today by a leading migration agent that some DIMIA officials were  knowingly giving false or unverified information to the Minister about particular cases

 - Reports of a Chinese person being released from detention in Port Augusta on Monday and  given a bus ticket to Melbourne, where he reported to DIMIA on Wednesday to get his Bridging  Visa, only to be re-detained and sent all the way back to Baxter 

 - Reports that only DIMIA officers are now allowed to photographs of the newborn asylum  seeker baby, despite Minister Vanstones public statement to the contrary

 - The Prime Minister repeatedly saying that the Vietnamese asylum seekers with the newborn  baby are illegally in Australia, when it is well established that it is not illegal to enter Australia to  seek asylum.

 - The Prime Minister also made the absurd statement that these people who claim to be at risk  of serious persecution can return to Vietnam at any time.

 The steady stream of stuff-ups and injustices will grow to a torrent unless the Prime Minister  shows some genuine leadership and strength and initiates a Royal Commission, Senator  Bartlett said.
