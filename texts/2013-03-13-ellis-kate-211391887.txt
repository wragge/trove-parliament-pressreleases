 MEDIA RELEASE 

 13 March 2013   

 GETTING EVEN MORE AUSTRALIANS INTO A JOB   

 Minister for Employment Participation Kate Ellis today announced the Australian  Government is extending consultations to find the ultimate model for the future of  job services in Australia.   

 Minister Ellis said Job Services Australia (JSA) has delivered better outcomes for  job seekers since it was introduced in 2009 and is calling for ideas to make it  even better.   

 “We want to make sure all Australians share the benefits our strong economy  and have the dignity and security of a job,” Minister Ellis said.   

 “Since coming into Government we have created more than 800,000 jobs and we  believe all Australians no matter their walk in life should have the opportunity to  have a job.   

 “Our JSA is already delivering jobs for our most disadvantaged Australians at  twice the rate than the old system under the Howard Government - but we know  we can do more.    

 “We want to hear ideas on how we can build the ultimate employment services  model that will take us into the future.”   

 Minister Ellis said JSA is delivering better results at getting more of the most  disadvantaged Australians into work compared to the old system under the  Howard Government, including:  â¢ More than double the in the number of jobs secured for people with a 

 disability each year 

 â¢ Around three times the number jobs secured for people from a non-English  speaking background each year  â¢ More than double the number of jobs secured for mature aged Australians each  year 

 

 Minister Ellis attended a consultation session with key stakeholders in Canberra  today as part of series of nationwide stakeholder consultation sessions to help  inform how Australia’s future employment services will operate from July 2015.   

 

 “We want to build on what is already a strong system that is achieving real  results - our historic decision to uncap Disability Employment Services has  resulted in a 45 per cent increase in the number of people with disability  receiving services to help them find and keep work,” Minister Ellis said.   

 Minister Ellis welcomed the involvement of organisations representing the  interests of refugees and migrants, parents, young people, mature-age and  Indigenous Australians, the homeless and people with disability.    

 "These consultations will build on our Issues Paper released in December last  year and we want to hear back about how we can better meet the needs of job  seekers and work in partnership with employers to get even more Australians  into jobs,” Minister Ellis said.   

 Consultation with job seekers, employers and employment service providers to  get their ideas on the issues paper has been extended till Friday 22 March 2013.
