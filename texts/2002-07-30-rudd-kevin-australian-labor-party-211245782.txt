 MEDIA RELEASE

 SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN SAHARA

 I am deeply concerned for the future self-determination of Western Sahara - a former Spanish colony, much of whose territory has been under Moroccan occupation and control for many years.

 A long-established resistance movement Polisario still controls the eastern desert region of the original colony of Western Sahara, which is potentially rich in offshore oil reserves. Many Saharawi refugees have fled to Polisario-controlled areas or to refugee camps in neighbouring Algeria.

 Although no UN-approved decolonisation process has ever taken place in Western Sahara, various members of the UN Security Council may be currently considering a “Draft Framework Agreement” proposal - which would effectively legitimise Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara.

 Morocco effectively occupies the territory with 200,000 soldiers and has imported 150,000 settlers.

 For the people of Western Sahara to have access to a genuine act of self-determination, I believe the only legal and viable solution is the implementation of the UN- Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Settlement Plan. This UN-OAU Settlement Plan establishes the framework for a free and fair referendum for the people of Western Sahara.

 All members of the UN Security Council should intensify their efforts to expedite an ethical decolonisation process in Western Sahara.

 It is time the UN acted and gave the Saharawis a fair opportunity to determine their own future.

 Ends 30 July 2002
