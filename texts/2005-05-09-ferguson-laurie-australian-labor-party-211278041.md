 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 

 LAURIE FERGUSON MP            SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION 

        FEDERAL MEMBER FOR REID  9 May 2005   

 EAST TIMORESE - CHARACTER TESTS A  FURPHY   

 Labor reiterates its position of March 2003 that the East Timorese asylum seekers 

 “deserve our compassion,” having “fled real persecution” and because their prolonged 

 stay can be attributed to the fact that the “Government’s embarked on a strategy of 

 deliberately freezing the processing”.  

 

 Labor’s Shadow Minister for Immigration, Mr Laurie Ferguson said today: 

  “Clearly in recent days there has been selective leaking from DIMIA sources of the 

 Department’s defence that many have character issues.   These remarks are about a very 

 small group of forty eight people who can be readily identified. Some have already faced 

 aspersions in their workplaces.  This conduct is to be deplored.” 

 

 “It is clear that the overwhelming majority have no character issues whatsoever.  

 Virtually all of the others have received community service orders which are indicative of 

 the nature of their offences.  Many have experienced gruesome personal events in their 

 lives and this should provide the context for some offences,” said Laurie Ferguson. 

 

 “The Government should seek police checks as a matter of urgency to gain a verifiable 

 analysis rather than indulging in the current group slander campaign,” Laurie Ferguson 

 concluded
