 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. Hon Ian Macphee, MP

 BOAT ARRIVALS IN DARWIN

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee,  said today that initial investigations indicate that of the  persons who arrive in Darwin by boat, allegedly from Vietnam  some may not have come directly from Vietnam.

 "Intensive investigations are being carried out by a team of  officers to establish their true identity", Mr Macphee said.

 "I will decide the action to be taken when further reports  are received."

 "I am concerned to ensure that claims to protection and  assistance by any who may, in.fact,: be refugees are given  full and sympathic consideration", Mr Macphee said.
