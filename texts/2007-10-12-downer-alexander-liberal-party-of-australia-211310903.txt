 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   

 12 October 2007 

 Diplomatic Appointment - Ambassador to Mexico  Ms Katrina Cooper is to be Australia’s new Ambassador to the United Mexican States. Ms Cooper will  succeed Mr Neil Mules AO who has been Ambassador since March 2005. Ms Cooper is expected to  take up her appointment in January 2008. 

 Australia and Mexico enjoy close and strengthening relations. In 2006, Mexico was Australia's largest  trading partner in Latin America, with total two way merchandise trade reaching A$1.9 billion.  Australia has both a Double Taxation Agreement and an Investment Protection and Promotion  Agreement (IPPA) with Mexico. Also in 2006, both countries agreed to establish a Joint Experts’ Group  to investigate further enhancing the economic relationship. 

 Mexico is an increasingly attractive trade and investment destination for Australian companies in a  range of sectors, particularly energy. Australia exported coal worth A$ 418 million to Mexico in 2006  and there is good potential for significant LNG exports from Australia. Mexico has emerged as an  important exporter of motor vehicles and piston engines to Australia. Over 1,100 Mexicans enrolled at  Australian educational institutions in 2006. Australia’s Council on Australia Latin America Relations  (COALAR) has played an important role over the last six years in sponsoring visits by prominent  Mexican journalists and expanding cultural links between the two countries. 

 Mexico is an important partner for Australia in APEC, the WTO, the OECD and the UN and both  countries have agreed to work closely together on climate change issues. 

 Ms Cooper is currently Legal Adviser, International Organisations and Legal Division. Prior to this she  was Assistant Secretary, Domestic Legal Branch (2006-07). Overseas, Ms Cooper has served as  Counsellor in Port Moresby (2002-05) and Third, later Second Secretary in Santiago de Chile (1995-98).  In Canberra, Ms Cooper has held a range of positions including Director, Administrative and Domestic  Law Group (2000-01), Director, Biological Disarmament Unit (1999-2000). She also worked in the  Canada, Latin America and Caribbean Section (1993-94). 

 Ms Cooper holds Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees and a Graduate Diploma in Foreign  Affairs and Trade from the Australian National University. She speaks Spanish and French. Ms Cooper  is married and has two children.
