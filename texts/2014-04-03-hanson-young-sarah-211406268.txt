 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Thursday, 3 April 2014    

 Morrison’s mealy-mouthed Manus meeting  nothing more than a smokescreen     

 The refugee determination process that the Immigration Minister is setting up in PNG is nothing  more than a faÃ§ade designed to reject as many refugees as possible, the Australian Greens  have said.    

 “The Coalition’s scant regard for the safety of refugees was revealed recently when Tony Abbott  declared that most of those on Manus Island would be sent home,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Concerning statements like these have left the impression that any refugee determination  process established in PNG will be a sham.    

 “Saying that the majority of asylum seekers are economic migrants who don’t deserve  protection shows just how broken and prejudiced this system already is.    

 “The Abbott Government is treating PNG like a colony, bribing them with foreign aid money to  achieve domestic political outcomes.    

 “Australia should be caring for refugees, not dumping them on our poor regional neighbours.”
