 Offshore detention and border protection costs exceed $2bn: Greens 

 The 2012 Budget papers show the cost of the Australian Government’s inhumane off-shore asylum  seeker assessment program and border protection measures have ballooned to more than $2bn over  the next year alone, the Australian Greens said today. 

 Assessing asylum seekers off-shore will cost at least $1bn this financial year, against the $239m  outlined in the budget last year. Border protection will cost $1.1bn.  

 $709m will go to detention facilities on an already over-crowded Christmas Island, despite the clear  evidence it is far cheaper to assess claims on the Australian mainland. 

 “Last year the government intended to spend $113m on the island’s facilities, but now we’ve seen the  misguided plan to spend more than $700m alone this coming financial year,” Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “If the government wants to stop unrest in its detention centres, as well as save money, it should shut  down the Christmas Island centre and perform the security and health checks on the mainland. 

 “There’s also an extra $216 million dollars the Malaysian solution will cost Australian taxpayers,  although the deal breaches our international obligations and is simply trading in humans.”
