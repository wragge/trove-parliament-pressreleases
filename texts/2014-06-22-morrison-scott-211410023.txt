 The Hon. Scott Morrison MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection   

 Accidental drowning in Nauru  Sunday, 22 June 2014 

 This evening I received a report of two deaths on Nauru. We understand from initial  reports that the first deceased person was a private resident of Nauru, on a Nauruan  refugee visa, and was accidentally drowned. The person was not a resident at the  offshore processing centre. We understand the second deceased person was a  Nauruan citizen who we are advised passed away after attempting a rescue of the  first person. 

 We extend our sympathies to the families and friends of both of the deceased. Our  prayers are also with a further Nauruan citizen who we understand is receiving  treatment for injuries sustained during the attempted rescue. 

 This is a matter for the Government of Nauru as it pertains to an incident involving a  resident and citizens of their own country that occurred within their jurisdiction. 

 I understand that Nauruan Police are investigating the matter, which will become the  subject of a coronial inquiry. 

 Given these deaths will be the subject of coronial processes and the next of kin of  the deceased are yet to be informed, it would not be appropriate to go into further  detail at this stage.
