 ADDRESS BY 

 HIS EXCELLENCY MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC 

 GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 

 ON THE OCCASION OF 

 THE PRESENTATION OF THE 2006 ETHNIC BUSINESS AWARDS 

 SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE, NEW SOUTH WALES 

 14 NOVEMBER 2006 

 

 ·        Mr Joseph Assaf, Chairman, Ethnic Communication and Mrs Angela Assaf  ·        Your Excellencies  ·        Federal Ministers and Members of Parliament  ·        Distinguished guests  ·        Award finalists and sponsors    

 Thank you Mr Assaf for your warm welcome.    

 How fitting it is that this awards ceremony is being held in the Sydney Opera House.     

 Planning for this building began in the late 1940s when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW  State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions.  Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier, Joseph Cahill, who launched a design  competition.    

 Of the 233 entries received, that of the Danish architect, JÃ¸rn Utzon, was accepted.    

 The construction of the Opera House was one of the longest contractual sagas of the 20th century.    

 We now, quite rightly, regard this beautiful building as a masterpiece. It is an iconic architectural  symbol of Australia.    

 The point will not be lost on this audience that the creative force behind the design was a person  from outside Australia and from a non-English speaking background.    

 And what of that other monumental project of the last century, the Snowy Mountains Scheme?  Australia owes so much to men and women from the 32 countries who laboured to complete it and to  fulfil the grand vision of those who conceived the Snowy project.    

 Engineers and technical staff were in short supply in 1949 when a New Zealander, Sir William  Hudson was chosen to head the Snowy. He began at once to 'search the world' for skilled workers  and found numbers of them in refugee camps in Europe - indeed some had fought against one other  during the Second World War.    

 Hudson imbued in them a superb esprit de corps by extolling the overriding importance of the  project in which he said: 'You aren't any longer Czechs or Germans, you are men of the Snowy'.     

 One doesn’t need to participate in such grand projects as the Snowy or the Opera House to make a

 difference; tonight’s finalists prove that. They are all people who believe passionately in their work - whether it be patchwork, stationary or antipasto! Indeed they contribute significantly to Australia’s  reputation as a “Nation of Excellence - the Global Example” - wonderful people possessing multi-lingual capacity, proven technical skills, business acumen and outstanding leadership.    

 Ladies and gentlemen. The Ethnic Business Awards is Australia’s longest running business awards  program - now in its 18th year. Let’s give the Award’s creator, Mr Joseph Assaf, a well deserved  round of applause for his drive and vision.    

 The Awards celebrate the significant contribution of migrants to Australian business, and  acknowledge stories of success, vision, struggle, integrity, common sense, and ultimately, of people  investing in Australia and its community.    

 I was interested to read the award selection criteria for companies, including, overcoming cultural  and language barriers, the use of innovative technology, employment creation, and displaying  potential for growth and improved financial performance.     

 I understand that the calibre of entries in 2006 was extremely high. From cheese making to coffee  farming, educating to quilting, concrete contracting to cleaning services, the finalists are an eclectic  mix who reflect the essence of the Awards - diversity in industry and ethnicity.    

 As we know, each year Australia benefits from billions of dollars generated from mineral resources  and agricultural enterprises. What is not so well known are the economic benefits, also estimated to  be in the billions, deriving from the multilingual skills of our population. With 43% of our people  either born overseas or with at least one parent born offshore, and with some 240 languages between  us, we have one of the world’s most cosmopolitan and language rich populations. It seems to me that  bilingual Australians will play an increasingly important role not just in business, but in developing  and enhancing political and cultural linkages between nations.    

 Meaningful and properly understood communication across national and cultural boundaries is  growing in importance; indeed the ability to speak with others in their own languages will lead to  less likelihood of misunderstandings in a troubled world.    

 Ladies and gentlemen. In business, devising strategic plans, driving export development, finding new  markets, managing staff and taking commercial risks - indeed all the nitty gritty of running an  enterprise - requires outstanding leadership.    

 It’s the sort of leadership which has brought Australian companies to their present high point. The  businesses represented this evening have contributed to that success by balancing concern for task,  quality and productivity, with concern for people, relationships and morale.     

 So well done to all involved.    

 Ladies and gentlemen. I wish the thousands of businesses established across Australia by people who  were born overseas, every success in playing their critical role in progressing our country as a  “Nation of Excellence - the Global Example”.    

 Marlena and I extend to them and to the 2006 Ethnic Business Awards finalists every good wish for  the future.    

 Thank you.
