 Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 Scott Morrison 

 106 days since last successful people smuggling venture 

 Friday, 04 April 2014 

 The latest update from Operation Sovereign Borders reveals another week has  passed without a successful people smuggling venture reaching Australia, Minister  for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison said today. 

 A total of 106 days, or more than 15 weeks, have now passed since the last  successful people smuggling venture made it to Australia back on 19 December  2013. 

 Operation Sovereign Borders, under Lt-Gen Campbell's leadership, is continuing to  work as intended to stop the boats, save lives at sea and restore integrity to our  refugee and humanitarian programme. 

 The government is now moving into a third phase of Operation Sovereign Borders -  following the initial establishment phase and the 100 day period without a successful  venture to Australia. 

 This phase will ensure that the intensity of all operations in all areas of Operation  Sovereign Borders is maintained, across offshore processing, operations at sea and  through disruption and partnership operations all the way up through our region, all  the way back to source countries. 

 Anyone who seeks to come illegally to Australia or run a venture in the next hundred  days will find the same set of policies that stopped all those coming over the last  hundred days. 

 The government will also continue to engage with the region in continuing to pursue  regional partnerships and arrangements. 

 This week also saw the first Joint Ministerial Forum to oversee implementation of the  Regional Resettlement Arrangement. The Forum reiterated that all persons  transferred to Papua New Guinea under the RRA who are found to be refugees will  be resettled in PNG and no-one found not to be a refugee will be transferred to  Australia.
