 LABOR MUST ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT OCEANIC VIKING DEAL 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 In the latest extraordinary development in relation to the special deal granted to the asylum seekers on the 

 Oceanic Viking, it has been revealed that the Australian Government charted a plane to bring four people with 

 adverse security findings against them from Indonesia to Australia.  

 The four have subsequently been refused visas after ASIO determined them to be a threat to national security.  

 The Labor Party must now explain to the Australian people how this has been allowed to occur and they must 

 now finally come clean about the special deal granted to the asylum seekers onboard the Oceanic Viking.  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Michael Keenan has called on the Government to answer some basic 

 questions.  

 “When did the Government become aware that these four represented a security threat - before or after they 

 brought them to Australia?  

 “If the Government was aware that these four represented a security threat - why did they charter a plane to 

 bring them from Indonesia to Australia?  

 “If the appropriate background checks had not been done then why were they brought to Australia?  

 “Will the Government guarantee that any person deemed a security threat will not be granted a visa to enter and 

 settle in Australia?  

 “Either the Government was aware of the security threat posed and still organised to bring the asylum seekers to 

 Australia or they organised to bring people to Australia without doing the appropriate checks,” said Mr Keenan.  

 “Either way Labor needs to come clean about how this was allowed to happen.”
