 AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF CRIMINOLOGY

 People Smuggling: An Australian Perspective

 Paper presented by

 Rebecca Tailby, Australian Institute of Criminology

 Australian Federal Police College, Canberra Management of Serious Crime course

 28 June, 2000

 Introduction:

 You’ve all heard by now some general information on people smuggling, and the range

 of motivating factors that both push migrants from their home countries and pull them to

 more attractive destination countries.  To begin my discussion, I want you to ask

 yourselves why some people might want to come to Australia, and why they might

 choose not to use legal means.

 There are a number of reasons why Australia is an attractive destination for many people

 from overseas:

 - we have relative stability in our economic and political systems and have a

 democratic government, which is attractive to those coming from most of the

 smuggling source countries where there is usually a high degree of political instability

 and/or government control (eg. Afghanistan, Iraq, China) or a weak economic climate

 (SE Asian countries), and possibly war and public oppression

 - the perception of the Australian lifestyle is one of laidback prosperity and opportunity

 in a beautiful country

 - Australia has a higher international profile given the upcoming Olympics, both as a

 tourist destination and as a potential source of work opportunities

 - we are a multicultural society

 - There are strong migrant networks in place in most major centres around Australia

 which many new migrants can link into to facilitate their settlement into Australia

 - Australia survived the recent Asian economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific region

 relatively unscathed, yet other SE Asian countries suffered.  This led to a surge in

 people smuggling activities in and from these regions, including increased illegal

 movement from/through these countries to Australia.  This was partly facilitated by

 financial cuts to policing in those countries which meant a lowered capacity of law

 enforcement to prevent such activities

 3

 (i) Why?

 To understand why people might try to enter Australia illegally and place themselves into

 the hands of smugglers, it helps to understand the legitimate options for migration

 available and why these might not be used.

 Migration

 Australia has a legitimate migration program whose intake is strictly controlled.  In 2000-2001 the intake is planned for 70,000 in the migration and family program and 12,000 in

 the humanitarian (refugee) program.  The migration program emphasises skilled

 migration and family reunification.

 Many potential migrants don’t, or can’t, satisfy the competitive skilled migration

 requirements.  Alternately, some may not wish to endure what they see as a protracted,

 complicated and expensive migration process (eg.if they wish to work only for a short

 period in Australia then return home).  Others may be unable to engage in legitimate

 migration procedures due to political, economic or social factors in their home country.

 There are also environmental factors operating in Australia that help create a market for

 undocumented migration.  There is a demand in Australia (as well as in other countries)

 for cheap, non-regularised labour in various sectors by employers who want to maximise

 profits.  There are many individuals who are willing to be smuggled into our country to

 fill this demand, to get work here even if it means they are underpaid and are in the

 country illegally, as it may be better than any opportunity they have in their home country

 and it may enable them to remit money to their relatives back home.

 (ii) Who?

 For these and other reasons, some people resort to illegal methods to enter, live and/or

 work in Australia.  In summary, there are 3 groups of people seeking to enter Australia in

 an unauthorised manner:

 4

 1. Those who have bona fide protection needs (ie legitimate refugees), but who try to

 circumvent Australia’s entry and migration rules

 2. Those who claim to have protection needs who have protection elsewhere (forum

 shoppers)

 3. Those who have no need for protection, but merely seek to come here illegally

 (ERG on People Smuggling in Australia : December 1999)

 The circumstances surrounding illegal entry to Australia can vary, and unauthorised entry

 to Australia is typically described in terms of smuggling and/or trafficking:

 a) Human smuggling = where a person gains entry into a country without the necessary

 permission, whether or not for profit

 b) Human trafficking = recruitment, transport, or receipt of persons at any stage in the

 migration process through deception or coercion, for the purposes of prostitution,

 other sexual exploitation, or forced labour (UN 1999).  Trafficking may or may not

 involve a smuggling aspect

 As a rough figure, around 90% of cases of illegal entry to Australia constitute smuggling,

 with trafficking into Australia being relatively rare.

 Of those entering illegally, many just want to come here to live and start a new life, and

 escape horrendous conditions in their home country.  But there are others who come here

 with the express intention to work and make money.  Methods by which migrants can

 enter Australia and work illegally include:

 i) apply for tourist visa with unstated intention of looking for work and/or

 overstaying their visa

 ii) attempt entry on fraudulent travel docs

 iii) attempt to avoid detection by entering by sea clandestinely

 (iii) How serious is the problem in Australia?

 Although people smuggling into Australia is an important issue and requires continuing

 efforts to combat, within the global context we are not targeted by smuggling syndicates

 5

 as strongly as are other potential destination countries such as the US and Canada, the

 UK, and other affluent countries in Europe.

 Although the IOM estimated in 1996 that 4 million people are moved illegally around the

 world each year, with the worldwide proceeds of people smuggling at $7-11 billion per

 year, the number of detected illegal entrants to Australia annually numbers only in the

 thousands.  Although this may sound comparatively small, within our own context the

 number of illegal arrivals to Australia has shown an alarming increase over the last

 couple of years, particularly the number of boat arrivals.

 The impact of people smuggling on Australia is significant in a number of ways:

 - the average processing cost of an illegal arrival who enters Australia’s refugee system

 is $50,000

 - estimated costs in the 99-00 year to the Australian Government locating, removing

 and detaining people who have arrived in Australia illegally and/or those found

 working illegally is $196 million

 - If illegal entrants go on to work illegally, they are taking work from Australians and

 circumventing Australia’s tax requirements thus creating a greater financial as well as

 jobloss burden on Australia

 - given the human rights abuses often accompanying people smuggling, this is an issue

 of grave concern which should not be diminished merely by a smaller scale of the

 problem seen in our country

 - In the last Federal Budget, the government allocated millions of dollars to build

 Australia’s investigation and compliance capacity to combat people smuggling,

 increasing money to DIMA, Customs, AFP and NCA - this shows the commitment of

 Australian government to tackling issue of people smuggling, with the grant of

 money reflecting the seriousness of this issue

 (iv) How do they get here?

 Myth #1: main illegal migrant problem is illegal boat people

 6

 Reality: the largest number of interceptions in Australia by Immigration authorities are

 migrants who enter legally then overstay their visa and work illegally.  This may be

 relatively easy for illegal migrants as citizenship and work rights are not frequently

 assessed before hiring, and many will find “under the table” work in unregularised

 sectors.  The second largest group of illegal migrants are those who are intercepted at

 airports either because they are travelling on false documents or they intend to work in

 contravention of their visa.  The third group after this is illegals intercepted by sea, who

 mainly come with no documentation, many of whom come seeking to claim refugee

 protection.  Eg. in 98-99, 13,485 overstayers were located in the community, compared to

 2,106 unlawful arrivals by air, and 926 unlawfuls by sea.  Note however that over recent

 months, the number of sea interceptions has skyrocketed and exceeded that seen by air.

 One difference is in patterns: by air, the illegal inflow trickles in with a few passengers

 per day; by sea it comes in hits, ie. a boat per week, with some boats carrying up to 200-300 illegals.  I’ll talk more about this when I go on to Trends in a few minutes.  Before I

 do this I’d like to say a few words about the smugglers.

 (v) Who brings them here?

 Organised Crime

 Increasingly, transnational organised crime groups (TOCGs) are implicated in people

 smuggling operations.  Involvement of TOCGs in people smuggling is part of a global

 trend. OCGs function like any business ie.their motivation is profit, and they operate on

 business principles like taking up market opportunities and so on - the difference being

 that the markets they exploit are criminal/prohibited.  People smuggling is seen as a low

 risk, high gain activity capable of generating huge profits for organisers which can then

 be used to finance further operations.  Furthermore, people trafficking is even more

 profitable than smuggling, as trafficked migrants may be coerced into committing further

 criminal acts for the OCG once smuggled into the destination country, thus raising further

 revenue in addition to their smuggling fee.

 7

 Involvement of TOCGs in human smuggling and trafficking is particularly concerning

 from a human rights perspective.  Those desperate to come to Australia may agree to pay

 large amounts of money to organisers (up to $40,000 in some cases), and particularly

 with boat travel may ultimately get a journey in extremely poor on-board conditions. The

 risks of boat travel remain high, with up to 220 boatpeople drowning in April this year

 when their boat sank off Christmas Island.

 Once in Australia (if indeed the boat makes it, as many are unseaworthy) smuggled

 individuals may be virtually enslaved into debt bondage to organisers, given that they are

 unable to pay off the large smuggling debts straight away.  They may be placed in virtual

 slave labour, commonly in restaurant, sweatshop, agricultural and sex work industries.

 The link between people smuggling and trafficking is particularly close for female

 migrants given their greater vulnerability. The ability of trafficked persons to escape

 debt-bondage conditions are limited by many factors, including:

 - OCGs often take their passports and ID papers

 - due to their illegal status in the country, victims are unwilling to approach law

 enforcement authorities to report human rights abuses

 - OCGs may use extreme violence as a form of control and to secure payment from

 trafficked victims and their families

 (vi) Trends in smuggling into Australia:

 Looking at this graph of unauthorised arrivals to Australia over the past decade, a number

 of trends are apparent:

 i) the overall number of illegal entrants to Australia has steadily increased over

 time

 ii) air arrivals have increased steadily over the past decade

 iii) boat arrivals have fluctuated, and for the most part have numbered fewer than

 the number of air arrivals

 8

 Source : DIMA

 In the last 12 months, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of

 unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia.  The number has jumped from under 1000 in 98-99, to 4174 in 99-00.  This is far above the number of air arrivals for 99-00 which was

 1694.

 Smuggling into Australia is growing in terms of its size and sophistication of methods

 used.  For instance, boat-wise, on 1 November 1999, a large boat with 352 people on

 board arrived at Ashmore Reef.  Recent cooperative action overseas disrupted the

 planned illegal voyage of a ship from Somalia to Australia carrying up to 2000 would-be

 illegals.  Air-wise, document mills exist both overseas and locally that manufacture

 fraudulent travel documents for use by those entering by plane, eg. false passports or

 visas.  The sophistication of these fraudulent papers is increasing, thanks in part to

 involvement of organised crime groups in setting up highly sophisticated counterfeiting

 mills.

 9

 As I said before, unauthorised arrivals by air have been increasing steadily over the past

 decade.  DIMA officials intercept unauthorised persons at our airports on a daily basis.

 Over the past 6 months, the most frequently recorded illegal passengers citizenships for

 those intercepted at Australian airports were: Malaysian, Korean, New Zealander, Indian,

 Filipino, Chinese, Iraqi, Sri Lankan, Thai and British.  By far the most frequently used

 transit airports serving as last points of embarkation were Singapore and Kuala Lumpur

 airports.  Over half of unauthorised air arrivals during 98-99 landed at Sydney airport.

 Illegal entry by air tends to trickle, eg. there may be one or two illegals on a flight here

 and there.

 On the other hand, unauthorised boat arrivals have fluctuated, with the already

 mentioned surge during the last 6 months, mainly from Iraq and Afghanistan, many of

 whom have been smuggled here by highly organised criminal elements.  Almost half of

 unauthorised boat arrivals land at Ashmore Reef.  In terms of the boats used to smuggle

 people to Australia, they range from small fishing boats (typically from Indonesia)

 through to large steel-hulled ships capable of transporting hundreds of passengers.

 An interesting distinction which can be made with regard to boat arrivals is between

 boats which are highly likely to be found, and those wishing to enter undetected.  A

 majority of boats enter Australian waters to the North-West, with many landing at

 Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island where they are almost certain to be found by

 Coastwatch or Navy boats.  Passengers are then bought to the mainland and placed in

 detention.  However, there have been some spectacular cases of attempted clandestine sea

 arrivals where boats have used new routes to enter Australia.  A new route by sea was

 noticed in 1999 where boats from PRC landed on Australia’s east coast, with boats

 coming down through PNG, or out further east to come in above NZ.  These East coast

 interceptions have all involved Chinese nationals.

 Eg. Operations Dandenong and Bronte at Scotts Head intercepted 60 Chinese nationals

 Op. Kosciosko at Jervis Bay intercepted 83 Chinese

 Op. Quin at Broken Bay intercepted 112 Chinese.

 10

 There has been a strong law enforcement response to these attempted East coast landings,

 with surveillance increased along the coastline, and the last East coast interception was in

 mid 99.  However, Australia’s east coast (from Qld to Vic) could still be a high risk area

 for smuggling boats entering clandestinely.  Landings will tend not to be at major ports

 (due to high visibility and law enforcement monitoring capacity).  At isolated sites,

 Customs and DIMA are unlikely to have a local presence, thus local police are likely to

 be the first law enforcement contact for these illegal migrants.

 Information about signs of possible smuggling operations on remote ie.non-major coastal

 areas:

 - hire of boats by persons who don’t appear to have a plausible reason

 - boat activity suggesting people being ferried to shore in a remote area

 - accommodation rental in secluded areas near the coast capable of housing a large

 group without plausible explanation

 - cash hire of buses and/or unusual vehicle activity in remote coast locations

 - concealed campsites/food storage on beaches

 - small groups of people (especially of Chinese or Vietnamese appearance) wishing to

 visit remote areas who don’t appear to be tourists, who ask unusual questions (eg

 about remote boat landing places)

 Alternately, police officers stationed in major cities may come across unauthorised

 entrants after their arrival to Australia, eg. after they have been smuggled in, when they

 have moved into the larger metropolitan centres like Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane to

 hide and work within the larger migrant community.

 Current risk of boat influx:

 There have been reports in the press that about 1500 illegal immigrants are waiting in

 Indonesia to hitch a boat ride to Australia and that Australia can expect more boat arrivals

 now that cyclone season is over.  Indonesian authorities report that almost all of these

 persons are well-educated and with access to money.  However, it appears that illegals in

 11

 Indonesia were having trouble finding skippers for the fishing boats due to tougher

 sentences handed down recently to Indonesian skippers caught smuggling to Australia.

 Australia’s response to human smuggling and trafficking

 a) Legislation

 â¢ Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Act 1999 (Cth) - with

 proposed State legislation to come

 Creates new statutory offences of :

 - slavery

 - sexual servitude

 - deceptive recruiting

 ie. targets victims of trafficking, particularly those in sex industry

 Commonwealth law targets these activities with an international connection.

 â¢ Organised people smuggling under Migration Act (Cth)

 There are offences relating to unlawful entry to Australia and also organising illegal entry

 of others into Australia.  Recent amendments to the Migration Act increase penalties and

 create new offences with respect to people smuggling:

 - Maximum penalties for people smuggling are now 20 yrs imprisonment, and/or

 $220,000 for an individual ($1.1 million for a corporation)

 â¢ Anti-organised crime legislation - the NCA

 The NCA was established under Commonwealth legislation in 1984, with specialist

 investigative powers in relation to relevant offences which covers the activities of OCGs.

 Proceeds of Crime Acts (Commonwealth and State) deprive people involved in organised

 crime of their profits.  Given the primary object of OCG involvement in people

 smuggling is profit, it is hoped that this legislation will act as a strong deterrent and

 prevent the reinvestment of criminal profit into further crim activities.

 12

 b) Law Enforcement

 Three main agencies have law enforcement responsibilities relevant to people smuggling

 and trafficking into Australia.  These are DIMA, ACS and Police.

 DIMA

 DIMA is tasked with managing the movement of people into and out of Australia.  The

 department has programs directed to the lawful and orderly entry and stay of people,

 settlement of migrants and refugees and their acquisition of citizenship.  I’ll let the DIMA

 speaker go into detail about compliance activities, and will just quickly mention that the

 government’s preventative role against illegal workers is met in large part by DIMA

 initiatives including an overseas information campaign to discourage people trying to

 enter Australia to work illegally, and proposed sanctions to be introduced to discourage

 employers from recruiting illegal workers

 Customs

 ACS facilitates the movement of people across the border, including processing

 passengers at Australian border entry points and coastal surveillance to detect and deter

 unlawful activity.

 Police

 Both the AFP and State and Territory police enforce the criminal law and protect

 Australia’s national interests from crime.

 Relevant to smuggling and trafficking of human beings is the role of police in:

 - enforcing the Migration Act and the Crimes Act Part IIIA - Child Sex Tourism (this

 is the AFP’s jurisdiction)

 - countering and investigating organised and transnational crime

 - investigating criminal activities in general, which can include criminal acts by those

 in Australia illegally

 - acting cooperatively with other agencies in tackling illegal entry to and operations

 within Australia

 Activities relevant to people smuggling/trafficking include:

 13

 - arrest and charging of persons involved in people smuggling

 - investigation of persons under Part IIIA Crimes Act (Child Sex Tourism)

 - intelligence gathering

 - overseas liaison officers

 - international liaison through Interpol

 - cooperative assistance activities in Asia-Pacific region including training of overseas

 law enforcement eg. in intelligence work

 JAWES

 (Joint Agency Waterfront Enforcement Sydney)

 - this is a group containing representatives from AFP, NSWPol, ACS, Fisheries,

 AMSA, EA, Water Police, who have regular intelligence-sharing meetings between

 agencies dealing with maritime issues.

 International cooperation

 Australia is an active participant in international for a that consider the issues of

 smuggling and trafficking in persons, such as the Asian Regional Initiative against

 Trafficking in Women and Children and the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia

 Pacific.  Minister Ruddock attended the international Symposium on Migration in

 Bangkok in April 1999, where the Bangkok Declaration on Irregular Migration was

 adopted.  This document attends in particular to regional cooperation on

 irregular/undocumented migration.

 Australia’s HREOC is represented on the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights

 Institutions.

 Australia is party to several international conventions relating to trafficking in persons,

 including:

 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of

 the Prostitution of Others

 1957 ILO Convention concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour

 14

 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

 1996 Programme of Action of the UN Commission on Human Rights for the Prevention

 of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others

 Australia is actively participating in the negotiations surrounding the preparation of the

 new Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its optional protocols, two of

 which are expressly devoted to combating smuggling and trafficking of persons.

 Australia is also party to several MOUs with respect to the sexual abuse of children, eg.

 MOU between Australia and Philippines outlines procedures to be followed in cases

 where a minor applies for a visa to travel to Australia without their parents/guardians.

 Australia is giving Indonesian authorities money to assess the status of immigrants prior

 to their departure for Australia, and hundreds of middle eastern nationals have been

 intercepted and detained in Indonesian immigration detention centres to prevent their

 illegal passage to Australia.

 Locally, services for trafficking victims are generally provided by State and Territory

 governments, and/or NGOs.  DIMA also provides a range of immigrant services,

 including financial assistance, referral, health services and accommodation, as well as

 assistance and advice regarding immigration procedures.

 Economic assistance

 Provision of economic assistance to source countries for illegal migrants is likely to

 provide a partial long-term solution to human smuggling/trafficking.  Australia’s

 international aid program assists Asia by addressing root causes of disadvantage and

 poverty.  Projects aim to facilitate sustainable economic development and deliver basic

 education, as well as provide support services for victims of trafficking.  Most are funded

 through AusAID.

 15

 Research and Data collection

 The  Australian  Institute  of  Criminology  (AIC)  is  currently  taking  part  in  the  Global

 Program  Against  Trafficking in  Human  Beings,  launched  by the  United  Nations  Office

 for Drug Control and Crime Prevention in March 1999.  The Program consists of policy-oriented  research  and  targeted  technical  cooperation,  in  relation  to  smuggling  and

 trafficking  in  human  beings.   AIC  is  providing  research  expertise  to  this  international

 project, and is collaborating with a multinational research team.

 The AIM of the UN Global Program is to better understand the phenomenon of

 trafficking in humans, with a view to assisting governments to improve their criminal

 justice responses to trafficking, particularly as it relates to the involvement of organised

 criminal groups.

 The program recognises the growing global trend towards greater organised crime

 involvement in people smuggling, and aims to bring to the forefront the involvement of

 these groups, and promote the development of effective and collaborative criminal justice

 responses to these problems. The Global Program will collect data on different routes for

 smuggling and trafficking human beings, and the structures and modalities used for

 transporting and subsequently exploiting them. A global inventory of best practices used

 in addressing organised crime involvement in smuggling and trafficking, including

 special legislation and institutional arrangements, will be created.

 In  close  cooperation  with  respective  governments,  non-government  organisations  and

 other institutions, a series of “demonstration projects” will be run in selected countries.

 The demonstration projects will assist governments in:

 â¢ Counteracting  groups  involved  in  human  smuggling  and  trafficking,  including

 TOCGs.

 â¢ Strengthening  crime  prevention  strategies  against  the  smuggling  and  trafficking  of

 humans.

 16

 â¢ Improving  victim  witness  protection  and  victim  assistance  for  victims  of  human

 smuggling and trafficking.

 The  processes,  impacts,  and  possible  side  effects  of  the  demonstration  projects  will  be

 evaluated.  By  the  end  of  the  three-year  Program,  a  global  strategy  against  human

 smuggling  and  trafficking  will  be  formulated  and  presented  for  adoption  by  the

 international community at a global forum.

 The AIC is providing research expertise for the first pilot project of the Program, known

 as “Coalitions Against Trafficking in Human Beings in the Philippines”.  It is expected

 that  this  Project  will  serve  as  the  model  for  future  United  Nations  projects  on  human

 smuggling and trafficking.

 At  present,  a  rapid  assessment  has  been  completed  on  the  Philippine  situation  and

 research  is  currently  in  phase  2.   This  phase  involves  collecting  data  from  NGOs  and

 experts  in  the  Philippines  who  provide  services  to  or  have  knowledge  about  victims  of

 smuggling and trafficking, as well as gathering information from government and police

 agencies.  The survey which is currently being developed by myself and the rest of the

 research  team  aims  to  assess  a  number  of  factors,  focusing  particularly  on  the  role  of

 organised  crime  groups  in  the  trafficking  process.   Areas  of  enquiry  include  the

 demographics  of  smuggled  and  trafficked  persons,  costs  and  debts  associated  with

 smuggling  services  including  debt  mechanisms,  smuggling  routes  and  methods,

 exploitation of trafficked persons, return and assistance to victims, recruitment trends and

 practices, deception/coercion of victims, other associated criminal practices (eg.document

 fraud), criminal profit margins on people smuggling, level and nature of organised crime

 involvement,  connivance  and  corruption  of  officials,  coordination  between  NGOs  and

 government in assisting victims of trafficking.

 It  is  hoped  that  by  systematically  and  comprehensively  gathering  information  on

 smuggling  and  by  providing  this  to  government  and  police,  law  enforcement  agencies

 will be in a more informed position and will be able to use evidence to make operational

 decisions regarding how to best target resources.

 17

 CONCLUSION

 Human  smuggling  and  trafficking  are  matters  of  increasing  concern  to  the  Australian

 government.  Recent interceptions of vessels attempting to smuggle people to Australia,

 as  well  as  the  number  of  attempts  to  enter  by air  on  fraudulent  travel  documents,  have

 highlighted  the  increasing  sophistication  of  people  smuggling  operations,  and  the

 involvement of organised crime groups in this activity.

 Remembering that OCGs are driven by market forces, a sensible approach to curbing the

 problem of people smuggling is to create market barriers at all stages: at the supply level

 through imposing and publicising tough penalties on suppliers of smuggling services, in

 trafficking through better interdiction efforts attacking both major players and support

 structures (aided by better intelligence, more awareness among officials, and sting

 operations), and at demand stage by improving conditions in source countries (eg.by

 foreign aid) and through education campaigns alerting potential migrants of dangers.

 These actions will help disrupt existing markets and retard the development of new

 markets.  Market risk can be increased through legal changes, more effective law

 enforcement and imposition of tougher penalties.  Prosecutions of smugglers may be

 facilitated by the provision of witness protection and special care programs to victims

 that help encourage cooperation with law enforcement as well as protect victims.

 Clearly, policing plays a vital role in meeting many of these objectives.

 In summary, Australia has met many of these goals through legislation and various

 policies to address the issues of human smuggling and undocumented migration

 generally.  It is likely that these will have ‘flow-on’ effects to minimise the incidence of

 human smuggling to Australia and to assist victims of trafficking.

 Human smuggling and trafficking are, however, transnational activities.  As such, they

 cannot be stopped by the activities of one country alone.  Domestic efforts to stem the

 activities of smugglers and traffickers will have little effect without the cooperation of

 origin and transit countries.

 18

 Furthermore, hopefully the preceding discussion has highlighted the multi-jurisdictional

 issues within our own country - persons entering Australia illegally and their subsequent

 illegal activities render them persons of concern to agencies ranging from DIMA,

 Customs, and Federal Police (who have specific duties under Federal legislation to

 apprehend illegal immigrants) through to Quarantine, the Tax Office, Centrelink, Health

 Department, NCA as well as State and Territory Police to name a few.  All of these

 agencies may come into contact with persons who have entered Australia illegally, and

 where this is suspected should inform relevant authorities.  Furthermore, these agencies

 are likely to be sources of intelligence which could help other agencies in their own

 investigations.  Open communication and information-sharing can be extremely valuable

 in helping move investigations forward and ensuring that the integrity of Australia’s

 systems, be it the migration system, the justice system, the health system, the

 employment or tax system, is maintained.
