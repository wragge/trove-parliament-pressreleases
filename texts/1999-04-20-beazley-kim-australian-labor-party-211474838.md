  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, EXECUTIVE BUILDING, 
BRISBANE, 20 APRIL 1999

  

  SUBJECTS: Mal Colston, GST, East Timor, CARE workers

  

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, is it disheartening that Ron Boswell has 
so enthusiastically welcomed Senator Colston back to the Senate this 
morning?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, yes it is. What Senator Colston should be doing 
is retiring from the Senate. He should have done that some considerable 
time ago. He should do it now. If he is not going to do that, he should 
vote with the Party on whose ticket he was elected when he was elected 
to the Senate. And he should not vote to impose on Queensland a tax 
whose job destroying effect will be most emphatic in Queensland, and 
whose effect on all Australians is going to see middle income Australians 
carry the tax burden and the poor and the pensioners not properly compensated.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Does it indicate to you, though, that perhaps some 
sort of deal or close to some sort of deal’s been done between the 
Government and Senator Colston?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 That’s always on the cards. But we’ll have to 
wait to see the outcomes on that as to whether Senator Colston has any 
genuine independence.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Have you spoken to him or has anyone in the Labor 
Party spoken to him today?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, I haven’t spoken to him. I won’t be speaking 
to him. Senator Colston knows his obligations.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is a GST inevitable now?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I don’t think there’s anything inevitable about 
it but if it, does go through it will be a very bad day for this country.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Well, what chance have you got of pulling it up?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  We’ve got 28 votes out of 76. We have pointed out to people repeatedly 
that once these things go through they get set in concrete. And that 
puts a great deal of press ure on the minor parties. We will vote 
against this absolutely. We’ll vote against amendments to it to maximise 
the pressure of the minor parties to vote against the lot, because no 
part of the GST is acceptable. And we are not in any way confident, 
but we hope that all the parties in the Senate that are looking at this 
will have seen the pretty horrific evidence that has been presented 
to the various GST committees in the Senate, and they’ll vote accordingly.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Has that confidence being shaken further in the last 
24 hours?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Has it been shaken?

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Less than ...

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I would think you’d find that the evidence that’s 
been given by the Treasury, the evidence that’s been given by the 
independent consultants, the repeated evidence that’s been there from 
the charities and those with an interest in what’s happening to Australian 
families, I mean, if that actually doesn’t get through to you, then 
virtually nothing will.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What’s Indonesia going to make of Howard, Downer 
and Moore going over there next week?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, look, this has to be the start, not the end, 
of the diplomacy, as far as this is concerned. This is a matter of vital 
interest to Australia. It’s a matter of vital interest on two fronts. 
Firstly, because we have humanitarian concern that this chance for a 
genuine act of self-determination for the people in Timor should not 
be missed. And, also, as a long term friend of Indonesia, that this 
set of circumstances in which they now find themselves, and the successful 
outcome or otherwise in this set of circumstances in Timor, is going 
to determine attitudes towards Indonesia in Europe, Japan, in the United 
States, for many years to come. The Prime Minister unguardedly over 
the weekend said you could see why this wouldn’t be a focus for them 
because there’s only 800,000 people in Timor and there’s 200 million 
Indonesians. Well, there’s no other trouble in that much-troubled 
chain of islands that is going to impact so dramatically on Indonesia’s 
international standing as the situation in Timor. It’s very vital 
for all Indonesia that there’s a decent outcome there. Now, we have 
a major problem and the major problem is this: these militia have been 
armed. They’ve been armed by the Indonesian military. The Indonesian 
military know who has those guns and they’ve got to get them off them. 
And the killing that’s gone on has to come to an end right now. It 
should never have started. It has to come to an end right now. And John 
Howard’s task and Alexander Downer’s task is to engage in what, 
in old fashioned terms, used to be called shuttle diplomacy, the sort 
of thing that the previous Labor Government did in Cambodia. This is 
not any longer a matter for statement of good opinions. We can all have 
good opinions. What we have to have now is an intense diplomacy and 
Mr Howard’s efforts on Bali must be that start of that. It doesn’t 
matter even if there’s, you know, a good statement produced between 
President Habibie and Mr Howard when that occurs. Good statements are 
useful but, in the end, until there is that act of self-determination 
for the Timorese people and an end to the violence, nothing is achieved.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is there any role over there for you?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 No, there isn’t a role for Oppositions except to 
put pressure on governments. That’s the role of Oppositions and that 
is what we intend to keep doing, as far as this is concerned.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Fraser and those two CARE Australia workers, that 
sounds good, does it?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Yes, I was delighted to see Malcolm Fraser’s press 
conference this morning. I though that sounded to me like an important 
development. And I wish him godspeed in all his efforts, as far as that 
is concerned. We had our own announcement today, not as far as those 
two Australians are concerned, we just support all efforts that are 
there to secure their release and the dropping of the totally unjustified 
charges. But, in terms of the refugees that are now in Albania and in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, we had Senator Schacht there 
the other week and he discovered, when he was in those camps, that one 
of the key human concerns that they had was an inability to get in touch 
with family elsewhere in Europe and between camps to make the linkages 
again. They’ve had to leave so fast from their dwellings in Kosovo 
that they just simply haven’t been able to establish that sort of 
contact. And Senator Schacht had his mobile phone, which has got world 
wide roaming, and he’d just given it to a 12 year old girl who’d 
contacted her dad in Germany, and that was the first her dad knew that 
mum and the girls were actually out and all right. It was a very moving 
thing for Senator Schacht and he rang me up and said, ‘well, will 
you get hold of Telstra and get them to get some phones into the camps 
and an ability to use the calling’. And so we did. And I’m very 
pleased to see that today Telstra’s responded. They’re going to 
give credit up to $10,000 for the value of the phone calls that will 
be made from the camp and Ericsson, who are their partner, are going 
to give half a dozen mobile phones - which is, I think, about what CARE 
Australia wanted - to CARE Australia so that in the CARE camp in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia they’ll have these phones to 
enable the families to establish contact. That’s half the battle there 
- the cruel, vicious conditions of the exit of these poor folk from 
Kosovo who have left them without that basic human contact. And their 
fears about leaving the area to take up the offerings of refugee places 
elsewhere have basically been driven by the fact that those families 
have not re-established contact with one another.
