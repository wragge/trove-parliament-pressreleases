 Update on the Escape of Woomera Detainees

 Doorstop Interview, 30 March 2002

 Philip Ruddock: I understand you have a number of questions but I thought this afternoon I might just take a moment to fill you in on the background of the people who are still at large.

 Initially there were 50 escapees, 36 were located, some of them returned of their own volition or gave themselves up to the police. Those that are at large are Afghan or Iranian. I think there's seven of each aged between 19 and 30. There may be a number over 30 but certainly under 40 years of age.

 When I looked at the profiles I think only one is still awaiting a primary decision. There are, I think, another couple, one who had an RRT remit, which means that a decision had been adverse that had been remitted for a further review. There is one who has exhausted all remedies and the balance would be 11 who have matters before the full Federal Court or the Federal Court.

 So this population of escapees reflects very much the pattern of people that we are detaining right now. Eight hundred of the 1,600 people we are detaining are people who have no further matters before the courts or before tribunals. Everything that has to have been considered has been the subject of very detailed consideration.

 The bulk of the detainee population reflect what we've seen at Woomera, people who still have matters before the courts or before the Refugee Review Tribunal but the important point is they are people who have had claims considered and they have been found not to be refugees.

 I see a lot of comment from time to time, particularly from those who are perhaps not dealing with these issues all the time, that these are refugees or asylum-seekers. They are nothing of the sort. They are, if you wanted to use a term that was, I suppose, apt, it might be a rejectee. They have had claims. They've been considered and they've been found to be wanting.

 That's not surprising because today is the fifth month in which there have been no boat arrivals from Indonesia in Australia, the fifth month in which there have been no boat arrivals and the very reason we have very few people who have outstanding asylum issues to be addressed in detention is because we haven't had boats for that length of time.

 So really that's the only observation I wanted to make. Are there any questions you wanted to put to me?

 Question: Have you any idea where they've gone?

 Philip Ruddock: I can only surmise, as the police have suggested, that if they've been in the process of

 being smuggled out, that has probably not been highly likely. I mean their concern at the moment is that people have headed into the desert areas and that there is a possibility that people could be in a very vulnerable situation. And the concern that the police have expressed is that people were being providored with survival rations, were being providored with small amounts of water and a change of clothes and if they've been simply set loose into the desert they could be very vulnerable, which would be a matter of very real concern.

 Question: What will happen to those people who are found guilty of harbouring these people or helped them escape?

 Philip Ruddock: First of all, you have to have the evidence and that's always a matter that requires detailed consideration by police at first instance and by the Director of Public Prosecutions. If there is evidence to go before a court and they are found guilty, I understand the penalties associated with harbouring can be between four and 10 years penal servitude depending upon which provisions of the Crimes Act are used.

 Question: And what happens to the people who fled, once they've been caught?

 Philip Ruddock: The issues are the same. First of all, you have to have evidence to sustain a prosecution so you have to have evidence of the escape and there would be the full range of factors that would have to be looked at, including intention and if there was sufficient evidence to found a successful prosecution the penalty in the Migration Act for escaping lawful detention is a maximum penalty of five years jail.

 Question: You mention that all of their avenues of appeal have been rejected. What would have happened to them if they hadn't escaped, if they were still there?

 Philip Ruddock: The Iranians, when all avenues have been exhausted, are available for return and a large number of Iranians have already returned but others are withholding cooperation in the view that it may either keep them here longer or give them a migration outcome. That won't happen.

 In relation to the Afghans, again it's a question of the basis upon which their claims are rejected. I suspect that most Afghan claims have been rejected because a view has been formed that they are dealing with Pakistanis and there's a good deal of evidence and community information to suggest that already in the existing cohort of even temporary protection visa holders there is a significant proportion of fraud where people were able to sustain claims that couldn't be disproved and where community information is suggesting that we're dealing with a Pakistani cohort.

 Question: Minister, have you got an idea of how many of the Afghanis have taken up your repatriation offer?

 Philip Ruddock: The offer has been formally outlined but it hasn't been put to any of the Afghans yet. The reason is that we want to have a clear view of the arrangements to facilitate return. We've had certain discussions with the Afghan Interim Authority in which they've indicated that people can be returned but some of the logistical arrangements still have to be finalised. When those matters have been dealt with, then the formal offer will be put.

 Question: Is it true that some refugees are facing bills of up to $100,000 on leaving the detention centres?

 Philip Ruddock: It is certainly the case that people who aren't refugees are billed for detention costs and if they're removed from Australia those costs would have to be recouped before people are allowed to return and that is part of the normal arrangements for dealing with some of the costs that we have to incur for people who have no lawful entitlement to be here.

 Question: Is that a new policy?

 Philip Ruddock: No, it's not.

 Question: How will you be getting the money back from these people that are going? They don't have a lot of money.

 Philip Ruddock: The costs are recouped in those situations where people have an aspiration to be in Australia. We don't recover all costs. We might like to but we don't.

 But where we do recover it is where people who have been here, sometimes in the workforce working contrary to visa conditions, they're apprehended, they take their time, they use the legal proceedings, they're still found not to be entitled to be in Australia - the claims might be refugee status, they may be any number of other claims - they're found to be wanting, they're removed and then they may have had a relationship with an Australian and they want to come back and that's frequently the sort of circumstance in which find that we're able to recoup the costs.

 Question: But how? Whose money? Are you taking the Australian person that might have had the relationship with them or- -Philip Ruddock: If people want to be able to come to Australia in this situation, they need to discharge

 their debt and people make arrangements to discharge their debt. I've had to discharge debts occasionally. I've sometimes had to go to the bank to get the money.

 Question: Minister, how do you react on a personal level when you see pictures of eight-year-old girls fleeing, presumably from their families, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours?

 Philip Ruddock: I don't think that's a correct assumption, is it? Presumably from their family? I mean, I'm not sure that's the circumstance. As I understand, a number of people left the detention centre in the melee that occurred and a number of those people were recaptured. I understand there was a family group.

 I don't intend to go any further in terms of identifying the family group but there was a family group that absconded and that they were, it is said, found in a camper van in the desert and presumably they came together. I don't know that there was any suggestion that the family members had behaved to each other in a way which forced some to abscond and not others.

 Question: Do we know if that little girl who was pictured yesterday had fled by herself or had she fled with her family? What is the story with that?

 Philip Ruddock: I don't know and I don't know whether the picture was of the particular family I have in mind but from some of the reports I've read - and that's all I can go by - there were periods of time in which members of the family group were with different protesters in different parts of the camp and that they were linked later on. But you said they were running away from their family. I'm not sure that that's a correct description of what has happened.

 Question: You don't know otherwise, though.

 Philip Ruddock: No, I don't. No, I don't know and perhaps we'll never know.

 Question: But if it emerged that this young girl had fled from her family that would be a terrible state of affairs, wouldn't it?

 Philip Ruddock: Let me just make this point. One of the reasons that we entered into certain agreements with the State Family and Community Services Department in South Australia, for them to be able to make professional assessments about children in detention, is so that if parents do not fully accept their parenting responsibilities and it's not in the best interests of a child to remain in a detention environment

 with parents as part of an intact family unit, those professional assessments could be made and those decisions taken and those are matters that we've always expected would be looked at on a case by case basis.

 The only point we've made is that if the professional judgments have always - which they have been, I might say - that children ought to remain as part of intact family units and it's preferable that that occur in detention rather than people or family groups be separated so that some are in detention and others are not, the view they have taken is that it's preferable for them to remain intact.

 Question: But the possibility here is, isn't it, that a young girl, life is so bad a young girl is prepared to be separated from her family?

 Philip Ruddock: There are suggestions from time to time that - I might say this has not been found in relation to the population of Woomera - but there have been suggestions from time to time that parenting skills can be so poor that state authorities recommend separation. That does happen but at Woomera, with the South Australian authorities, no decisions have been taken in the best interests of children for that to occur.

 Question: So you're suggestion is the young girl would be fleeing bad parents rather than a bad camp.

 Philip Ruddock: I don't know what suggestion you are making. What you're suggesting is that in relation to family groups where decisions have been taken that they're not refugees, and where they're being held for removal, that the girl didn't want to be with her family. That was the suggestion. Now, I don't know that. I can't comment on it.

 I can only say that there have been no findings by state authorities to suggest that they are of the view that any children should have been removed from their parents and usually the reasons that they form that view is because parents have inappropriate parenting skills to be able to properly care for them in that environment.

 Question: Can you say how many protesters have been arrested?

 Philip Ruddock: I've heard various figures. I don't know the precise figure.

 Question: Happy with state-federal police relations and cooperation?

 Philip Ruddock: The only point I'd make is that there were very elaborate discussions last week before these demonstrations in which the relevant authorities worked through the various contingencies and who would act in relation to the specific circumstances. I don't, in any way, resile from what I've said in relation to this matter. I think that given that there were very clear understandings that the federal personnel that were available - I think the APS had 50 people and ACM were dealing with the detainees -that if there were breaches of the peace, if there was trespass on Commonwealth property, Defence lands, that those issues would have been dealt with the police. And initially they weren't. Later they were.

 And I simply asked the question whether - because these things were said to be operational - I simply asked the question whether it was an operational decision or a political decision and I still don't know the answer to that but it's quite clear that the police were able to manage those issues when they had a mind to.

 But they didn't initially intervene and it was said to be operational. Now, I notice that the State Minister, commenting on these matters and questioning why I've raised these issues, said that he understood that the operational issues hadn't been worked through. Well, he was just wrong. The operational issues were worked through last week with the relevant authorities, the state police, ACM, as the detention authority, and APS, and I saw regular updates on the results of those meetings as they worked through the various issues and the various contingencies that might have to meet.

 And certainly on the advice that was available to me, there was an expectation that when the initial breaches occurred, of the perimeter, a kilometre away, that steps would have been taken at that point in time to contain it. It wasn't. Now, I don't know the reason it wasn't. It was an operational issue.

 I don't know on what basis that operational decision was made but let me just conclude by saying, in making those observations I make no criticism whatever of the professionalism of the police who have undergone a great deal of very unnecessary trauma and anxiety and hurt, physical hurt. I mean, people shouldn't have to go to work each day and be assaulted - I mean, you've got one policeman with a broken foot, as I've heard - you shouldn't run the risk of being brutalised by makeshift weapons and the intention of the demonstrators always was clear.

 The information was broadcast on radio in South Australia last Thursday that they were taking weapons in one form or another, implements, tools, for the purposes of giving those items to detainees. That's what they said they were going to do and that's what they did.

 Now, the police respond as always very properly to these matters. My questions have been in relation to the operational orders and how they came about given what I understood to be the clear understandings that were reached as to when particular steps would be taken.

 Question: Are you saying there was pressure from the Government on the police to- -Philip Ruddock: No, I'm not saying anything about that. I'm simply saying I don't know whether these were operational decisions that the police took themselves or that they had some other orders. I don't know but what I am saying is there were clear understandings through the course of last week as to how each body would act, the numbers of personnel that would be deployed and where their responsibilities specifically lay and it was quite clear that in holding 800 people, and the estimates were that there would be 700 to 800, maybe 1,000 people coming - that's what they planned for - that with that number of people there, that the containing of them was not something that APS could do alone. That was quite clear.

 Question: Refugee advocates say that detainees inside Woomera are now being mistreated. They've not only been put into solitary confinement but shackled and handcuffed?

 Philip Ruddock: Detainee advocates are saying. We're not dealing with refugees. These are people who have been rejected.

 We're dealing with a very small proportion of the population and this idea that you can use terms like refugee advocates, that give them some legitimacy when they behave as they behaved, and when they break out of lawful custody, and when they have been through a process and their claims, in large measure, have been found to be wanting, and yet you want to build them up as some group of people that we should be treating as heroes, belies the situation we're dealing with.

 We have people who have been injured. Seventeen detention officers injured. They don't deserve to go to work and to be put through that. Now, we don't have a capacity for what you describe as solitary confinement. We do not have cells and the only times in which people might be put into what are called flexicuffs, might be to move people for a particular reason or to constrain people where they refuse to behave appropriately.

 I'm not saying that may not have happened but I am saying that there is no capacity for what you describe as solitary detention in Woomera.

 Question: But are these not desperate actions of desperate people that are at their wits end? They haven't got any other options?

 Transcript: Update on Protests at Woomera and Villawood Detention Centres.

 Philip Ruddock: If desperation is born out of a desire to achieve a migration outcome that you're not entitled to, we're dealing with desperate people.

 Let's understand what we're dealing with here. We have a group of people who go out there to release people who are lawfully detained, to breach our laws, they take children with them and they hold themselves out to be fulfilling some public duty, under the name of "There are no borders" or like euphemisms.

 These are people who take the view that anybody from anywhere in the world has an entitlement to come to Australia and that we have no entitlement to protect our borders and decide who is going to settle in Australia and on what basis. I mean, that's what it's about.

 Question: Does that warrant them being handcuffed and shackled though?

 Philip Ruddock: If people refuse to obey lawful instructions, if they're likely to be assaulting people or refusing to behave appropriately, there are times when they have to be subjected to some restraint and that's always been a possibility but, look, go back to where we were.

 You've had people who have torn down internal fences, who have damaged property, have assaulted staff, who have fashioned weapons out of palisades, weapons that can do quite serious injuries to people and what you're saying is that those who are faced with people who are prepared to do that should have no capacity to be able to manage it. That's what you're saying.

 All right?

 Question: Where to, now, Minister? It's winding down. What are you going to do inside and what are you going to outside?

 Philip Ruddock: The issues are quite clear. We're dealing with people who, in the main, will be removed from Australia, when we're able to do so and we will retain them until we're able to do just that and we detain people humanely but they have no entitlement to believe that inappropriate behaviour is going to alter the outcome.

 Question: Will you be looking at deportation rather than a jail sentence for those who have been involved in the incidents over the weekend?

 Philip Ruddock: It's not a question of what I do. And if there are matters of a justice issue that have to be dealt with, whether it's people's entitlement to bring actions before a court themselves or an obligation to be before a court because proceedings have been brought before them, then we ensure that they remain available for those matters to be properly dealt with.

 But in terms of when people should be removed, there are a lot of variables and they include the variable of when we're able to obtain appropriate documentation and to be able to move people.

 Question: It's been almost three days since the Friday riot. Should we have seen a faster clean-up of the escapees by South Australian police?

 Philip Ruddock: I think the South Australian police have done a first class job and I make that point again and I think they suffered unnecessary injuries and my comments about the operational orders under which they were working should in no way reflect upon the police who were carrying out their duties and their responsibilities.

 And when you're dealing with a group, a very large group of people who are intent on concealing people, harbouring them, then it's not surprising that there may be some who might, for a time, abscond but I'm

 sure in time we'll locate them.

 Question: How hopeful are you that you're going to pick up the last 14 that are on the run?

 Philip Ruddock: I am, I must say, impressed by what has happened before. When authorities- -Question: The Villawood incident- -Philip Ruddock: Villawood was a different issue because you're in a large city where there's been a

 capacity for people to conceal and harbour, that is to commit offences and we believe that many of those people were removed from Australia. We found a number of them in New Zealand.

 We've also found some of those people have actually been caught interstate and just to give you an idea of the nature of some of those people - I haven't seen any Sydney press covering it recently but it has been covered in the West Australian newspapers - two people who were the subject of escapes there are on charges in Western Australia involving the stealing of large amounts of money in which some of it had been remitted overseas. I think something of the order of $300,000 stolen from people's letterboxes in the forms of cheques, illegally cashed, and those funds remitted.

 I mean, we're dealing with people in many circumstances in detention who are being removed from Australia because they have been involved in criminal activities as well.

 Thanks very much.
