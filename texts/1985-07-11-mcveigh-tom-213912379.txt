 MEDIA RELEASE 11 JULY 1985

 OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON TRADE HOW. TQM MCVEIGH M . P . 

 OPPOSITION WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FOR TRADE COMMISSION

 The Federal Oppovltlou lia» withdrawn 1L« »upyvr L vl the Governmentfa  proposal to set up an Australian Trade Commission.

 Opposition Spokesman on Trade, Mr Tom McVeigh said while the  Opposition supported the concept of rationalising the disparate  elements of the Trade portfolio, it did not support the manner  in which the Government was structuring the Commission.

 " My initial concern that an inappropiate structure could turn the  Commission into an administrative nightmare of epic proportions is  now confirmed.

 The Opposition is particularly concerned that: * no specific areas of improvement or major differences in operations  have been outlined to demonstrate a tangible improvement in  co-ordination resulting from the changed structure * there is no review of the Commission's effectiveness envisaged * EPIC will still be a separate legal entity in Sydney * the OPC will still be a separate legal entity based in Sydney . * most departmental publicity which is currently being handled in 

 Melbourne will continue to be handled in Melbourne, although the  Minister's office and the Department gave differing advice on this  matter '* although it will have a substantial Budget allocation the formal 

 lines of ministerial responsibility and accountability have been  removed >

 * there is an expectation that the more positive aspects of public  service employment will be maintained, such as the public service  superannuation and right of re-entry to the public service should  the individual be dismissed from the Commission

 " The 'one stop trade shop' is no more than a side-stepping,  re-shuffling of bureaucracy, Mr McVeigh said.

 " There is no commercial operations base, all Commissioners will be  Government appointed and the potential for abuse has been created  through removing Ministerial responsibility and accountability.

 " The Opposition calls on the Government to remove the 6 person  departmental team currently in charge of setting up the new  Commission.

 Mr McVeigh said the Minister should immediately appoint an  independent team of management consultants, with a proven record  in the area of public service management problems, to determine  how such a Trade Commission could be set up in a commercial  environment.

 " If the Government does not carry out such a move, the Opposition  upon its return to Government will commission such a study to see  what genuine rationalisation of the Trade portfolio could be  undertaken to make it more responsive to exporter's needs."
