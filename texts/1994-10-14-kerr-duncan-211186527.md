 MINISTER for JUSTICE The Hon. D unam  Ken M T  14 October 1994

 TRIBUNALS DISCUSSION PAPER - A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE

 The Minister for Justice, the Hon Duncan Kerr MP, today welcomed the release of a  discussion paper on the Commonwealth m erits review  tribunals by the  Administrative Review Council, inviting public comment on the effectiveness of the  federal merits review tribunals.

 Speaking at the annual review tribunals conference in Melbourne, the Minister said:

 "The Commonwealth's merits review tribunals provide an important means for  people to be able to challenge the correctness of government decisions which  affect them. In the nearly twenty years since the Administrative Appeals  Tribunal was set up, it and the other specialist tribunals have reviewed the 

 cases of tens of thousands of people"

 "I asked the Administrative Review Council to look at the whole system of  merits review tribunals to see if they are still effectively and efficiently meeting  the objective of providing a simple, affordable, timely and fair means of  challenging government decisions"

 "The Council's discussion paper is an important step in this review, and I hope  that everyone with an interest in the work of the tribunals, or in access to justice  more generally, will respond to the issues raised."

 The Council will present its final report to the Minister in May 1995.

 Administrative Review Council Discussion Paper:

 REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH MERITS REVIEW TRIBUNALS

 SUMMARY AND MAIN ISSUES

 Introduction

 The Administrative Review Council (the Council) is an independent statutory body  that advises the Commonwealth (Australian federal) Government on administrative  law matters.

 In December 1993, the Minister for Justice, the Hon Duncan Kerr MP, asked the  Council to undertake a comprehensive review of the Commonwealth system of  merits review tribunals.

 The Council will be reporting to the Minister for Justice by the end of May, 1995. A  Discussion Paper has been issued in September 1994. Public submissions are now  invited.

 The closing date for submissions is 23 December 1994. Submissions should be made  in writing to the Administrative Review Council at GPO Box 3222, Canberra ACT  2601. Please indicate clearly that the submission is in response to the Council's  Tribunals Review Discussion Paper.

 Responding to the Council's questions

 Throughout the issues chapters of the paper, questions have been posed, to assist  interested parties in making submissions. Only some of those questions have been  included in this summary document.

 The questions can usually be answered at two different levels -  in relation to specific  tribunals or agencies, based on particular experience, or more generally, based on  experience of more than one jurisdiction or knowledge of the overall system. Both  levels of response will be helpful.

 Don't feel you have to answer all the questions -  a response to just one question will  be welcomed as much as a comprehensive submission.

 Tribunals Discussion Paper - Summary and Main Issues 2

 Scope of the review

 People affected by a wide range of Commonwealth government decisions have the  right, by law, to appeal or challenge those decisions. A tribunal, independent from  the department making the original decision, can in many cases review the merits  and lawfulness of the decision.

 The Commonwealth's system of review tribunals is the most comprehensive in the  world, and is used by more than 20 000 people a year. The reviewing tribunal can  change or overturn the original decision.

 The focus of the review is on the main components of the Commonwealth external  merits review system These are: â¢ the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT); â¢ three specialist "first-tier" tribunals -  the Social Security Appeals Tribunal 

 (SSAT), the Veterans' Review Board (VRB), and the Student Assistance  Review Tribunal (SART) -  decisions of which can be reviewed by the AAT;  and â¢ two specialist tribunals with final m erits review  jurisdiction -  the 

 Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT).

 The AAT carries out first-tier reviews of a wide range of administrative decisions  specified under more than 260 statutes, as well as second-tier reviews of SSAT, VRB  and SART decisions.

 The review is not concerned with the many tribunals which have been established to  make primary administrative decisions (such as the National Native Title Tribunal),  or to enforce standards (such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity  Commission).

 Objectives

 The objectives of the review are: â¢ to assess the overall performance of the system of merits review tribunals; â¢ to identify strengths and best practice both within, and to the extent relevant,  outside the existing system; and

 â¢ to make recommendations for development and adjustment of the system to  enhance its performance.

 The review will also seek to identify ways in which specific tribunals can better meet  the standards appropriate to them, and any barriers to improvement.

 Recommendations in the final report may include administrative procedures and  practices, the exercise of statutory discretions or, where appropriate, legislative  amendments.

 EFFECT OF TRIBUNAL DECISIONS ON AGENCIES
