 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - BRISBANE CITY HALL, BRISBANE, 26th JANUARY 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Children in Detention

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean is this new policy a back flip for the Labor Party?

 CREAN: This is a constructive solution and a lasting solution to a problem that the Government hasn’t properly tackled.  A constructive solution that I hope the Government can respond to.

 JOURNALIST: …significant change of your policy …?

 CREAN: The current solution is not working we therefore need to change.  If things don’t work you have got to change approach and what I’m suggesting is that there is a need for change.  I suggest the start to that change which begins with the kids because I don’t think any circumstances can justify young children being behind razor wire.  If we can make the start by dealing with that problem then I think we can move on to deal with the other issues as well.

 JOURNALIST: The five point plan…?

 CREAN: The proposals that we are putting forward in the hope that we can get bi-partisan support.  I’m not about political point scoring with this - I am looking for lasting solutions.  And I am saying to the government of the day we need to find a lasting solution and I am prepared to work with you to achieve it.  I have put down the basis upon which I think this solution should be built and I look forward to working with the Government if they are prepared to work with us.

 JOURNALIST: Is this the appropriate forum for this kind of policy to be raised considering that those people inside aren’t voters and they are here for a celebration?

 CREAN: But they are citizens and they have come here in different ways to this country.  A number of them are refugees, a number from Afghanistan.  I think it is a forum where we celebrate what citizenship is, the advantages of immigration, the balance between process and compassion.  It’s the forum where the message about getting back to a bi-partisan support, getting back to a lasting solution is very appropriate.  We haven’t got that solution at the moment, we need it and this is a forum that can very readily digest and understand the significance of that message.

 JOURNALIST: Are you aware….that the detainees are outside …?

 CREAN: Look I have heard that there’s a lot of conflicting advice on that but my proposition today is to start with the kids.  Instead of bickering about what the claims are, let’s try, as a first step, to get the kids out from behind the razor wire and give them the opportunity that every other child in society expects and which the Australian nation of a “fair go” demands.  That’s what I am seeking as the first step.  If we can get goodwill out of that, I think we can address these other issues.  But we have got to make a start.  And the start is to do something about getting the kids out from behind the razor wire.

 JOURNALIST: Are the comments of Mark Latham …?

 CREAN: Look, that statement relates to old circumstances.  What I am putting forward today is a new proposition, a new proposition to start the process for a lasting solution.  And what I want is people of goodwill to come forward for that lasting solution.  Of course there will be differences but we have got to be prepared to sit down and work those differences through. Instead of finding the differences let’s find the common ground and the most effective place to start that common ground is dealing with the kids.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 CREAN: My family is always saying that I should be home a bit more so I think ...the last place to provide the environment for that.  But I think what the Lord Mayor was saying is that he is prepared to be part of a constructive solution that deals with the problems of the kids.  Now there have been trials about housing people outside the detention centres.  As far as I am aware those trials have been successful.  Why can’t we build on the trials?  Why can’t we look to where people are offering genuine opportunities. And as I see it, the Lord Mayor’s suggestion is one of those genuine opportunities and I thank him for it.

 Ends.
