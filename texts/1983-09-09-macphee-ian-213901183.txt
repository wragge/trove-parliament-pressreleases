 EMPLOYMENT. T H I S  GOAL HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN ACHIEVABLE 

 BUT THE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE S I X T I E S 

 CAMOUFLAGED SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS IN 

 MANUFACTURING AND WHEN THE WAGES EXPLOSION OF THE 

 EARLY SEVENTIES OCCURRED UNEMPLOYMENT WAS BOUND TO

 OF THE 1 9 6 0 ' S  THERE WAS " O V E R -F U L L "  EMPLOYMENT:

 THERE WERE MORE JOBS AVAILABLE THAN PEOPLE TO F I L L 

 THEM. I T  WAS COMMON TO F I N D  PEOPLE "MO ONLIGHTING" -

 TAKING SECOND JOBS, OFTEN IN FALSE NAMES TO PAY  

 LESS TAX OR BEING PAID IN CASH AND AVOIDING TAX.

 WILLING TO WORK WAS SAID TO BE A "BLUDGER" ON  

 SOCIETY, A TERM OF DISPARAGEMENT WHICH HAS OFTEN  

 BEEN APPLIED UNFAIRLY TO SOME INDIVIDU ALS IN THE LATER  

 RECESSION.

 I t i s  i m p o r t a n t  t o a c c e p t  t h a t  t h o s e  y e a r s  were

 ATYPICAL OF AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC PATTERN. MOREOVER,  

 THEY ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN SO AND THE COMPETITION  

 FOR JOBS IS LIKELY TO BE FIERCE FROM NOW ON.

 Ce r t a i n l y  t h i s  w i l l  be so for a s long  a s one can

 REASONABLY FORESEE.

 RELEVANT INFLUENCES FOR A LONG T IM E . FOR ONE TH IN G ,  

 THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT THAT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES  

 IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO  

 DECLINE, RELATIVELY IF NOT ABSOLUTELY. THE STRUCTURAL  

 CHANGES IN THAT SECTOR WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT  

 TWO DECADES AND WHILE A VIABLE INDUSTRY WILL REMAIN,

 I T  WILL REST INCREASINGLY ON CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN  

 NEW TECHNOLOGY. AS I T  HAPPENS, THE JOBS LOST IN TH IS  

 AREA TEND TO BE THOSE WHICH ARE LESS ATTRACTIVE EVEN

 3

 TO THOSE WITH VERY L IM ITE D  JOB CHOICES.

 I n a n y e v e n t , s e c o n d  or l a t e r  g e n e r a t i o n  Au s t r a l i a n s

 HAVE TRIED TO AVOID SUCH JOBS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES  

 THEY HAVE BEEN FILLED BY GUEST WORKERS OR ROBOTS AND

 i n  Au s t r a l i a  b y r e f u g e e s  and m i g r a n t s . Ea c h g e n e r a t i o n

 RESOLVES THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL GAIN THE EDUCATION  

 NECESSARY TO GAIN MORE SKILLED JOBS. THUS, THE  

 D IM IN IS H IN G  JOB PROSPECTS IN MANUFACTURING SERIOUSLY  

 AFFECT THE GENERATION NOW EMPLOYED BUT TEND TO  

 CONFORM WITH THE LACK OF INTEREST IN SUCH JOBS BY THE  

 NEXT GENERATION. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE IS  

 SOMETHING DISTASTEFUL TO MANY AUSTRALIANS IN ALLOWING  

 EACH WAVE OF REFUGEES OR MIGRANTS TO BE "FACTORY  

 FODDER", PERFORMING JOBS WHICH AUSTRALIANS PREFER  

 NOT TO DO THEMSELVES. I T  IS ALSO HUM ILIATING  FOR THE  

 NEW SETTLERS TO BE ASKED TO PERFORM BASIC FACTORY  

 ROLES WHEN MANY OF THEM ARE EXPERIENCED IN SOME OTHER  

 A C T IV IT Y  NOT RECOGNISED BY THE BODIES WHICH SET

 Au s t r a l i a n  q u a l i f i c a t i o n s .

 So, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, THE SCALING DOWN OF JOBS  

 IN MANUFACTURING WILL MEET EVOLVING SOCIAL ASPIRATIONS.

 Wi l l  enough  new j o b s  be c r e a t e d , h o w e v e r , t o m e e t

 THESE ASPIRATIONS?

 The a n s w e r l i e s  i n an a m a l g a m of p o l i c i e s , I n a p a p e r

 TAKING AWAY JOBS. THE FACT I S  THAT IMMIGRATION CAN 

 ACT AS A JOB STIMULUS BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED 

 DEMAND CREATED BY MIGRANTS. THE PRESENT NON- 

 DIS CRIMINATORY BUT HIGHLY SELECTIVE POLICY (WHICH IS 

 B I - P A R T I S A N )  SEEKS TO MA XI M IS E THAT DEMAND WHILE 

 S T I L L  HAVING REGARD TO FAMILY REUNION AND REFUGEE 

 OBLIGATIONS.

 We a l l r e m e m b e r t h e d i s a s t r o u s  25% a c r o s s- t h e- b o a r d

 T A R I F F  CUTS OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT WHICH, WHEN 

 COMBINED WITH EXCHANGE RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE 

 1 9 7 3 - 7 4  WAGE EXPLOSION CAUSED GREAT UNEMPLOYMENT 

 IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. LATER PROPOSALS TO 

 REDUCE PROTECTION HAVE INVOLVED GRADUAL ADJUSTMENT 

 SO THAT ANY DECLINE IN EMPLOYMENT MAY BE BALANCED 

 AGAINST JOB CREATION ELSEWHERE. SUCH PROPOSALS 

 HAVE ENVISAGED A PROCESS OF MANY YEARS FOR THAT 

 REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. I R O N I C A L L Y ,  THE PROTECTION 

 HAS OFTEN BEEN DIRECTED AT THE JOBS MENTIONED E A R L I E R ,

 THAT I S ,  TO SAVE THE D U L L , . R E P E T I T I V E ,  LESS SK ILLED 

 JOBS FOR THE MOST PART. SUCH JOBS HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY 

 HIGH LABOUR TURNOVER RATE. THUS, FEW I F  ANY 

 NEED LOSE TH EI R  JOBS; RATHER THE LABOUR FORCE MAY

 BE REDUCED BY A T T R I T I O N  -  NOT F I L L I N G  JOBS WHEN

 5

 VACANCIES OCCUR. TH IS IS  NOT ALWAYS ECONOMICALLY  

 POSSIBLE BUT HAS BEEN A TECHNIQUE OF MANAGEMENT  

 IN MANY COMPANIES FOR YEARS -  ESPECIALLY WHEN  

 INTRODUCING COMPUTER-RELATED TECHNOLOGY.

 Such an a p p r o a c h  n o t o n l y  a s s i s t s  s t r u c t u r a l  c ha ng e

 BUT ALSO HELPS TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE  

 REMAINING EMPLOYEES. NO ONE CAN HAVE ANY SENSE OF  

 LOYALTY TO A COMPANY WHICH SACKS PEOPLE ON AN HOUR'S  

 NOTICE.

 IN THIS CONTEXTv I WOULD l i k e  t o m e n t i o n  t h e  

 CURRENT ACTU JOB SECURITY CASE IN THE ARBITRATION

 Co m m i s s i o n . I t may b e o v e r s t a t i n g  t h e  p o s i t i o n  to

 SAY THAT TH IS  CASE IS A RESULT OF THE DETERMINED  

 REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYERS TO COME TO  

 TERMS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES' CONCERN OVER NEW  

 TECHNOLOGY. BUT, AS PROFESSOR Dl YERBURY'S STUDY  

 MAKES CLEAR, AUSTRALIA IS BEHIND ALMOST ALL  

 WESTERN COUNTRIES IN PROVISIONS FOR REDUNDANCY DUE  

 TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.

 6

 I NOTE WITH SOME CONCERN POINT 32 OF THE RECENT  

 MTIA STUDY INTO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTU  

 CASE:

 "None of t h e  ( 1 8 )  c o m p a n i e s  i n t e r v i e w e d

 BY US HAD ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIONS  

 OR THEIR EMPLOYEES AS TO PAYMENTS TO  

 BE MADE IN THE EVENT OF RETRENCHMENTS".

 IS I T  F A IR , IN THE LIGHT OF T H IS  STATEMENT, TO  

 SUGGEST THEY HAD NO AGREEMENTS ON OTHER ASPECTS  

 OF RETRENCHMENT -  SUCH AS LENGTH OF NOTICE -  

 WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES EITHER?

 I t IS THE WAY OF EMPLOYERS TO RESIST ANYTHING  

 UNTIL I T  IS IMPOSED FROM ABOVE. BUT EVEN I F  THE  

 EMPLOYERS "WIN" THIS CASE THE ISSUE WILL NOT GO  

 AWAY. A FAILURE TO ACT PO SITIVELY W ILL INEVITABLY  

 LEAD TO INCREASED GOVERNMENT OR TRIBUNAL INTERVENTION  

 IN AREAS OF TRADITIONAL MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVE.

 EFFECTIVELY AND FAIRLY IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL

 REDUCED BY IMPORTS IS REPLACED BY NEW DEMANDS IN  

 EXPORT AND DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES. T H IS  MUST BE  

 ACCOMPANIED BY WAGE MODERATION SO THAT EMPLOYEES  

 ARE NOT PRICED OUT OF JOBS.

 BUT IF  WE ARE TO L I F T  OUR GAME AND NOT BE THE POOR  

 RELATION IN THE A S IA N -P A C IF IC  REGION, WE MUST ALL  

 START TO THINK IN LONGER TIME-SCALES.

 An INSIGHT INTO TH IS APPROACH HAS BEEN GIVEN SEVERAL

 THAT MANY PEOPLE IN NEED REQUIRE FAR MORE ASSISTANCE

 I S  TO RETURN TO HIGH LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. MOST OF  

 THESE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN WELL RESEARCHED AND SOME  

 DETAILED REPORTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE READILY

 AVAILABLE.

 14

 One matter upon which relatively  l i t t l e  has been

 WRITTEN INVOLVES CHANGED PATTERNS OF WORKING. YET  

 I SEE THAT AS BEING OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE AS  

 THE YEARS PASS. A LESS R IG ID  APPROACH TO WORKING  

 PATTERNS CAN MEET THE INTERESTS OF THE INVESTORS  

 OF BOTH CAPITAL AND LABOUR AND ADD SUBSTANTIALLY  

 TO EMPLOYMENT IN THE PROCESS.

 The barrier to such progress seems to l i e in the

 NATURAL CONSERVATISM OF BOTH TRADE UNION LEADERS  

 AND THE MANAGEMENT OF MEDIUM TO LARGE CORPORATIONS.  

 THERE IS NO SUCH I N H I B I T I O N  ON THE PART OF THE  

 EMPLOYED OR THE MANAGEMENT OF SMALL ORGANISATIONS.

 TO REMOVE TH IS BARRIER, ONE MUST QUESTION THE RELEVANCE  

 OF SOME OF THE PATTERNS OF WORKING WHICH EVOLVED IN ,  

 MANUFACTURING. THESE MUST BE RE-EXAMINED BY  

 MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES.

 Trade unions in the rural and manufacturing  industries

 FOUGHT HARD TO WIN WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT  

 WHICH WERE OFTEN FAR AHEAD OF THOSE PREVAILING  

 ELSEWHERE.

 Those gains are a permanent  feature of the Australian

 SOCIO-ECONOMIC SCENE BUT, WHEN BLINDLY TRANSFERRED  

 TO AND RETAINED IN THE SERVICE SECTOR, THEY PRODUCE  

 R I G I D I T I E S  AND COSTS WHICH I N H I B I T  EMPLOYMENT

 GROWTH. For example, the notion of standard hours

 15

 OF WORK EACH WEEK IS AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL CONCEPT  

 AND IS ONE WHICH THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

 Au s t r a l i a n s  would  i n s i s t  on r e t a i n i n g . But

 WE DO NOT ALL HAVE TO WORK THE SAME 38 HOURS.

 And we s h o u l d  n o t e x p e c t  t o b e p a i d  o v e r t i m e

 MERELY BECAUSE WE WORK PART OF THAT 38 HOURS  

 OUTSIDE A TRADITIONAL PATTERN (SUCH AS 9 . 0 0  AM

 to 5 . 0 0  pm Mo nday  t o Fr i d a y ) .  Ov e r t i m e  i s

 OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE DEMANDED WHEN A WAGE-  

 EARNER WORKS MORE THAN THE STANDARD HOURS. BUT  

 THERE IS NO JU S T IF IC A T IO N  FOR THE ARGUMENT  

 THAT THE MERE WORKING OF THOSE STANDARD HOURS  

 AT WEEKENDS OR EVENINGS SHOULD OF ITSELF ATTRACT  

 OVERTIME OR PENALTY RATES.

 Ma n a g e m e n t  has a m a jo r  r o l e  t o p l a y  i n  a c h i e v i n g

 T H IS . A STARTING POINT IS IN THE GREATER EDUCATION  

 OF EMPLOYEES ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT AND  

 THE ESSENTIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COSTS, PR O FIT,  

 INVESTMENT AND JOBS. YESTERDAY' S PROFITS PROVIDE  

 TODAY'S INVESTMENT AND TOMORROW'S JOBS. MOREOVER,  

 PRICE INCREASES CAN BE A CONSEQUENCE OF DEMAND  

 FACTORS AND COST INCREASES, AND RARELY REPRESENT  

 A CAPACITY TO PAY INCREASED WAGES.

 HAS SHRUNK, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE WORKFORCE EMPLOYED

 16

 IN MANUFACTURING HAS DROPPED FROM 34% TO 18% IN  

 THE LAST DECADE.

 AS A RESULT OF INDUSTRIAL MUSCLE IN THE MANUFACTURING  

 AND BUILDING INDUSTRIES, 38 HOURS A WEEK IS NOW  

 STANDARD THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. SOME COMPANIES  

 WORK EVEN LESS AND PRESSURE IS MOUNTING FOR A 36  

 HOUR WEEK (AT 40 HOURS RATES OF PAY AND IN ADDITION  

 TO WHATEVER OTHER IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE OBTAINED IN  

 WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT),

 The r e s u l t  of t h e s e  d em a n d s  can o n l y  be t h e  f u r t h e r

 DECLINE OF OUR MANUFACTURING. AND AS INCREASED

 CLEAR AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, THE RECORD OF THE

 PRIVATE SECTOR IS LIKELY TO BE MORE CREATIVE IN ALL

 FROM PRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT ARE BOTH REWARDING AND

 AT A SATISFACTORY RATE. LOCAL PRIVATE INVESTMENT WILL  

 NOT BE DIRECTED TO RISK OR VENTURE CAPITAL BUT RATHER

 THEY ARE S T IL L  RELUCTANT TO PUBLICISE THEIR  

 ACHIEVEMENTS AND, AS A RESULT, MEDIA ATTENTION IS  

 OFTEN ON THE P R IM IT IV E  FACE OF CAPITALISM (JUST AS  

 I T  IS OFTEN ON THE THUG ELEMENT OF THE TRADE  

 UNION MOVEMENT). MOST IN S T ITU TIO N S  HAVE THEIR UGLY

 OF THE INDUSTRIAL FENCE EXERT PRESSURE ON THEIR LESS  

 RESPONSIBLE PEERS THE LESS WILL BE THE NEED FOR  

 GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE AND THE BETTER W ILL BE THE  

 OUTCOME IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH.

 IN THAT REGARD I T  WOULD BE USEFUL I F  EVERY POLICY  

 OF GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS AND TRADE UNIONS WERE  

 ACCOMPANIED BY AN EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT.

 21

 At the least we would all be better informed  and

 AT BEST THOSE MAKING DECISIONS WOULD ACTUALLY  

 HAVE TO GIVE THOUGHT TO THE EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF '  

 THEIR P O L IC IE S . I T  WOULD BE ILLUMINATING TO  

 SEE A GOVERNMENT'S ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT OF ITS  

 POLICIES AND HAVE COMMUNITY RESPONSE AFTERWARDS.

 Lik e w is e , i t would be in str u ct ive  for the

 COMMUNITY TO SEE PROFITS AS INVESTMENT AND AS  

 JOBS, AND WAGES NOT ONLY AS INCOMES BUT AS COSTS  

 JEOPARDISING JOBS, WHERE SUCH WAS THE CASE.

 MUCH OF THE INVESTMENT, OF COURSE, W ILL BE IN  

 TECHNOLOGY. VOLUMES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON TH IS  

 SUBJECT AND I T  MAY BE DEALT WITH HERE QUITE B R IE FLY .

 Technology is a major tool for pr o d uc tivity

 IMPROVEMENT. I T  WILL LEAD TO SOME LOSS OF SK IL L  

 BUT WILL CREATE A DEMAND FOR NEW S K IL L S , OFTEN  

 IN THE SAME OCCUPATION CATEGORY (FOR EXAMPLE, IN  

 THE PRINTING INDUSTRY). I T  WILL LEAD TO AN  

 IDEN TIFIABLE LOSS OF JOBS -  OFTEN IN BORING,

 ARDUOUS, DIRTY OR DANGEROUS OCCUPATIONS -  BUT WILL  

 ALSO CREATE A MASS OF NEW JOBS, FREQUENTLY IN  

 OCCUPATIONS WHICH WOULD NOT EVEN BE CONTEMPLATED  

 BUT FOR THE TECHNOLOGY.

 Technology solves some problems but creates others. 

 Despite  the catchy slogans, technology  is never the

 MASTER BUT THE AID OF MANKIND. I T  IS ENRICHING THE

 22

 QUALITY OF L IFE  IMMEASURABLY.

 But i t  i s  i t s  c a p a c i t y  t o im p r o v e  p r o d u c t i v i t y  w h i c h

 IS ITS GREATEST ASSET. THE FRUITS OF THAT  

 PRODUCTIVITY ARE SHARED BY THE COMMUNITY. WHETHER  

 ON FARMS, IN FACTORIES, SHOPS OR O FFICES, PEOPLE  

 WORK SHORTER HOURS FOR HIGHER WAGES THAN AT ANY  

 TIME PREVIOUSLY. THROUGHOUT HISTORY THE PEOPLE  

 WHO DERIVED GREAT JOB SATISFACTION WERE THE  

 PRIVILEGED FEW -  PEOPLE LIKE THE CRAFTSMEN WHEN  

 COMPARED WITH THE LABOURER. SO I T  HAS BEEN AND WILL  

 CONTINUE TO BE.

 Th er e  i s  no d o u b t  t h a t  t e c h n o l o g y  can p l a y  a m o st

 IMPORTANT PART IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF WORKING  

 LIFE IN TERMS OF SAFETY, HEALTH AND JOB SATISFACTION  

 (WHEN PART OF A THOUGHTFUL JOB REDESIGN PROGRAM).

 But t h e r e  i s  e q u a l l y  no d o u b t  t h a t  t h o s e  who work

 PRIMARILY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS (AND NOT FOR JOB  

 SATISFACTION) WILL WELCOME THE EVENTUAL REDUCTION  

 IN WORKING HOURS WHICH TECHNOLOGY W ILL ACCORD THEM.

 The c h a l l e n g e  f a c i n g  t h e m , t h e i r  c o- w o r k er s  and

 MANAGERS IS HOW TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY ENOUGH TO  

 ENABLE THEM ALL TO ENJOY A HIGHER STANDARD OF L I V I N G .

 Wh a t i s  im p o r t a n t  i s  t h e  r a t e  o f c h a n g e . I n Au s t r a l i a ,

 THE VERY SUCCESSFUL ADJUSTMENT TO TECHNOLOGICAL  

 CHANGE ON THE WATERFRONT PROVIDES A SPLENDID EXAMPLE.

 SUCH AS THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THE CRAWFORD COMMITTEE

 t o t h e  Fe d e r a l  Go v e r n m e n t  o f Au s t r a l i a  i n  1 9 7 9  would

 GREATLY AID THE HARMONISATION OF CHANGE: THE

 RATIONALISATION OF THOSE A C T I V I T IE S  WHICH CANNOT  

 BE AS COMPETITIVE AS THEY ONCE WERE AND THE CREATION  

 OF NEW INDUSTRIES WHICH ARE SO COMPETITIVE, I T  IS  

 RESPONSIBLE AND ONLY FAIR FOR GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE  

 COMMITMENTS A DECADE AHEAD REGARDING THE PHASING  

 DOWN OF PROTECTION AND THE CONTINUATION OF P O S IT IV E  

 FORMS OF ASSISTANCE WHICH ENABLE THE BEST PERFORMERS  

 TO BE INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE. AS THEY OPERATED

 i n  Au s t r a l i a , t a r i f f s  o f t e n  s e e m f d  t o b e g e a r e d  t o

 THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR WHEREAS, FOR THE MORE

 24

 EXPORT-ORIENTED, THE FORMS AND LEVELS OF P O S IT IV E  

 ASSISTANCE OFTEN HAD AN AURA OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

 THEM. For example, at various times i t was

 ALLEGED THAT EXPORT INCENTIVES OR THE STOCK  

 VALUATION ADJUSTMENT WERE BEING ABUSED. THE ANSWER  

 IN THE EYES OF THE GOVERNMENT SEEMED TO BE TO  

 ELIMINATE THE ABUSE BY ABOLISHING THE BENEFIT.

 Sadly, the Crawford Committee  Report was not

 ADOPTED FULLY BUT ITS APPROACH IS MOST IMPORTANT  

 FOR LONGER TERM PLANNING -  WHETHER BY THOSE  

 INVESTING THEIR LABOUR OR THEIR CAPITAL. I T  

 URGED A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN PROTECTION AND THE  

 EXISTENCE OF A PACKAGE OF ASSISTANCE IN WHICH THE  

 MIX MIGHT VARY BUT THE TOTAL WOULD REMAIN CERTAIN  

 ENOUGH TO AID THE BETTER MANAGED COMPANIES TO  

 COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST IMPORTS AND ON  

 EXPORT MARKETS.

 The approach of the Crawford Report remains

 VALID AND SUCH A PROGRAMME -  OVER A DECADE -  

 SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS BINDING ON SUCCESSIVE  

 GOVERNMENTS. THAT WOULD DO MUCH TO CREATE THE  

 CLIMATE IN WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN MAKE  

 REALISTIC DECISIONS ABOUT ITS INVESTMENT. THAT  

 DONE, GOVERNMENT, TRADE UNIONS, EMPLOYERS AND  

 TRAINING INSTITUTIONS CAN DEVISE TRAINING AND  

 RETRAINING PROGRAMS RELEVANT TO THE SKILLS WHICH  

 WILL THEN BE REQUIRED. IN SUCH AN APPROACH,

 25

 MARKET FORCES DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE  

 AND GOVERNMENTS FACILITATE AND ACCELERATE CERTAIN  

 CHANGES TO THE NATIONAL ADVANTAGE,

 One of the most v it a l  forms of assistance  is

 PROVIDED BY INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 grants. Australians  have been quite in novative

 BUT TOO OFTEN HAVE NOT CAPITALISED ON THEIR  

 INVENTIVENESS BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF VENTURE  

 CAPITAL AND POOR MARKETING. GREATER COOPERATION  

 BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS  

 NEEDED TO OVERCOME THAT WEAKNESS AND CREATE  

 NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS A RESULT.

 Leaving manufacturing , the challenge  of change is

 ALSO GREAT IN SERVICE INDUSTRIES LIKE BANKING,  

 INSURANCE, RETAILING AND THE RANGE OF TO UR IS T-  

 RELATED INDUSTRIES. CURRENTLY THERE IS LESS  

 IMPORT COMPETITION THAN FOR MANUFACTURING AND A  

 SLOWER RATE OF CHANGE BECAUSE OF THAT. BUT THE  

 NATURE OF CHANGE IS NO LESS S IG N IF IC A N T  FOR THE  

 INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TO CHANGE FROM A MANUAL  

 INVOICE FLOW TO A COMPUTER-CONTROLLED ONE, FOR

 example. Fortunately  for such employees , senior

 MANAGEMENT FOUND I T  AS HARD TO ADJUST (THOUGH THEY  

 WOULD NOT ADMIT IT )AND, THEREFORE, THE RATE OF 

 INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY WAS NORMALLY SLOWER,  

 DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF IMPORT IMPERATIVES. THE

 26

 WIDER LICENSING OF FOREIGN BANKS WOULD CHANGE THAT  

 OF COURSE. IN ANY EVENT, THE RATE OF CHANGE  

 IN THOSE INDUSTRIES IS NOW RAPID AND IS PROVIDING  

 THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THEM WITH SUBSTANTIAL Ã¢ÂÂ '  

 CHALLENGES OF ADJUSTMENT. AS WITH MANUFACTURING, â'if
