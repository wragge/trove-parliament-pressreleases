 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE 

 DATE:   6 March 2007  

 TITLE:  Joint Press Conference with Dr Wirajuda - Sub Regional Meeting on Counter-  Terrorism, asylum seekers, East Timor 

 

 DR WIRAJUDA:  (spoke in Indonesian)    

 MR DOWNER:  Well thanks very much Minister, and I must say we’ve very much enjoyed  co-hosting this Sub-Regional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism and, I don’t want to repeat  everything that Dr Wirajuda has said, although maybe some people would like me to, because  I’m not sure how the Australian journalists go with their Bahasa Indonesia but I suspect it  might be a fair bit better than mine.  I’ve been aided and abetted by an interpreter.  But, look,  overall, I think this has been a really successful exercise, reflecting the strength of cooperation  that there is in the sub-region, and that there needs to be.  I mean, let’s make it perfectly clear  that the cooperation is essential if we’re going to be successful in countering terrorism.  There  was a clear view amongst the participants there that real success has been made in countering  terrorism in South-East Asia.  Real progress has been made.  And I’ve singled out before, and  I’ll single out again, Indonesia and the Philippines for the work that they have done in  Indonesia over some period of time and the Philippines more recently.  But it’s been very  successful work at different levels.  The discussions focused if you like on two levels.  First of  all, there is, you might call it, a broader political discussion about how to counter radicalism  and extremism.  What is the best method of doing that?  What sort of counter-narrative do you  develop in response to radicalism and extremism, and what do you do to continue the battle  for hearts and minds?  And there were some very useful contributions made and out of that  there was definitely a view that interfaith dialogues are a very important way forward and  Australia and Indonesia established an interfaith dialogue three years ago, which first met in  Yogyakarta and last year in Cebu in the Philippines, and is going to meet in Waitangi in New  Zealand in May and this will be attended by us and also the Philippines President is going,  and obviously the New Zealand Prime Minister and others.  So, this I think it’s agreed, it’s  been a very important process.  It was felt that it would be a good idea to put together a  seminar, a second-track seminar - a seminar of media commentators, academics, to discuss  this whole issue of the counter-narrative and how to address radicalism and extremism.  The  fact that you’ve got here in this sub-region countries which are predominantly Muslim,  countries which are predominantly Christian, a country which is predominantly Buddhist, it  sort of illustrates a very important point.  And that is that despite the different religious  complexions of our countries, we actually have one view about how to address this problem,  and we work together as a team to address it, and in the context of developing the appropriate

  counter-radicalisation strategy, if you like.  The fact that all of us can work together in  developing it and we can learn from each other and the sensitivities of different sections of  our society, I think that’s invaluable.  So I think some seminar sometime later this year of  people like academics, the media, commentators, and so on, will be a very useful contribution  to developing this task.  The other aspect of the conference has been to focus on practical  cooperation in areas such as, interestingly enough, how do you deal with the internet being  used by terrorists.  The internet is used for radical messages, extremist messages, but it’s also  used for the implementation of terrorist acts.  So how do we deal with that?  The question of  emergency responses; manpads, that is portable defence systems, which can be used to fire at  aircraft; how to counter possible chemical and bio-chemical proliferation; (inaudible) that  terrorists have expressed on so many occasions a view that they would like to have access  particularly to biological and chemical weapons and there is some evidence they have tried to  obtain them.  So all of these practical measures require very good cooperation.  And I think  out of this meeting that cooperation that was, as Dr Wirajuda has said, established very much  out of the Bali process in 2004, that cooperation will be consolidated all the more.  I want to  thank Indonesia, Dr Wirajuda in particular, but the Indonesian Government for their  hospitality and for the good work they did in ensuring all the arrangements worked  successfully.   

 MODERATOR:  Thank you, Mr Downer.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Question in Indonesian)   

 DR WIRAJUDA:  (Answer in Indonesian)   

 JOURNALIST:  If I could just clarify one additional issue, the Australian Government has  been claiming it’s waiting for you, for Indonesia, if it will allow 83 Sri Lankan asylum-seekers to be processed by the UNHCR here in Indonesia (inaudible).  What (inaudible) have  you given Mr Downer, and if I could ask Mr Downer as well, what is his response?   

 DR WIRAJUDA:  About those 83 Sri Lankans who landed in Christmas Island are not a  terrorist group, I don’t think so.   

 MR DOWNER:  No evidence.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible) in Sri Lanka has claimed that they’ve been funded and  organised by terrorists (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER:  So that’s how you get the question in to a press conference on counter-terrorism.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible)   

 MR DOWNER:  Fair enough.  It’s ingenious.   

 JOURNALIST:  I thought about using the excuse, but there has been a claim of terrorism.  I  don’t know if you’ve heard that and if you have a response to that as well.

 DR WIRAJUDA:  These people are now in the hands of the Australian authorities  (inaudible) have to ask my colleague Mr Downer how the Australians (inaudible) and in what  way Indonesia could help (inaudible) working together (inaudible).   

 MR DOWNER:  Well I’m not sure about the allegations of their being terrorists.  I hadn’t  caught up with that.  But in any case they are being assessed at the moment by Australian  authorities.  But we’ve had some discussions about this issue with the Indonesians and we’re  continuing those discussions.  They’re not complete.  And we’ve had discussions with Nauru.   So there’s always the possibility that they’ll be sent to Nauru.  One option is that they could  be returned to Indonesia as well, but in the case of Indonesia we’re still talking about that and  whether that would be practical or not, and either way, the Australian Government’s view is  that if we allow them to stay in Australia for assessment of whether they are genuine refugees  or whether they’re not.  What we’ll do is we’ll encourage the people-smuggling rackets that  we’ve had to deal with over the years to start building their numbers again, and that will  create a very big problem.  We’re, I think it’s fair to say, generous in terms of resettling  refugees, but we are very against people-smuggling rackets, people making money out of  people-smuggling, for two reasons.  First of all I think there’s a real issue of morality  involved with making money in that way, kind of a human trafficking operation.  But  secondly, these people-smugglers put these people at very great risk.  They put them on small  boats and undertake hazardous journeys.  I mean, much has been written about the loss of  what is known in Australia as the SIEV-X, and between three and four hundred people were  drowned.  I mean, it’s a classic case of people-smugglers piling people into boats for the  reason of making money.  And they put them into little, dangerous boats and embark on long  journeys, on the open sea.  It’s really a very dangerous thing to do.  So we want to try and  stop people-smuggling, and we’ve had excellent cooperation with Indonesia over the years.   We’ve reduced the numbers very substantially.  In 1999 to 2001, I think I’m right in saying,  from memory, about 12,000 people were smuggled into Australia.  Last year there were 50 or  60 people.  We’ve got one boatload here of 85 or so, which we’re dealing with, but we really  need to keep up the campaign of making sure that these people-smuggling rackets don’t open  up again.  It’s very important we do that, so that’s what we, and the Indonesians and of course  Nauru, we’re talking about.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible.) What are your expectations? (Inaudible.)   

 MR DOWNER:  Well we have very tough laws against terrorism in Australia.  Since 9/11,  since 11 September 2001, we’ve very substantially strengthened our anti-terrorism legislation  in Australia, so it’s a criminal offence now to belong to proscribed terrorist organisations.  It’s  obviously a criminal offence to threaten people or, it goes almost without saying, to use  weapons against people.  So I think by strengthening our laws domestically, that has been a  help for Australia.  But I often make the point, we need to make sure that we address the issue  of radicalisation and extremism, and that people who may be tempted to go down the path of  extremism, they understand the consequence.  Not just the physical consequences, but  understand the sort of society these ideologues are trying to create.  I mean, they want to  create a Taliban-style existence where there are no cell phones allowed, no televisions, no  television stations, no radios, no modernity.  Girls are not allowed to go to school.  At all.  I  mean, this is anathema to most people in Indonesia.  Of course it is.  And it’s important to  understand what these people do want to try to achieve and what this ideology is ultimately 

 about.  I mean, you know, they campaign on the basis of religion, but the reality is what they  want to destroy is modern society, modern human existence, and sort of cast at least some  parts of the world back into the Middle Ages and even before (inaudible - end of tape) to try

 to spell out some alternative and more attractive proposition.  So it’s not just a question of  having tough laws and effective police and customs and so on, it’s also a question of making  sure that we win the hearts and minds battle, all of us, and I think as a matter of fact the  Indonesian Government has been doing a good job in that respect, in all of those respects.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Question in Indonesian)   

 DR WIRAJUDA:  (Answer in Indonesian)   

 MR DOWNER:  We’re very biased towards our national broadcaster here.  So we complain  about them on the one hand but we give them a free run on the other.   

 JOURNALIST:  I note with interest that you have discussed how to prevent Jihadist  recruitment et cetera (inaudible) I’m wondering if Mr Downer raised with his Indonesian  counterpart whether it might be a good idea first to not enable convicted terrorists to have  access to laptops and mobile phones while in prison.   

 MR DOWNER:  Well I can give you an answer on the basis of the meeting I had this  morning with the Law and Justice Minister, who when I discussed this broad issue of the  detention of terrorists in Indonesia, explained to me that next month Indonesia will be  opening a new prison, which is a very high security prison, and this will house terrorists,  convicted terrorists, and they will not have access to those sorts of tools of modernity, and it  will be beyond the range, for example, of mobile phones and the internet and so on.  So he  made it perfectly clear that as the Minister responsible, he was concerned about the way  terrorists had been gaining, as you rightly asked, gaining access to, well, the media and other  organisations, and the Indonesian Government quite rightly wants to deal with that.  I must  say I was very heartened and very impressed.  I can’t speak for what the prison will be like  but it’s being built now and it’s on an island off the coast of Java and, (inaudible) able to say  where it is, but it sounds like a tough regime for people convicted of terrorism.  But then  terrorism is an egregious offence.   

 DR WIRAJUDA:  Yes, (inaudible) prisoners are not allowed to have access to means of  communication such as the internet and cell phones.  (Inaudible) of these prisoners had access  to some of the phones and internets but (inaudible) on a regular basis (inaudible) authorities  are conducting raids to prisons (inaudible) those means of communications, cell phones and  internet are confiscated.   

 JOURNALIST:  Dr Wirajuda, just to clarify, there is already a prison on (inaudible).  Mr  Downer talked about a new facility.  The Bali bombers are in (inaudible) now.   

 DR WIRAJUDA:  (Inaudible) one Mr Downer just mentioned is the contractions of new  prisons, high security prisons, that is planned for terrorists.  I mean, who are convicted, for  that matter, to prevent them to have access to communications.   

 MR DOWNER:  And I understand the prison will have capacity for about 400 to 500  prisoners.   

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Downer, could you please (inaudible) the situation in East Timor.   (Inaudible) terrorist groups.

 MR DOWNER:  He means this in the nicest possible way.  Well, we’re obviously concerned  about the instability about East Timor and we have been particularly concerned about it since  April last year, and we have about between eight and nine hundred troops on the ground in  East Timor.  There are some New Zealand troops and Portuguese gendarmerie, and there is a  significant United Nations police presence there as well.  Just in recent times there is a  fugitive, Major Reinado, who escaped from prison in East Timor in August of last year.  He  has been on the loose.  There have been attempts by the East Timorese Government to  negotiate with him and to persuade him to hand himself in.  He’s refused to do so, though he  has entered into negotiations on a number of occasions with the East Timorese.  When he and  some of his people raided police stations and stole automatic weapons from police stations,  the East Timorese Government asked the international security force to capture him.  And so  an endeavour is being made to do that.  And that is still an operation which is underway.  In  this environment, there are some disruptions, protests, from strident political opponents of the  East Timor Government and obviously people are entitled to protest, as long as they do so  peacefully and according to the laws of East Timor.  So we’ve had some concerns about the  stability at the moment in East Timor, some concerns about the situation.  And we have  recommended to Australians there that they leave.  There are commercial flights available, in  and out of East Timor, but we recommend Australians don’t visit East Timor for the time  being, and that those who are there leave because we think that Australians could be targeted  by protestors and sympathisers of Major Reinado and we don’t want them to get into harm’s  way.  So we are concerned about the situation and we are doing our best to calm it down and  obviously the military are working on capturing on Major Reinado.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Question in Indonesian)   

 DR WIRAJUDA:  (Answer in Indonesian)   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible)   

 MR DOWNER:  Well, not exactly in those terms.  But let me just say in relation to those  issues, terrorists will inevitably endeavour to change their tactics and their strategies in the  face of counter-terrorism measures.  That’s normal.  And therefore it’s very important to  continue to be flexible in developing counter-terrorism methods, and to learn from what’s  happening in different parts of the world.  I mean, you point to what’s happened in parts of  the Middle East and terrorism there has gone through a series of iterations, as counter-terrorism measures have been put in place, and then the terrorists have had to try to find ways  around those.  But in this part of the world we’re obviously alive to what has been happening  in other parts of the world and we understand that terrorists in time gradually learn what  techniques we use to counter them, and they try then to in turn counter those measures, and  we ensure that we’re on top of what their new measures are, and their new techniques.  And  certainly just banning organisations, or passing a whole lot of laws is not going to be a  sufficient solution to the problem.  You have to do everything, from run successful hearts-and-minds campaigns, through to very good intelligence collection, through to good day-to-day policing and observation, through to public education programs, through to assisting  through religious institutions, religious organisations and educational institutions and  organisations with counter-terrorism messages.  So there are all sorts of different things you  have to do, and you’ve got to get the balance right, and it’s not easy.  But in this part of the  world there has been more success than in some other parts of the world.
