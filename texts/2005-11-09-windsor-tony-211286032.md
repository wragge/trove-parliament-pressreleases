  UNE research gets Federal funding  Independent Member for New England, Tony Windsor has welcomed the funding announcement by the  Minister for Education Science and Technology, the Hon Dr Brendan Nelson for a number of research  projects to be conducted at the University of New England. 

  “Research is a vital component of a University’s activities and it is also a vital part of helping to expand  and progress our knowledge. 

  The University of New England has excellent research capacity and the projects to be funded will  contribute much to better understanding our past, present and future opportunities and needs. 

  I congratulate all those associated with the research projects and wish them every success in achieving  their goals and expanding our knowledge in these fields. 

  I also thank Minister Nelson and the Federal Government for including funding for the 6 projects through  the Australian Research Council process,” Mr Windsor said. 

  The following are the projects to receive funding support from the Federal Government and those W E   Staff associated with each project and the funding for each project.

  Longitudinal twin study of literacy, language and attention 

  The primary practical national benefit will be in the unrivalled picture that emerges about how genetic  factors interact with aspects of the familial and educational environment to determine the course of  children’s development in literacy and language.  . . . .2/

  Policy makers in preschool and school education will be able to use the information to guide curriculum  refinement and to develop policies for the early identification of children at developmental risk in these  domains. As an international project, the research will also promote scientific cooperation between  Australia, the USA, and Scandinavia in a cutting-edge branch of human psychology, the interaction of 

  genes and environment in psychological development.

  Primary RFCD 3705 DEMOGRAPHY  Administering Institution The University of New England  Project Summary  This project, which aims to inform public discussion and policy development on two important areas,  population and migration and security and governance, in Southeast Asia, will contribute to the process  of safeguarding Australia through improved understanding of our neighbours' state policies. The scholarly  outcomes will also support teaching in refugee and migration studies. An enhanced understanding of, and  cooperation on population regulation and the movement of people across and within borders in the region  is central to the maintenance of effective bilateral and multilateral relations between Australia and its  neighbours.

  Administering Institution The University of New England  Project Summary 

  How Do Stone Tools Reflect Cognition Among the First Australians and their 

  The popularity of the Indonesian 'hobbit' (Homo floresiensis) discovery provides an ideal platform for  interpreting Australasian prehistory to a wider community. This project explores the arrival of modem  humans in Indonesia, their interaction with 'hobbits', and the colonisation of Australia by comparing the  different ways these horninins made stone tools. Although research indicates a significant level of  behavioural unity in our genus, 'hobbits' were not like us. 'Us' refers, of course, to modem humans, and  hence this research is of global relevance. By applying a 'design space' model to toolmaking in the past, 

  this project will demonstrate that the earliest trends in technology apply equally to human groups  throughout the world.

  Synchrotrons, wavelet analysis and novel imaging techniques - applying physics 

  Project Title  2006 : $80,000 

  2007 : $60,000 

  2008 : $50,000 

  Primary RFCD 2499 OTHER PHYSICAL SCIENCES 

  Administering Institution The University of New England  Project Summary  Breast cancer leads to the second highest number of person-years of life lost due to cancer in Australia,  with little known about its transport around the body. Current screening methods for breast cancer are  neither 100% sensitive or specific and are heavily dependent upon expert training. This project will  contribute by yielding valuable information on the transport of breast cancer and contribute to the  development of an automated diagnostic method, with the possibility of its application to other diseases.  The project will also involve members of the regional community, train regional scientists and provide  synchrotron experience for Australian scientists in time for Australia's first synchrotron.

  Enabling place pedagogies in rural and urban Australia 

  This project will tell us how children and adults learn about place in the local areas where they live and  work. The findings will be applied in action research with teachers in early childhood, school, and adult  education settings, and in the preparation of teachers. It will address two Research Priority areas, 1: An  Environmentally Sustainable Australia and 2. Strengthening Australiafs economic and social fabric,  which we argue are inseparable. Incorporating the findings into the curricula of teacher education will 

  ensure that the project will have sustained long term benefits as well as the immediate application built  into the study.

  It will have immediate national benefit in the production of educational resources based on alternative and  previously invisible stories of water in the Narran Lakes area, an icon site in the Murray-Darling Basin.  The findings will have longer term national benefit by identifying the elements of a general pedagogy of  place, drawn from the specific local case study of the Narran Lakes, which will be applied in adult and  community education.
