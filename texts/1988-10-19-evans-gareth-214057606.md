 Australian emergency aid for Mozambican refugees in Malawi

 Australia will provide $250,000 for emergency relief to Mozambican  refugees in Malawi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator  Gareth Evans, announced today.

 The grant will be used to purchase and distribute blankets to many of the  approximately 700,000 Mozambicans who have sought refuge in Malawi.

 The number of refugees fleeing the internal unrest in Mozambique continues  to increase and is expected to reach 800,000 by the end of 1988.

 "These people arrive in Malawi with little or no possessions. Blankets  provide warmth, protection from disease and an additional outer layer of  clothing," Senator Evans said.

 Australia's contribution will be channelled through AUSTCARE.

 The grant is in addition to the 5,000 metric tonnes of emergency food aid  (valued at approximately $1.7 million) Australia is providing for the United  Nations High Commisioner for Refugees program of assistance for  Mozambican refugees in Malawi.

 Australia’s assistance to Mozambican refugees is part of the Government's  humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian International  Development Assistance Bureau, Canberra.
