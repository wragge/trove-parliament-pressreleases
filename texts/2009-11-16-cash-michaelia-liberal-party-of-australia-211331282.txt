 Come clean on your dirty deal Mr Rudd   

 16 November 2009 

 Immigration Minister Chris Evans has today been challenged to come clean on the full details of  the Rudd Government’s special deal to bribe the Sri Lankan asylum seekers off the Oceanic  Viking.    

 “Minister Evans should come clean and reveal the complete details of the Rudd Government’s  offer to the asylum seekers aboard the Oceanic Viking, not just those items he is happy to have  printed in the press” said Senator Michaelia Cash today after Question Time in the Senate.   

 “The Rudd Government’s desperate ploy highlights the Prime Minister’s willingness to throw  money at a problem without real regard for the impact it will have” said Senator Cash.   

 “The latest twist in the Oceanic Viking debacle must be rolled gold advertising to the people  smugglers.     

 “The Prime Minister must show leadership on this important issue and not simply outsource his  policy failure to Indonesia.”
