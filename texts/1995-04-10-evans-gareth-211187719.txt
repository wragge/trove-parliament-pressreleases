  Attached is Senator Evans's address to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  (SIPRI), and Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Seminar entitled 1he Use of  Force in Peace Operations. 

  I The Changing Backdrop 

  Perceptions: starting from behind. The UN is notoriously bad at learning from its own 

  experience, in part because it is forever scrambling to respond to the latest crisis. Meetings such 

  as this fill an important gap, not only in identifying what has gone right or wrong with past UN 

  operations, but in suggesting ways in which the lessons might be implemented. There is a great 

  deal of hard-won practical experience assembled in this room: experience in negotiating 

  political agreements underpinning UN operations, in negotiating resolutions setting their 

  mandates, in decision-making about the use of force as military commanders in UN operations, 

  and generally in analysing the problems and thinking about how they could be better addressed. 

  We have a degree of common interest in developing the UN's capacity, and in a way that builds  on past experience rather than tries to start from scratch. I certainly hope that we can draw from  our combined experience some specific conclusions about the use of force in peace operations,  in ways that can better inform UN actions in the future. 

  Perceptions of failure by the United Nations in the conduct of its recent peace operations have 

  become unhappily pervasive in the world's media. Images of Blue Helmets unable to prevent 

  fighting, or confined to the role of onlookers in the face of horrific abuses of human rights, are a 

  familiar staple. I think of that AP photograph late last year of a 7-year old boy, the victim of a 

  sniper, lying dead on the street in Sarajevo: beside him stand two distraught UN peace keepers, 

  disbelief, helplessness and shock on their faces. Then there were those pictures in February of 

  the remaining UN forces in Somalia being evacuated from the beach - and firing back at the 

  Somali people they had come to help just 20 months before. 

  These kinds of images from Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda, combined with the apparently 

  general lack of understanding among media commentators that, as General Sanderson has 

  commented, "peace keeping is not war", have all inevitably corroded public attitudes to the UN. 

  The criticisms are, of course, often quite unfair. They ignore the humanitarian benefits that  have been achieved - the hundreds of thousands of lives saved in Somalia alone; they ignore 

  the UN's very real successes in recent peace keeping exercises in Mozambique, Namibia,

  Cambodia and El Salvador; they overlook the vital work of UN agencies in the so-called 'silent  emergencies' of poverty and deprivation and they ignore the immense conceptu-al and practical 

  difficulties involved in any UN intervention, especially in internal crises, where the need to use  force cannot be ruled ouL But, unfairly or not, the image of an organisation â‘ unable to meet its  primary goals is giving fresh ammunition to the UN's critics in the West (especially in the US  Congress), and in the developing world as well. The need for the UN to find answers to these 

  problems is crucial if it is to maintain the wide political support essential to its operations. 

  Traditional understandings about the use of force.â‘ The Organisation's founders certainly  contemplated the use of force as a legitimate response to particular kinds of security problems;  indeed the enforcement provisions of Chapter VII were in many respects at the heart of the  reason for the UN's foundation. After the failure of the League of Nations to control the  militarism and expansionism that led to World War II, governments, in particuiar those of  smaller and more vulnerable countries, wanted an organisation which could credibly act as a 

  guarantor of international security - including in resisting through collective action blatant acts  of aggression. But it is also clear in both the letter and spirit of the Charter that military force is  a last resort measure, to be used only after the exhaustion of efforts to settle disputes and to  bring an end to conflicts by peaceful means. 

  For most of the UN's first forty-five years, the period of the Cold War, these elements of the  UN Charter lay dormant and (Korea apart), the Congo in 1960 provided the UN's only direct  involvement in enforcement through military action. This operation's original Chapter VI  mandate (SCR143), to assist the newly independent government in maintaining law and order  and to provide technical assistance, was expanded when the Security Council authorised 

  enforcement action to prevent civil war (SCR161) and to complete the removal of mercenaries  (SCR169) following the secession of Katanga province. ;The UN's experience in the Congo was 

  not a happy one. The operation incurred many cas~alties among UN forces. It was  controversial and lacked solid support from permanent members of the Security Council. It saw  a reaction against forceful UN operations, and against putting Blue Helmets into situations of  active conflict. 

  The only other enforcement action in this period was, of course, the operation in Korea in 1950, 

  which the UN authorised, but did not command. The Security Council, which was able to act 

  during a temporary withdrawal by the Soviet Union, recommended that member stat~s provide  assistance to the ROK to repel the armed attack (SCR83), created a Unified Command to which  member states contributed troops, asked the United States to designate the commander and  authorised the Unified Command to use the UN flag (SCR84) .

  There is no express provision in the UN Charter for the deployment of military personnel with a 

  mandate inhibiting the use of force. Yet peace keeping, which involves ' just' that, is fairly 

  claimed as an invention of the UN, one which has won it deserved credit- including, in 1988 â‘ 

  the Nobel Peace prize. The beginnings of the notion of peace keeping go back to 1948 and the 

  establishment of the UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO). â‘ A key element' in these 

  operations has been, from their start, the principle of non-use of force. .In the case of UNTSO, 

  Ralphe Bunche, then deputy to the Mediator for Palestine, insisted that military observers 

  should not carry any arms at all. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold further refined the 

  appli~ble principles, however, with the establishment of UNEF I to contain the Suez crisis in 

  1956, stating that: 

  ... men engaged in the operation may never take the initiative in the use of armed 

  force, but are entitled to respond with force to an attack with arms, including 

  attempts to use force to make them withdraw from positions which they occupy 

  under orders from the Commander, acting under the authority of the Assembly and 

  within the scope of its resolutions. 

  There are several reasons why non-use of force is an integral part of the concept of peace 

  keeping as it emerged in the first fifty years of the UN. First there are reasons of Charter 

  authority and principle. The authority for peace keeping is seen as squarely derived. from 

  Chapter VI, The Pacific Settlement Disputes', more specifically as an 'other peaceful means' 

  within Article 33: this Chapter gives commanders in the field no clear authority to take an)1hing 

  other than peaceful measures. Peace keeping evolved essentially as an experiment in defining a 

  useful role for the UN as a third party facilitating the peaceful settlements of certain conflicts -those exercises which the US and the Soviet Union could support, or in some cases tolerate, in a 

  period in:which bipolar tensions ruled out more active approaches by the Security Coun.cil. 

  At a more practical level, as it became clear that Charter provisions for a command and control  structure through the Military Staff Committee were a dead letter, there was no readily available  mechanism for the organisation of enforcement operations, which would have required higher 

  levels of interoperability and greater demands on equipment and force numbers than typical 

  peace keeping operations, which latter simply acted as a buffer between forces or in a 

  monitoring capacity. Moreover, it was of the nature of UN peace keeping operations (PKOs) 

  that they were essentially a political tool, and peace keepers had to function in a way consistent 

  with the political objective of their mission. The use of force by UN forces would have 

  complicated the peace making diplomacy which was the rationale for their existence. But the 

  most compelling practical reason for non-use of force in peace keeping was that PKOs were, by 

  their very nature, premised on the consent by the warring parties to the UN's presence and on 

  .. .. . 

  4 

  the essential need to preserve impartiality and neutrality. Any use of force by peace keepers  needed to be weighed against the need to retain the confidence of the parties. 

  A further deterrent to the use of force was the usual expectation of troop contributing countries  that they were committing their forces to situations of low-level risk only. â‘ â‘ This was not 

  unreasonable, given that the UN's operations were not supported by an elaborate, sophisticated  international command and that the diverse forces provided by member states were often at 

  quite different levels of preparedness and efficiency. Moreover, while troops may have been  willfng to lay down their lives for their countries, peace keeping missions were not usually  directly related to a threat to the national defence of thoSe countries making'up the contingents.  In these circumstances many governments were often understandably unwilling - as they still  are - to expose their contingents to highly dangerous situations and to the domestic reactions  which casualties would bring. 

  The principle of non-use of force was not, of course, an absolute prohibition. At least from  1956, it was acknowledged that rules of engagement (ROEs) should permit the use of force in  self-defence. This was, however, defined tightly. In the case of UNTAC, for example, the 

  ROEs first stated in general terms that "the use of force is authorised either in self-defence or in  resisting attempts by forceful means to prevent UNTAC from accomplishing its mission". The  ROEs then specified that UNTAC personnel were authorised to use "unarmed force", being the  use of all means, short of weapons, in a range of situations including threat to the safety of UN  personnel, infiltrations attempted without firing, violations of UN premises and in self-defence  against unarmed attack. They were authorised to use armed force against armed persons in self  defence; against attempts to disarm UNT AC personnel; if other UN personnel were in mortal 

  danger, in defence of UNTAC posts; to defend positions or vehicles under armed attack; against  attempts made to compel UNTAC personnel by force to withdraw from a position they were  ordered to occupy by their commanders; against attempts to penetrate a UN post or cut off a UN  force with the use of armed force; and if attempts were made to abduct or arrest UN civilians or  military personnel using force. The ROES also stated that in all forceful actions by UNTAC  personnel, the principle of minimum force and proportionate response applied, and set out the  sequence to be followed in all situations other than in the case of immediate threat to life or if 

  casualties had already been sustained. 

  The new environment of the 1990s. While political constraints on decision-making by the  Security Council have lessened significantly with the passing of the Cold War and the virtual  disappearance of the veto, the experience of more UN operations, and of more ambitious UN 

  operations, has exposed important constraints on the UN's effectiveness. In the last few years,  we have tested the limits of how far the UN's secretariat resources can stretch, and of how much 

  5 

  member states are willing to contribute, in troops and finance. We have discovered that, even  with generous arrangements for seconding military staff into UN headquarters (the Australian 

  Defence Force, for example, has seven staff seconded into the Department of Peace Keeping),  there are serious limits to the capacity of the UN Secretariat to act as a strategic headquarters  handling, as at the present time, 17 operations around the world. Our Ministers for Defence 

  have come to focus with greater preoccupation on the limited headquarters capacity for  planning and administration. 

  We have learnt that, at least for the moment, there seems to be a ceiling of around 70-80,000 

  troops which member states will collectively make available to the Secretary-General at any  one time, and that there is often a considerable lag before these forces can be deployed to the  field. The budget for peace operations has risen ten-fold in three years, and we are now seeing  that the largest contributor has decided unilaterally to cut its share of that budget, and that many  developing countries fear that the expansion in payments for such operations will be at the  expense of funding for their priority concern of economic and social development. 

  We have also observed the limitations on Security Council mandates for many operations. The  last few years have given us all too many examples of politically-influenced mandates which  have not been achievable in the field or which have lacked the clarity about goals and time  frames which commanders could reasonably expect. Similarly, we have seen missions  undertaken without providing the necessary resources, and the UN assuming a role in complex  situations without sufficient thought given to how Blue Helmeted forces should interact with 

  other international actors, whether these be non-governmental aid bodies or major UN organs  or agencies such as the UNHCR. On a more heartening note, we have also seen that the  Security Council can improve the quality of its output, with an increasing effort being made to  be more specific in framing mandates about such crucial elements as the time fiame for 

  missions. 

  A good deal has been written, including by some at this table, about "second generation" peace  keeping and so-called "Chapter VI 'n" operations. Certainly we have seen a change in the  character of many peace keeping operations since the late 1980s. This has had much to do with  the changing nature of the conflicts the UN has faced. Traditional inter-state war, with its  relative simplicities and certitudes, is now conspicuously rare, and the new problems are  overwhelmingly to do with intra-state conflict. According to SIPRrs 1994 Yearbook, every 

  one of the 34 major armed conflicts waged in 1993 were intra-state conflicts. There is an  evident "zone of conflict" including the former communist states, much of Africa, and parts of  Central and Latin America and South Asia, where too many states seem caught by a downward  spiral of economic decline, often exacerbated by official corruption and mismanagement, 

  6 

  creating governments which are at or near collapse and which are being challenged, often 

  violently, by their own citizens. Economic decline has hastened the process of national  disintegration, and vice versa. 

  Intra-state conflict poses a whole range of new complications, involving more often than notâ‘  the emergence of non-State actors as relevant players, multi-sided disputes, and the consequent  difficulty of maintaining an image of impartiality, and it bas required new responses from peace  keepers. "Traditional" PKOs involved not much more than unarmed or lightly armed military  contingents being engaged in the monitoring, supervision and verification of ceasefire, buffer 

  zone, withdrawal and related . aieements, usually htvolving clearly defined borders or  demarcation lines. The more recent generation of "expanded" peace keeping operations  involves in addition a wide range of activities such as cantonment and demobilisation of troops;  election monitoring or organisation; assistance with the repatriation of refugees; human rights  protection; monitoring police activities and training new police forces; and exercising civil 

  administration functions during transition to independence or democracy. Operations in  Rwanda, Cambodia, Angola and Mozambique, for example, have been more activist and multi " functional in character than nearly all those that the UN had previously undertaken.  "Expanded" peace keeping bas recognised the reality that "traditional" peace keeping was often  not enough to achieve a lasting peaceful settlement - it was both a response to the challenge for  the UN to do more and in itself a new challenge for the UN to plan and manage these more  ambitious operations. 

  Inevitably, the expansion of UN peace keeping operations bas increased the frequency and  intensity with which personnel are exposed to danger. Leaving aside the Korean and Gulf  Wars, which were not strictly Blue Helmets operations, some 754 Blue Helmets diep in the 

  forty years of UN peace keeping, up to and including 1988, nearly a third of them (234) in just  one operation - the Congo. But 528 have been lost since - and of these deaths, almost half  (293) have been in the two recent operations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. We have 

  been confronted starkly as a result with a series of conceptual and practical questions about the  legitimacy and desirability of using force in peace keeping operations. 

  While most of the new "expanded" peace keeping functionsâ‘ can be accommodated easily 

  enough within a Chapter VI framework, problems do arise when one seeks to add an  enforcement role of some kind to a traditional peace keeping operation, particularly in the  context of protecting humanitarian relief operations, protecting peace keeper's under threat,  preventing or reacting to major human rights violations, or, more generally, acting to "defend 

  the mission". It is to these problems that I now tum.

  II Using Force by Mandate 

  Recent recourse to Chapter Vll authority. The two Chapter VII enforcement operations in â‘ 

  the 45 years to 1990 were followed in quick succession by six more since, in response to Iraq's 

  invasion of Kuwait; the breakdown of law and order in Somalia; the support of humanitarian 

  aid, freedom of movement of UN personnel and protection of safe areas in former Yugoslavia; 

  systematic and widespread killings in Rwanda; and the restoration of democratically-elected 

  government in Haiti. In the case of the operations mounted under French command in Rwanda 

  last year and under United States command in Haiti, the enforcement mandates were limited in 

  time, and gave way relatively soon to Chapter VI UN operations. The Unified Task Force in 

  Somalia (UNITAF), which was authorised under Chapter VII, was succeeded in mid-1993 by 

  an expanded UNOSOM with a mandate which mixed elements of Chapter VI and Chapter VII. 

  The mandate of UNPROFOR in Bosnia began as a Chapter VI mandate but developed various 

  Chapter VII strands. On 31 March 1995, a distinct Chapter VII operation under UN command 

  was created for Croatia - the UN Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), 

  which is authorised to take "all necessary measures to extend close air support to the territory of 

  the Republic of Croatia in defence of UNCRO personnel in the performance of UNCRO's 

  mandate ... ". These operations were varied in nature and their outcomes, and they offer different 

  lessons for us. 

  This increasing recourse to Chapter VII action has not gone unquestioned. Somalia, in 

  particular, has frequently been cited as a model of an operation gone wrong - not just because it 

  largely failed to achieve its mandate, but because it introduced a new element into peace 

  enforcement in support of peace keeping, one in which the UN came to be seen as a partisan 

  protagonist in the fighting. The reaction by UNOSOM II forces to the killing of 24 Pakistani 

  troops in June 1993 (the largest UN loss since the Congo) was seen by many as excessively 

  violent, a futile effort to fight fire with fire which brought with it many unforeseen 

  consequences and which stood in contrast to the restraint which operations in the Congo and 

  Lebanon had shown in the face of similar provocation. Attacks by helicopter gunships on 

  civilians, documented abuse of detainees, racist attitudes by some UN troops, and the descent to 

  what I fear can only be described as tragic farce in the pursuit of General Aideed - all these 

  helped make Somalia a watershed in ideas about what sort of force, and how much, should be 

  used in UN operations. 

  Somalia raised as well questions about approaches to the arming of UN forces. There is 

  evidence to suggest that the availability to UNOSOM of heavy weapons helped shape its 

  responses, complicating the usual gradualist approaches which demand that proportionality be a 

  condition of each heightened step of response. The possession of heavy firepower predisposed 

  â‘.

  decisions to use it, before less violent options were fully explored. 

  When UN operations are initiated under Chapter VI, but are subsequently given a Chapter VII  dimension, the result bas been, as in Bosnia and Somalia, an acceptance of the UN's presence  that is ambivalent at best. Traditional understanding about the appropriate use of force has  come under much strain, at times causing frustration for commanders who become unsure about  how to guarantee the safety of their troops. Such situations are often newsworthy because of the  ready images which contrast aspects of the. UN's role, in particular as between its humanitarian 

  or human rights obligations and its prudent practices of maintaining neutrality. This tension is  sometimes exploited by the parties to their own ends. There are two particularly important  reasons for seeking greater clarity about the UN's legitimate role and its legitimate reaction to  threat: on the one band to give commanders clearer guidance, and put pressure on political  decision makers, in the Council and within Governments, to establish clear and achievable  goals for UN operations; and on the other to counteract the often ill-informed attacks on the  UN and its credibility by promoting a better understanding of what the UN can and cannot do. 

  Protecting humanitarian relief operations. Notwithstanding the difficulties invariably  involved, there are situations in which an enforcement mandate will be required if the UN is to  be involved at all. The most complex area is probably the protection of humanitarian relief.  While the circumstances of each case have required markedly different responses from the UN,  it is helpful here to draw a distinction between operations which are established chiefly for-the  purpose of humanitarian relief (with the attendant debate about legitimate grounds for  "humanitarian intervention") and operations which are established for some other purpose, onto 

  which is subsequently added a humanitarian relief function as, for example, the case of 

  UNPROFOR. 

  Humanitarian intervention is essentially a Chapter VII action because it presupposes a lack of  consent by some or all parties to the UN's presence. It is evident that, despite much debate  following SCR 688 and Operation Provide Comfort in Northern Iraq, no international consensus  has yet emerged about its legitimacy, and it is still by no means a commonplace or widely  accepted response. The experience of Somalia, again, has prompted reconsideration about the  basis for humanitarian intervention operations. Somalia showed how the ability of the United 

  Nations and NGOs to deliver humanitarian assistance can be severely damaged once UN forces  have in effect become a party to the dispute. It demonstrated the extent of the resources needed  (and the time to deploy them) in order to provide guarantees of safety for aid-deliverers in a  conflict situation, and the unwillingness of governments to expose their troops to this level of 

  risk. It raised, also, questions of selectivity - why was it that UN forces were used in this way  in Somalia but not in comparable countries with comparable levels of human suffering, such as 

  -t.-"tr  " 

  9 

  Rwanda, Liberia, or the Sudan? 

  Protection of humanitarian relief as part of a broader operation is a typical feature of mixed  mandate or "mission cr~p" situations. If there is only a Chapter VI mandate in existence, or if  there is a formal Chapter VII mandate but insufficient resources to effectively implement it, the  force commander's job becomes almost impossible. The experience in Bosnia of actions such  as convoy protection and the protection of airlifts into Sarajevo highlights the need to find ways  of preserving both the substance and the appearance of neutrality, so that the legitimacy of the  operation is not called into question and other key objectives of the peace keeping mission are  not jeopardised. 

  The protection must be carried out in ways which are acceptable to the warring parties, such as 

  patient negotiation over roadblocks. This may mean enduring persistent harassment and  obstruction. It must also be carried out in a way that does not erode the capacity of the  deliverers of humanitarian assistance to continue doing their job, and ensures that aid will reach  the needy. The unhappy reality on the ground, however, is often that the parties will blackmail  humanitarian agencies into delivering assistance to their own people or forces, who are not  necessarily the intended recipients. There are no easy answers to these dilemmas. 

  Protecting peace keepers under threat. Bosnia provides a number of examples of mandates 

  under Chapter VII intended to protect peace keepers from the threat of armed attack. One of the  lessons of Bosnia is the need for prompt action by the Security Council to authorise protective  action: responsibility should not be placed on field commanders to interpret inadequate  mandates so as to allow in fact for the use of force when this was not the original intention.  Once a mandate authorising use of force has been established, with a clear indication of when  force may be used, the decision must be left to the commander on the ground so that tliere can 

  be effective response in urgent situations. Rules of Engagement guidelines can readily be  written- as they were in UNTAC- to protect peace keepers under general threat. But ROEs  are a basis for intelligent judgment, not a substitute for it: it is important that decisions in the  field do not threaten the basic purposes of the mission, for example by disrupting political  negotiations through precipitate or excessive reactions to threats. 

  Even when there is political authority for commanders to use force, their latitude to do so in  practice can still be narrow. Sometimes they are effectively limited in their ability to respond to  threats to safety because they cannot risk escalation beyond the capacity of their forces to deal  with. Decisions to provide reinforcements will often be political rather than tactical. And the 

  level of resources made available by the Security Council is frequently more a function of 

  political or financial considerations than military planning. It is instructive to recall that in 

  10 

  Bosnia, when the Council was determining the additional force necessary to protect safe have~s,  a total force of 30,000 was recommended by the force commander. This was reduced to 15,000 

  on the Secretariat's advice to the Security Council, after much pressure from the P3 to keep costs  down. The Security Council's final approval was for a force of 7 ,500. 

  The greatest protection for peace keepers is to retain consent and the willing cooperation of the  parties . Complex, multi-sided operations characterised by ethnic or religious conflict and the  breakdown of the state are all likely to make PKOs more vulnerable. In some cases, the most  effective form of protection for peace keepers is probably deployment in sufficient numbers to  deter any attacks. But any deterrent step of this kind, to remain plausible, has to be backed by a  credible threat of punitive reaction to deliberate attacks on Blue Helmets. The threat of air 

  strikes against Serb positions was effective for a time after the adoption of SCR 816, but the  failure to use it in any practical way soon diminished that effectiveness. 

  The simple truth here is that there are no easy or risk-free answers to ensuring the safety of UN  peace keepers when they are deployed in an active conflict. The common thread of situations  like Mogadishu and Bihac, where Blue Helmets have become highly vulnerable to attack or are  being deliberately targeted, is that consent to their presence has broken down. When the  authority for that presence is so undermined we should ask ourselves whether Chapter VI peace  keeping is, in any traditional understanding of what that means, still feasible. Of course, the  problems of maintaining an image of impartiality and continued consent are multiplied once  enforcement action has been taken, and this is a consideration which must be weighed carefully  in judgments about enforcement action to protect peace keepers. Lt General Sanderson makes  the point that "unlike the laws of physics, in which every action has an equal and opposite 

  reaction, actions in war are likely to be magnified several-fold as passions are compoun_ded by  the fatal consequences of conflict". 

  A recurrent theme in the use of force in peace operations is that its consequences for the  political goals of the operation must be a key consideration. Options that may be viable if, for  example, simple military victory were the chief consideration, will often be dismissed for this 

  reason. For this reason it is important to develop viable alternatives to the use of force, such as  the negotiated extraction of peace keepers from difficult sitUations. We have observed  . successful examples of this in Bosnia on a number of occasions. Again, at the end of 1992,  there was a spate of hostage taking of UNTAC personnel by the Khmer Rouge: in each case  release of the hostages was secured through negotiation, at the local level, including through the 

  Khmer Rouge liaison officers and diplomatic channels in Phnom Penh. Embargoes, sanctions 

  and blockades might also be considered as alternatives to the use of force. 

  11 

  Protecting human rights. It is coming to be increasingly accepted that, even in the absence of ~ ' . . . . . . . '  any formal Chapter VII mandate, peace keepers who are present when a serious, espe

  threatening, violation of human rights is occurring or about to occur, have a d~ty, if they can 

  realistically do something to stop it, not to stand idly by. We would not expect our national 

  forces to do nothing to help in such cases, and we should expect no less when they are serving 

  under the UN flag. This is not to say that individual peace keepers w_ill not sometimes be 

  caught out by events and be unable to act effectively. But to the extent that they can act to 

  prevent an atrocity, they should. 

  Actions to prevent atrocities should be distinguished from the appropriate reaction after such 

  incidents have occurred. This is often more difficult for commanders in the field â‘and those 

  framing political instructions in New York, as punitive actions will almost. always be seen as 

  taking sides, with consequences for the underlying acceptance of the UN . operation and the 

  parties' faith in the UN's impartiality. In the absence of a Chapter VII mandate,â‘ peace keepers 

  have no general right of arrest, no method of detention, no court of law to which to refer 

  violators. It is important in the context of proposed punitive action that commanders, and those 

  setting their mandate, keep their eyes firmly on the basic purpose of their mission. Lt General 

  Sanderson may well recount to you the difficulties he faced in Cambodia in resisting pressure to 

  go after the Khmer Rouge following some of their more vicious atrocities: being profoundly 

  tempted to do so, but knowing that such action would have derailed UNTACs mission. 

  A further dimension of this problem is the role that Blue Helmets should play to assist war 

  crimes tribunals, as have been established for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. A host of 

  problems arise, ranging from the practical, such as providing security for witnesses, to questions 

  of principle such as the system of law under which accused persons are to be tried. Perceptions  that such tribunals are being imposed from outside may raise questions of sovereignty, even 

  where those questioned have not been a major objection to UN intervention. The involvement 

  of peace keeping operations in such activities immediately raises questions about the impact on  their capacity to do the job for which they were established. 

  This is not to question the importance of such tribunals or, more broadly of strengthening the 

  local system of justice and the rule of law, as critical elements of many peace operations. In 

  operations which are not premised on consent and non-use of force, there may in fact be more 

  scope for multinational forces to become directly involved in law enforcement. For example, 

  the Australian contingent based in Baidoa in Somalia as part of UNITAF was quite effective in 

  reviving local systems of justice . 

  More generally, however, and particularly in Chapter VI operations, solutions lie in creating or 

   " " " :.  " " v ;â‘ "â‘ .. "â‘

  strengthening local judicial processes so that an effective criminal justice system is in place to  deal with human rights offenders, including after UN forces have departed. In many cases, 

  civilian police contingents can assist. I have previously suggested that, for "expanded" peace  keeping missions in states where the breakdown of law and order is one of the features of the 

  conflict, "justice packages" be developed with the aim of ensuring viable local legal systems.  This would involve assistance with some or all of the following: creating a body of criminal law  and prOcedure; establishing police forces; training judges, prosecutors and defenders; and  developing adequate correctional facilities. 

  Using mandated force more effectively. There are some commentators who have concluded, 

  given the difficulties and constraints on use of force in UN operations, that these should be  confined to conventional, non-hostile situations or at least, to the extent that the UN does 

  undertake more ambitious, multi-functional operations such as UNTAC or ONUMOZ, that any 

  question of enforcement, even at the margins of the mission, be ruled out. I do not think that  this is realistic. The demands on the international community to play a role in bringing peace to  complex situations of conflict will not decline. The UN is certainly already becoming more  selective about the circumstances in which its peace keeping operations proceed, but it will not,  and in my view should not, vacate the field entirely . The more realistic challenge is to be clear " headed about the political and legal authority, the precision and feasibility of mandates and the  level of resources and organisation needed for operations to stand a good chance of success. 

  In his recent Supplement to An Agenda for Peace, the Secretary General concludes that 

  enforcement action is beyond the current capacity of the UN except on a limited scale. For the  immediate future, it is likely that many Chapter VII operations will be delegated to regional 

  arrangements or agencies, as Article 53 of the Charter contemplates, including to intem_ational 

  coalitions. This is clearly the sensible option for outright warfighting, as in the Gulf War. The  practical reality of limited capacity means it will also make sense in a range of other situations  such as in Operation Turquoise in Rwanda, where France undertook a forceful intervention  under Chapter VII which was followed by the deployment of the expanded UNAMIR operation  under Chapter VI; or with respect to the conflicts in Georgia and Tajikistan, where the UN's role  is essentially limited to monitoring activities which are well within the conventionally "

  accepted parameters of Chapter VI. 

  When the UN does undertake enforcement in the type of circumstances I have been discussing,  it must do so judiciously, in a way that does not damage the political aims of the overall UN  mission. To do so effectively, it is absolutely crucial that the UN address its current weaknesses  in command and control arrangements, in planning and organisation of operations and in 

  providing adequate resources to these operations. The workshop will address some of these

  issues tomorrow. 

  One particular area where the implications of the UN playing such a role need to be thought  through is its lack of rapid response capacity. There has been a flurry of recent proposals and  studies to consider how the UN could respond to crises more rapidly. Several Foreign  Ministers, including me, have commented that the UN's tardiness in . mounting an effective  operation in Rwanda in time to halt the genocidal killings there twelve months ago has  confronted us squarely with the need to reconsider the options, including the idea of a standing 

  force - which I, for one, had previously rejected as impractical. The proposals range from  Dutch Foreign Minister Van Mierlo's idea of a "UN fire brigade" to suggestions for enhanced  standby arrangements put forward by the Secretary-General and the Danish Government.  Canada is conducting an intensive study on how the UN's rapid deployment capacity could be 

  improved which is focusing on an early warning, integrated planning, logistics, command and 

  control systems, doctrine and interoperability. 

  Given all the familiar difficulties with standing force proposals of one kind or another, it may 

  well be that it is most sensible _ at this stage for us to focus squarely on how to improve the UN's 

  strategic military planning and direction capability (through the revival of the Military Staff  Committee or some other means), and its operational command capability - in particular the  ability to deploy Headquarters core groups which could set up operations at very short notice.  The establishment of this kind of capability would not be inconsistent with the eventual  establishment of a standing force, if that ever proved feasible, and in the meantime would  certainly assist greatly the development of a rapid reaction capability through enhanced 

  'standby' arrangements-the means presently preferred by the Secretary-General, and by most  of those member states sympathetic to the basic objective. 

  ill Using Force Without a Mandate 

  There remain some questions to be addressed about just how far a Chapter VI mandate should  be taken to reach so far as the use of force is concerned. The 'self-defence' issue has to be  addressed here, as does the more general question of how far a Chapter VI operation can and  should go in 'defending the mission'. 

  Self-defence. There is no doubt that self-defence is accepted as a permissible justification for 

  the use of force in operations based on consent. But there is no absolute guideline as to what  constitutes "minimum force and proportionate response" in self-defence. The experience of  Cambodia provided numerous instances when commanders and troops came under direct threat, 

  including from bombardment by Khmer Rouge artillery. At the end of December 1992,

  Bangladeshi peace keepers in Svey Leu were subjected to repeated shelling attacks. They sat 

  tight in their bunker for several days not returning fire while their withdrawal was negotiated. 

  They were eventually withdrawn, given that their work assisting electoral registrations was 

  largely complete. But when three months later, in Angkor Chun, also in the North, another 

  group of Bangladeshis was shelled, the peace keepers were protecting a major road near a main 

  town and their presence was considered essential to UNT ACs mandate. Therefore they 

  returned fire when attacked in accordance with the mission's ROEs. 

  To what extent do Rules of Engagement provide guidance to commanders and to peace keepers  in the field on the use of force in self-defence? ROEs have to provide effective guidance to all 

  levels within a peace keeping force. They therefore need to be as precise as possible. In 

  Cambodia for instance, in the case of crimes against humanity, the ROEs specified that "there 

  are also other criminal acts which, because of their gravity, warrant the use of all available 

  means to halt them". In the context of the UNTAC mission, these could include executions,  attacks on refugee columns, attacks on cantonment areas and on soldiers who have laid down 

  their arms and/or POWS under UNTAC care. Thankfully these provisions were not required 

  during UNTACs conduct but their existence assisted the force commander in planning for 

  contingencies. But even well-conceived ROE's are only a necessary, and not a sufficient, 

  element of guidance; the quality of training and leadership will always be critical. 

  Another consideration here is what arms are appropriate for peace keepers to bear. Decisions as 

  to what should constitute defensive weapons will vary from case to case, according to the nature 

  of the mission and the particular threats likely to eventuate. One approach might be to have  heavier weapons available in theatre, should they be required, but not necessarily deployed. 

  Defence of the mission. The concept of the use of :force to defend the mission is very difficult, 

  and even dangerous, to apply if there is a lack of clarity between different goals - such as, for 

  example, humanitarian assistance delivery and monitoring a ceasefire - because the use of force 

  may have varying and contradictory consequences for different aspects of the operation. The 

  importance of this element of certainty about a mission's objectives was demonstrated in 

  Cambodia where the force commander had a relatively clear brief, through the Security Council 

  resolutions and that the ROEs I have already mentioned, about the mission's purpose -assistance in establishing a recognisable legitimate authority capable of exercising sovereign 

  jurisdiction. This allowed him, quite properly, to resist strong pressure to pursue the Khmer 

  Rouge when they reneged on the Paris Agreement and began to attack UNTAC positions. 

  Although by no means simple, it is important to find agreement about the area (that is, beyond 

  self-defence and the defence of property) to which the use of force in defence of the mission 

  ............ 

  15 

  should apply. We need to be able to define what "mission" itself means. Is it essentially aâ‘ 

  physical concept? Does it include all personnel? Does it extend to all associated personnel, 

  such as staff of other parts of the UN system and NGO relief staff, perhaps along the lines of the 

  concept debated in negotiations of the newly adopted Protection of UN Personnel Convention? 

  Similarly, we need to agree about whether force is justified to defend only the basic goals of the 

  mission, or whether it is to be used to protect something wider - as an illustrative example, 

  would use of force to protect electoral centres in Cambodia, which were manned largely by 

  International Polling Station Officers who were not part of UNTAC, have been regarded as 

  legitimate given that UNTACs basic mission was to make possible the holding of free and fair 

  elections? And, if force is justified in either case, what measure of force should be used? Is a 

  demonstration of force justified whenever the credibility, and hence the authority and potential 

  vulnerability, of a peace keeping operation are at stake? 

  Taking all this together, this seminar might usefully consider whether the only general rule in 

  the use of force in Chapter VI operations is that each situation has its own logic and requires its 

  own reaction, or whether there are in fact some principles or guidelines - such as avoiding  escalation, applying the minimum force necessary and acting within the parameters of the 

  consent of the parties - which have universal usefulness. There are two particularly important 

  themes here which I think this seminar should continually keep in mind. 

  First there is the importance of a strong political underpinning for a peace keeping presence, 

  because peace keepers are more vulnerable without this and more likely to have their 

  impartiality compromised. The political nature of peace keeping (peace keepers, as Lt General 

  Sanderson has said, are "instruments of diplomacy, not war") demands responses on the lower 

  end of the scale of options for the use of force, otherwise options for graduated response are 

  limited. There is a need to maintain consent and acceptance of the peace making process, 

  bearing in mind that peace keeping operations are not ends in themselves, but squarely 

  designed to assist the essentially political and diplomatic process of securing lasting peace. 

  Secondly, there is the importance of an unambiguous legal basis for peace operations including 

  the authority to use force. Consent should be made concrete wherever possible through 

  specific host agreements and, in the case of intra-state conflicts, by the maximum express 

  commitment of all sides to the UN's presence. This won't necessarily make any easier the 

  question of what to do in the event of non-compliance with such commitments, but at least the â‘ 

  choices may be more starkly revealed - and the task of explaining to domestic publics why the 

  UN can or cannot act in particular situations made a little easier. 

  The basic conclusion which I believe should be drawn from all of this is that the principle of the

  non-use of force except in self-defence in peace keeping remains valid. It requires of peaceâ‘  keepers great qualities of restraint and the use by them of the minimum amount of force in those 

  instances of self-defence (or slightly more widely defined "defence of mission" situations) 

  when force is unavoidable. But there is consequently a vital need to distinguish clearly between 

  those responses that are appropriate to Chapter VI operations on the one hand, and those which 

  are appropriate under Chapter VII enforcement on the other. There should be no such thing as a 

  "Chapter VI lh" mandate: if a Chapter VII mandate is necessary in whole or clearly defined part,  for some operations it should be clearly given. 

  The virtues of clarity for all peace operations, in the form of a clear conceptual and legal  framework, should be evident not only to the tidy-minded but to all those who have to wrestle 

  with command and control arrangements and resource questions. One can hardly overstate the 

  importance of clarity and predictability on these matters - not least for troop contributing 

  nations' continued willingness to contribute to UN operations. The danger of loss of confidence 

  by the international community in the viability of peace keeping operations is currently very  real, particularly in the case of messy conflicts largely internal in character. What we do in 

  seminars like this is much more than of merely academic importance: the lives of a great many 

  people, I fear, are hanging on these kinds of deliberations and what comes out of them. 

  The important thing in these discussions is to move from generalised analysis and prescription  to specific, practically useful, proposals for decision and action. I am very much looking 

  forward to the ensuing discussion in the company of this highly experienced and expert group, 

  and hope that we will be able to develop agreement on specific conclusions which will inform 

  UN actions in the future.
