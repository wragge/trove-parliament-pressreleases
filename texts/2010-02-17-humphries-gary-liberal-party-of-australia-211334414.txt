 HOMELESS PLEDGE AMOUNTS TO $33 PER HOMELESS PERSON PER  YEAR

 Today's announcement by Kevin Rudd in relation to homelessness is yet another political announcement 

 designed for political capital rather than getting people off the streets.  

 "Kevin Rudd has clearly thought this one up overnight, designed for political outcomes rather than taking action 

 to reduce homelessness," Opposition Housing spokesman Gary Humphries said today.  

 "On the Government's own projections, this amounts to only $33 per homeless person per year - not enough to 

 buy a homeless person a roof over their head for one night, much less one year.  

 "This is hardly taking the matter seriously.  

 "This is a token commitment which makes a mockery of any serious plan to halve homelessness by 2020.  

 "Why should we take the promise to halve homelessness any more seriously than the promise to fix hospitals by 

 2009, to have a computer on every student's desk or to turn back illegal boat arrivals?  

 “Especially when we take into account, by the Prime Minister’s own admission, homelessness has actually risen 

 since making his pledge back in 2007.  

 "We have a Prime Minister using this issue for political advantage.  

 "We need real and practical solutions to combat homelessness and only a Coalition Government can achieve 

 this," Senator Humphries concluded.
