 PETER GARRETT MP 

 Member for Kingsford Smith 

 Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Reconciliation and the Arts 

 Keynote Address to the Australian Council of University Art & 

 Design Schools Annual Conference

 28/09/06

 ‘Today’s Philistines’ 

 The  idea  of  a  national  political  leader  championing  an  artist,  an  

 author or designer in 2006 seems almost absurd. 

 Politicians continually associate themselves with sport and sporting 

 success and yet at the national level are virtually absent from any 

 meaningful discussion or involvement with the arts.

 Consequently we lack a national debate about the current state of 

 health of the creative arts sector, including the future of our cultural 

 industries  where  a  number  of  key  areas  like  film,  dance  and  

 medium sized theatre are struggling.

 Australians have always produced and enjoyed art in all its forms, 

 from the poetry of Henry Lawson to the intense paintings of Imants 

 Tillers.  And  artistic  expression  has  always  been  central  to  

 Indigenous culture too. 

 2

 Although in earlier times distinctions were drawn between high and 

 low  arts,  towards  the  end  of  the  last  century  this  artificial  

 delineation was ebbing away. 

 That is until the arts became caught in the crossfire of the so-called 

 culture wars and anti-arts voices found space to air their views.  

 The  definition  of  philistine  is  someone  who  “expresses  opposition  

 to the liberal arts (and) resistance to government patronage of the 

 arts”.

 Today’s  political  philistines  are  not  all  necessarily  implacable  

 opponents  of  liberal  arts;  there  is  a  coterie  of  right-wing  

 commentators who fulfil that role. 

 Although  the  campaign  in  Federal  Parliament  several  years  ago,  

 led  by  prominent  government  members  including  Health  Minister  

 Tony  Abbott,  against  abstract  art  in  the  parliamentary  collection,  

 described  at  the  time  as  “avant-garde  crap”,  was  as  good  an  

 expression of philistinism as you’d ever see.

 Betty Churcher’s review of the politicians’ so-called concerns found 

 that some members simply “object to all abstract art - seeing it as 

 elite and not representative of broader Australia.”  

 I wonder how they explain the huge queues of people lined up to 

 see the Picasso exhibit in Melbourne recently.  

 3

 But  the  fact  remains  that  many  leaders  and  dominant  

 commentators  appear  indifferent  to  the  idea  that  Australia  should  

 aim to enlarge its artistic capacity, and willing, on some occasions, 

 to  reinforce  the  notion  that  somehow  the  arts  is  elitist  and  not  

 important to Australians. 

 I ask a simple question: can you remember the last time a senior 

 member of the Federal Government, with the exception of the soon 

 to  retire  Minister  for  the  Arts,  stood  up,  hand  on  heart,  and  

 declared  their  strong  support  and  unbridled  enthusiasm  for  

 Australian art and culture? 

 Can  you  remember  the  last  time  the  Prime  Minister  or  the  

 Treasurer  offered  up  their  view  on  the  value  of  creativity,  of  

 encouraging  expression,  of  the  importance  of  telling  our  own  

 stories?

 It  is  no  secret  that  the  number  of  unmet  invitations  to  senior  

 government  ministers  to  arts  events  continues  to  pile  up  to  the  

 roof. There is no ‘theatre tragic’ to equate with the Prime Minister’s 

 ‘cricket tragic’.

 Indeed  Sydney  Theatre  Company  director  Robyn  Nevin  made  

 headlines a few years ago when she observed that, “A new railway 

 can attract the presence of the Prime Minister…but the opening of 

 a  new  theatre…also  of  national  and  international  significance,  

 can’t.”

 4

 Yet  attendance  at  the  various  football  codes  is  de  rigueur  for  

 pollies of all persuasions.

 In July this year in the midst of yet another funding crisis besetting 

 the  esteemed  Sydney  Dance  Company  leading  choreographer  

 Graeme Murphy resigned in desperation saying, “How can the arts 

 flourish in a society where war and sport take centre stage?” 

 Notwithstanding  that  the  government  had  found  some  money  to  

 tide  them  over,  decades  of  trying  to  maintain  the  viability  of  a  

 leading  performance  company,  constantly  struggling  to  remain  

 afloat, had taken its toll on Murphy. 

 A  day  later,  and  amid  the  frenzy  created  by  the  Socceroos,  state  

 premiers and the Prime Minister agreed to provide joint support for 

 an Australian bid to host the football world cup.  

 Subsequently  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  reported  that  any  such  

 bid was expected to cost between $20 million and $30 million. The 

 irony  would  not  have  been  lost  on  observers  of  the  arts  scene  in  

 Australia - soccer 1, dance nil.

 It should go without saying that a wealthy country like Australia can 

 afford to support and encourage both fields of endeavour, but the 

 question  of  what  should  we  spend  our  money  on  and  should  we  

 consider greater investment in the arts, simply isn’t asked.

 I confess to enjoying a day out at the footy as much as anyone and 

 there  is  nothing  exceptional  about  this.  I’m  hoping  the  Swans  will  

 get up at the AFL Grand Final in two days time.

 But  as  long  as  there  is  an  absence  of  senior  political  voices  that  

 are willing to speak up for and defend the arts, it will continue to be 

 relegated to the periphery of the national debate.

 One consequence of the attacks on ‘cultural elites’ from the right is 

 that it has aroused latent hostility towards those who practise and 

 enjoy the arts.

 Of  course  it’s  an  easy  target  for  the  media  to  belittle  funding  for  

 experimental  art  and  the  constant  labelling  of  those  who  like  the  

 arts  as  the  ‘cafÃ©  latte  set’,  merely  “dabbling”  with  their  

 preoccupations  is  now  almost  an  article  of  faith  amongst  some  

 commentators.

 One  feels  there  is  also  a  lurking  suspicion  in  the  minds  of  

 electorally  sensitive  politicians  that  the  demise  of  Paul  Keating  

 came  about,  in  part,  due  to  his  role  as  the  last  national  leader  

 willing to champion the arts. 

 Of course it’s often the case that these same ‘cafÃ© latte’ artists are 

 speakers  of  their  ‘truth’,  who  are  often  fearless  in  their  

 representation  of  politics  and  society  and  on  issues  like  refugee  

 policy  or  Indigenous  affairs,  and  hence  the  indifference  swings  to  

 outbursts of enmity. 

 6

 It  was  no  coincidence  that  the  creative  community  was  amongst  

 those  most  opposed  to  the  government’s  sedition  laws  contained  

 in Anti Terror Bill No 2.  

 Labor  is  committed  to  repealing  this  aspect  of  the  government’s  

 legislation.  

 Despite an Australian Law Reform Commission report expressing 

 concern  at  the  sedition  laws  and  the  many  voices  raised  in  

 opposition the Attorney-General Mr Ruddock is pressing ahead.  

 -------------------

 Yet  Australia  stands  at  the  cusp  of  a  creative  renaissance  where  

 the  twin  forces  of  creativity  and  technology,  if  encouraged  and  

 harnessed, can transform our economy and enrich our culture. 

 The international experience is that people thrive on creativity, they 

 are  increasingly  engaging  in  the  arts  in  many  different  ways  and  

 along  with  what  are  described  as  the  ‘intrinsic’  value  of  the  arts,  

 there are also tangible economic benefits that accompany creative 

 output.

 Creativity is thriving in countries that value and support the creative 

 process.

 The UK, New Zealand and South Korea are just three examples of 

 countries  who  have  embraced  the  notion  of  building  creative  

 industries.

 7

 In  London,  as  Professor  Stuart  Cunningham  from  Queensland  

 University  of  Technology  has  noted,  the  creative  industries,  

 encompassing  fields  as  diverse  as  advertising,  software  design  

 and the traditional creative arts, come second only to the business 

 services  sector  in  terms  of  economic  growth,  generating  

 employment  for  around  600,000  people,  constituting  some  4%  of  

 the UK’s export income.

 The New Zealand film industry too is undergoing strong growth as 

 a result of the government’s targeting of the creative industries as 

 one  of  three  key  sectors  under  a  “growth  and  innovation  

 framework”; I seriously doubt we could easily make a Lord of the 

 Rings trilogy here. 

 What  is  clear  from  recent  research  is  that  the  creative  industry’s  

 contribution  to  things  like  employment  and  economic  activity  has  

 previously been underestimated.  

 With  a  wage  and  salary  figure  in  Australia  estimated  at  over  $20  

 billion,  those  employed  directly  within  the  creative  industries  as  

 well  as  those  in  creative  occupations  ‘embedded’  in  other  

 industries account for almost half a million jobs.   

 It is the case that there is exciting work happening on a number of 

 fronts  in  Australia.  And  we  have  our  share  of  outstanding  talents  

 including many who succeed abroad and given these figures, good 

 reason  to  energetically  develop  policy  which  promotes  creative  

 industries.

 8

 After calling for submissions to inform Federal Labor’s Arts Policy 

 Discussion  Paper  it’s  clear  that,  despite  the  presence  of  much  

 good  creative  work,  an  air  of  general  pessimism  pervades  the  

 sector.

 The  view  from  artists,  arts  entrepreneurs,  producers,  various  arts  

 organisations,  some  commentators  and  academics  was  that  the  

 Australian  arts  sector,  struggling  in  some  areas  as  a  creative  

 enterprise, is in danger of stalling. 

 And in the critical area of visual arts education, an issue that you 

 are  discussing  at  this  conference,  there  are  noted  and  serious  

 shortcomings in curricula, resources and approach.

 A  snapshot  of  the  arts  from  a  federal  perspective  in  2006  looks  

 something like this. 

 Federal funding remains on a relatively static track, and in the last 

 budget funding measures consisted mainly of what I’ve described 

 as repair and resuscitation.

 Once  you  take  away  overdue  infrastructure  repair,  maintenance  

 and  rescue  programs  for  those  crisis-ridden  parts  of  the  sector,  

 take away the ABC local drama fund, renewal of existing programs 

 and  the  establishment  of  yet  another  Canberra  institution,  the  

 ‘Gallery  of  Australian  Democracy’,  we’re  left  with  around  $  10  

 million  of  funding,  one  tenth  of  the  $100  million  figure  Senator  

 9

 Kemp  has  claimed  represents  the  Federal  Government’s  

 commitment to the arts. 

 Australia  runs  a  growing  deficit  in  cultural  goods  of  $2.7  billion  

 (2002-03),  and  the  proportion  of  direct  support  the  arts  sector  

 receives is miniscule. 

 The clear and present crisis in the areas of medium sized theatre, 

 film and medium sized dance require urgent attention.

 And  there  is  a  sense  of  bewilderment  that  at  a  time  of  relative  

 economic  prosperity,  for  many  artists  the  common  experience  is  

 living  in  a  state  of  perpetual  poverty,  with  a  miserly  average  

 ‘creative  income’  of  $17,000  p.a.  and  a  lack  of  opportunity  to  

 practice  that  which  they  have  prepared  and  trained  for  all  their  

 lives.

 The  opportunities  offered  through  employment  in  the  major  

 performing  companies  and  flagship  arts  organisations  are  the  

 exception rather than the rule. 

 Many artists live hand-to-mouth, week by week, and are still seen, 

 in some quarters, as lacking credibility because, it is asserted, they 

 don’t have a ‘real’ job.  

 And  the  welfare  system  which  many  artists  interact  with  reflects  

 this same prejudice. 

 10

 For arts entrepreneurs their challenge revolves around the barriers 

 to enabling dynamic arts activity, in film and media, to happen.  

 The  film  industry  which  relies  on  a  healthy  level  of  government  

 patronage at federal and state levels is at the cross roads. 

 It’s  a  cottage  industry  stuck  in  neutral,  with  fewer  and  less  

 successful films being made and a haemorrhaging of local talent to 

 offshore locations.  

 The  recently  announced  review  of  Australian  Government  Film  

 Funding Support by Minister Kemp comes at the eleventh hour and 

 is widely recognised as the last chance to revive this key industry. 

 There  are  bright  signs  with  the  emergent  games  and  digital  

 animation  industries  experiencing  strong  growth  and  increasing  

 capacity to export overseas.

 But the clear message from this industry is that they’ve done it in 

 spite  of,  not  because  of,  a  supportive  framework  from  within  

 Australia.

 For those industries that do operate within the global environment, 

 a  harmonisation  of  support,  taxation  and  regulatory  measures  

 which compare with our major international competitors is urgently 

 needed.

        So too there is a critical need to encourage and protect Indigenous 

 culture,  affirming  the  positive  role  it  plays  in  the  social  and  

 11

 economic  well  being  of  communities  and  in  enlarging  our  shared  

 sense of what it means to be Australian. 

 The  government’s  recent  decision,  announced  in  the  last  budget,  

 to  abandon  the  introduction  of  a  resale  royalty  right  for  visual  

 artists particularly disadvantages Indigenous artists, who, although 

 they often experience significant appreciation in the value of their 

 work, are denied the fruits of their talent.  

 Labor  would  introduce  a  resale  royalty  scheme  for  visual  artists,  

 and  ensure  Aboriginal  arts  centres,  which  play  a  critical  role  in  

 developing Indigenous art, are properly supported.  

 More importantly there is an urgent need to expand and encourage 

 greater investment into the arts so as to provide a greater level of 

 private as well as government support. 

 There  is  also  an  urgent  need  to  expand  the  research  framework  

 and  grants  programs  like  the  R&D  Tax  Concession  scheme  to  

 include  creative  projects  that  fall  outside  the  science  and  

 technology criteria. 

 Importantly  in  the  international  realm  we  need  to  remove  the  

 ideological  shutters  the  government  erects  in  relation  to  the  UN,  

 and  work  cooperatively  and  consistently  in  particular  at  the  

 General Conference of UNESCO. 

 It  is  extraordinary  that  Australia  was  one  of  four  countries  to  

 abstain  from  voting  on  the  Convention  on  the  Protection  and  

 12

 Promotion  of  the  Diversity  of  Cultural  Expressions,  which  was  

 supported by an overwhelming majority of states. 

       In  order  to  refresh  their  vision  and  produce  new  work  companies  

 and artists must take risks, and failure must be accepted as part of 

 that risk-taking; but the fiscal fragility that many arts organisations 

 face means that risk that doesn’t pay off in financial terms can be 

 fatal.

 Consequently Labor has identified the primary task for providing a 

 sustainable  framework  for  federal  funding  and  support  over  the  

 long  term,  and  to  move  away  from  the  cyclical,  crisis  driven  

 approach that has characterised funding of the arts sector over the 

 past decade and longer. 

 And in relation to the existing reviews being undertaken into school 

 music  education  and  now  visual  art  education,  where  discussion  

 papers  have  been  released,  stakeholders  consulted  and,  in  the  

 case  of  music  education,  summits  downgraded  to  a  ‘workshop’,  

 that  the  recommendations  are  acted  upon,  including  with  the  

 necessary resources. 

 Labor’s starting point is to recognise the work that artists produce 

 gives  an  immeasurable  sustaining  dimension  to  the  life  of  the  

 nation  and  that  the  arts  as  a  significant  field  of  endeavour  are  

 worthy of support in their own right. 

 13

 We  are  committed  to  expanding  the  scope  of  Labor’s  arts  policy,  

 which  has  previously  emphasised  creativity,  access  and  

 participation to include education, innovation and excellence. 

 We are resolutely committed to freedom of artistic expression and 

 to  strict  arms  length  funding,  recognising  that  both  private  and  

 public investment in the arts is critical.

 You would be well aware of the growing body of evidence showing 

 that  there  are  real  benefits  for  children  in  creative  learning  and  I  

 believe all Australian students should have the opportunity to learn 

 and  experience  creative  writing,  visual  arts,  film/video  making,  

 digital creation and crafts, music and performance whilst in school. 

 I am very mindful of the need for policy makers at federal and state 

 levels  to  now  consider  the  serious  shortfalls  in  the  provision  of  

 music  and  contemporary  visual  art  education.  This  is  important  if  

 we  are  to  encourage  a  lifelong  enjoyment  of  the  arts  and  create  

 future audiences and consumers of art. 

 It  is  also  important  that  students,  inhabiting  a  rapidly  changing,  

 digitally driven, multi faceted media environment, have the tools to 

 understand and utilise it. 

 --------------------

 In the absence of champions for the arts that can be called on to 

 advance  the  argument  that  Australia’s  well-being  -  cultural  and  

 economic - is linked to its creative vitality, the task of enlarging our 

 14

 artistic  reach  and  deepening  our  cultural  reservoir  is  that  much  

 harder.

 Yet  the  legacy  of  investing  in  and  supporting  art  and  artists  and  

 providing the means for people, especially young people, to grow 

 their arts experience, is immense.  

 And when the cheering in the sporting arena dies down the great 

 works of the imagination will remain. 

 They connect us to our past, they inspire us in the present, and no 

 matter  our  current  circumstances,  they  open  up  all  kinds  of  

 possibilities for the future.
