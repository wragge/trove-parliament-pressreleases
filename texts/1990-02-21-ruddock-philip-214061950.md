 PHILIP RUDDOCK Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

 l Î Î   MINISTER RAY BUNGLES AGAIN 111!

 I thought the Minister was bright.

 Not only has he bungled the implementation of Migration Legislative  Reforms, but he can't readl1l

 The Opposition's Economic Action Plan was very well detailed, and  on page 10 of the Supplementary Explanatory Notes are details of  the savings to be achieved on the immigration portfolio.

 None of the programs listed by Robert Ray in his Press Release ·   dated the 20th February 1990 (attached) are involved.

 The Statement said "Settlement and Ethnic Affairs Services which  are principally provided through grants to organisations and State  Government bodies have been exempted from cost recovery  arrangements and efficiency dividend savings."

 One of the telling points I have made in relation to the  Government's National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, is none  of the new expenditure initiatives were targetted in our  Economic Action Plan.

 Instead of scaremongering amongst Ethnic Communities, the Minister  would be better served in giving his full attention to the  administration of his portfolio in which he has proved to be so  lax.

 Perhaps the Minister is as rattled as his Prime Minister!11

 Settlement and Ethnic Affairs Services which are principally provided through grants to organisations  and State Government bodies have been exempted from cost recovery arrangements and efficiency  dividend savings. ,

 Cost recovery arrangements are an important component of the Department’s Budget. After changes  proposed the percentage cost recovered will still be below 50%. The adjusted outcome is as follows:

 OUTLAYS $144,747,000

 REVENUE $.69,154,000

 COST RECOVERY 47.7%

 Under Labor’s Budget this year, the percentage increase in fees for Migration and Visitor Entry was  42.8%.

 The M ini·ter for Immigration, Local Government; and Ethnic  Affairs* Senator Robert Ray* has called on the Opposition to  give d e ta ils e t the |20 m illion in cut· i t  says i t  would 

 make to the immigration p o rtfo lio  i f  i t  were In Government'

 Senator Ray laid  the Opposition's plan fo r the economy,  released in October la s t year# gave no d e ta ils  of which  program· would be cut back or ended, to enable i t s  420  m illion funding cut to immigration to go ahead*

 "The newke Government'· budget for the immigration p o rtfo lio   is  well documented*" the M inister said,

 '‘Given th at the Oppoeition has announced a major Out in ’  â pending on immigration, the Oppoeition immigration  spokesman, Mr Ruddock, should come clean and make public  the d e ta il· of hie program of cu t·.

 "At tha moment, we gen o n ly  g u e ·· where the Oppoeition would  cut, and th e ir options are very limited,*· * . .

 “They would find i t  very d if f ic u lt to ju s tify  a out to the 

 department'e immigration processing and visa issuing  operations because computerisation in those area» hae  resulted in a massive increase in productivity in recent  y ears. ,

 " It seems tha only area of immigration vulnerable to  the  Oppoeition'e reeor is settlement services, ' 1  Senator Ray  said'

 The M inister said migrant settlem ent services had grown  strongly under the Hawke Labor Government.

 The Government's to ta l settlem ent budget for 1989/60 was  1127,5 m illion, whieh wee 19 percent mere than in  1988/19,  and represented a 51 percent Increase on the amount  allocated to settlem ent in 1983/84.

 "Mr Ruddook must u l l  u i, for inetenoS, whether the Adult  Migrant Education Program, which had 70,500 migrants ?  learning English la s t year,  â¢aid. 

 is  on h is h it l i s t # 1 1  Senator Say

 "Would he out the community grant-in-aid scheme, which gives  maytimW p rio rity  to  the settlem ent needs of women and young  immigrants, refugees and to rtu re victims?

 "Would he out-bach the world-beating telephone in terp reter  Service, Which helps hundreds of thousands people each year.

 "Where w ill the Opposition are fe ll?  P h illip  Ruddock has  aoite hard questions to eniwer.

 "if he fails to  d e ta il where the Opposition would make i t s   outs to  immigration, he w ill confirm people's worst fear·  about C oalition plane for the immigration p o rtfo lio , *  Senator Ray said*
