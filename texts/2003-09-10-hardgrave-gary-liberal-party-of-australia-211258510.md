 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H126/2003 - 10 September 2003

 

 Guide To Help Migrants Understand Australian Law 

 A new initiative to help migrants understand Australian law and the role of police was  announced today by the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave.

 Mr Hardgrave launched A Guide to the Role of Police in Australia in Canberra today.

 The guide is designed to help newly arrived migrants understand their rights and  responsibilities under Australian law. 

 'It is vital that new migrants and refugees are provided with information on Australia's  policing processes and fundamental legal concepts, as they often arrive from countries with  vastly different legal systems and standards,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 'This is a practical, informative guide that outlines the criminal justice system in Australia,  provides a list of emergency service contact numbers, and highlights avenues of action for  victims of crime,' he said. 

 'Many recently arrived migrants may not be reporting crime because of a variety of cultural  reasons.'

 A Guide to the Role of Police in Australia was developed by the Australasian Police  Multicultural Advisory Bureau, with funding assistance from the Australian Government's  Living in Harmony initiative.

 ACT Policing's Acting Superintendent (Crime Prevention), Ben Cartwright welcomed the  launch of the guide.

 'It will help newly arrived migrants better understand Australian law, and this in turn supports  our efforts to provide a safer and more secure environment for the entire community,'  Superintendent Cartwright said. 

 Produced in English, Arabic, Afghani (Dari), Bosnian, Chinese (Mandarin), Persian (Farsi),  Somali and Vietnamese the guide is now available in PDF form from the Australasian Police  Multicultural Advisory Bureau web site in all eight languages at  www.apmab.gov.au/pubs/PoliceGuide.html.

 Mr Hardgrave said the guide was an excellent example of the commitment of Australia's  State and Territory police forces to the delivery of culturally appropriate, customer oriented  services to all Australians.

 'Strengthening relations between police, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities  is an important step towards ensuring that the needs of multicultural Australia are met, and 

 that community harmony continues to be achieved,' Mr Hardgrave said.
