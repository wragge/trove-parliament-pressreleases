 ASSISTANCE FOR ROHINGYA PEOPLE LIVING IN BURMA   

 Australia  will  provide  $3.2  million  in  humanitarian  aid  to  the  Rohingya  people  living  in  Burma’s   northern  Rakhine  State  to  improve  their  living  conditions  and  provide  them  with  better  economic   opportunities.   

 Australia  is  concerned  about  the  deteriorating  living  conditions  and  increasing  marginalisation  of  the   Rohingya people in Burma and in refugee camps in Bangladesh.    

 Their already parlous situation has been exacerbated by poor rice harvests, the rising price of basic food  items and enforced restrictions on their movements.    

 Australia remains committed to tackling these complex issues.    

 The humanitarian aid package I have announced today includes:   

 â¢ $1 million for food aid delivered through the World Food Programme  â¢ $1.2  million  including  for  the  delivery  of  basic  health  services  through  the  United  Nations   Development Programme  â¢ $1 million to improve rural livelihoods through CARE Australia.   

 Australia has supported the Rohingya people in Bangladesh and Burma for more than a decade.    

 This package builds on the $4 million in assistance Australia has already provided through the United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  and  takes  Australia’s  total  contribution  to  assist  the   Rohingya people to more than $8 million this financial year.   

 Australia’s direct support for the immediate needs of vulnerable people in our region is complemented  by  our  support  for  regional  dialogue  and  cooperation,  including  through  the  Bali  Process,  the  third   Ministerial meeting of which I am attending today with Senator Chris Evans, Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship and Mr Bob Debus, Minister for Home Affairs.
