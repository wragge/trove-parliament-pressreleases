 BUDGET 2002-2003

 MINISTER FOR DEFENCE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE & CUSTOMS

 SENATOR THE HON. ROBERT HILL SENATOR THE HON. CHRIS ELLISON

 JOINT NEWS RELEASE

 14 May 2002

 BORDER PROTECTION FUNDING BOOSTED

 The  Howard  Government’s  commitment  to  secure  Australia’s  borders  has  delivered  a  2002-03 Budget boost of $199.6 million over four years to ensure greater surveillance of our borders and an increased ability to control the illegal movement of people and goods.

 The Budget includes:

 â¢ An  extra  $175.8  million  over  four  years  to  Customs  for  more  Coastwatch  flights, communications, x-ray equipment, crews and evaluation of new technology options;

 â¢ An extra $22.3 million in 2002-03 for the Australian Defence Force to continue operations at our northern borders to deter unauthorised boat arrivals.  This is in addition to $18.7 million that was provided in 2001-02 for this initiative; and

 â¢ $1.5 million to the Australian Federal Police for five boats for the Indonesian National Police to assist their efforts in preventing people smuggling.

 Justice and Customs Minister Senator Chris Ellison said the comprehensive Budget measures would provide the men and women guarding our borders with state of the art equipment, training and more resources.   Senator  Ellison  said  the  2002-03  Budget  had  delivered  on  the  Howard  Government’s election commitments contained in its Protecting Our Borders policy.

 “The measures will improve Australia’s capacity to detect prohibited goods, including illicit drugs, and will enhance our detection of unauthorised arrivals, drug smugglers, illegal fishing and a range of other border threats,” Senator Ellison said.

 “Customs will provide more civil maritime surveillance than ever before, with Coastwatch’s flying hours increased by 1600 per annum. This allows Coastwatch to maintain its intensive program in the north and north-west, while still effectively managing other areas of Australia’s coastline.  More container and pallet x-ray equipment will allow better detection of prohibited goods that could be illegally transported by shipping consignments.”

 Defence Minister Senator Hill said the protection of Australia’s borders was one of the Australian Defence Force’s most significant responsibilities.

 “Defence patrol boats, maritime surveillance aircraft and intelligence capabilities are fully engaged in  the  day to  day monitoring  and  patrolling  our  maritime  approaches  against  encroachment  from external threats,” Senator Hill said.

 “These are tasks that our servicemen and women are trained, well-equipped and committed to do. Our  current  border  protection  operations  have  been  successful  in  deterring  unauthorised  boat arrivals since September 2001, intercepting more than 12 vessels in the first four months.  The extra money  in  the  Budget  will  be  used  to  continue  high  levels  of  coastal  surveillance  of  Australia’s northern approaches.”

 The  2002-03  Budget  also  includes  funding  to  allow  Defence  and  Customs  to  trial  the  high frequency  surface  wave  radar  that  provides  over-the-horizon  border  surveillance.   The  radar  can detect  surface  vessels  and  low-flying  aircraft  beyond  the  visible  horizon,  unlike  conventional radars, which are limited in operation to line-of-sight.  The technology will allow 24-hour wide area coastal  surveillance,  protection  of  fisheries  resources,  protection  of  offshore  oil  and  gas  assets, smuggling  deterrence,  illegal  entry  deterrence  and  it  will  facilitate  search  and  rescue  and  early storm warning.

 For a full list of measures in relation to both Protecting Australia’s Borders and Upgrading Domestic Security, please refer to Budget Paper Number 2, 2002-03.
