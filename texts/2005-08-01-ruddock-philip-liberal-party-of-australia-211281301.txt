 ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON PHILIP RUDDOCK MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPT   

 

 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW 

 HYATT REGENCY, ADELAIDE 

 10.30AM MONDAY 1 AUGUST 2005 

 

 Subject:  Jemaah Islamiyah and al Qaeda; David Hicks 

 

 JOURNALIST: Minister, firstly, could you tell us what you know of links between  Jemaah Islamiyah and al Qaeda?  RUDDOCK: Well, we know over a long period of time that al Qaeda has been  supporting and funding some of JI’s operations. 

 And, what we’ve learnt from the questioning on Indonesia is that  those linkages remain in place.  I don’t put a great deal of store in observations that suggest that  the justification for a terrorist attack can be related to any one  particular event, such as our engagement in Iraq.  We know that Australia was targeted by Jemaah Islamiah’s  operations well before 2001.  In fact, Australia’s interests, and  American and British interests were the subject of the planning of  a major terrorist operation in Singapore in the year 2000.  We know that many people left Australia well before 2001 to train  with al Qaeda.  We know that these organisations mutate and  change from time to time.  Their justifications for what they do  will often be related to our responses.  But we were on the horizon  long before we attempted to respond, and we would still be on  their horizon, even if we had never responded.  JOURNALIST: Now that this is confirmed though, what concerns does this, do 

 you have for the Australian security situation?  RUDDOCK Well I’ve made it clear over a period of time that we know we are  targeted, and that means a terrorist attack could occur in Australia 

 at any time.  I don’t, I don’t regard it as inevitable.  Some people do.  The  reason I don’t regard it as inevitable is I think we have to do  everything that we can possibly do to secure Australia from such

 an attack.  And, that’s what we are seeking to do - with good intelligence;  with an appropriate framework of law; with strong border  protection.  Another one of the matters that I noted, particularly given some  comments I made in the United States last week, about the extent  to which Australia had a better handle on movements in and out,  both lawfully and unlawfully than Europe and North America  have - there’s those who were saying, oh there’s Ruddock up to  his old tricks, blaming asylum seekers, asylum seekers would  never be involved in something like this.  Well, one of the tragedies that we see in the United Kingdom is  that some of those; at least one of those, is named as an asylum  seeker.  A number of the others are people who have been settled  in the United Kingdom as refugees.  They don’t have a refugee  resettlement program.  So you can only be speaking about people  who have made asylum claims.  And, all I say is, while there can be home-grown terrorists, strong  border protection has been one of the measures that we’ve had in  place that others are now looking at, to see whether they can  emulate it.  You have probably seen in the United Kingdom they’re now  talking about having alert systems attached to their databases  when people travel in lawfully.  We’ve had those sorts of alert  systems as part of our movement arrangements, long before I ever  became the Minister for Immigration.  JOURNALIST: Are you actually saying that we’ve been aware for some time that 

 bin Laden financed the bombing of the Jakarta Embassy…?  RUDDOCK:  No, I’m saying that it’s been well known that there have been  strong linkages between bin Laden and Jemaah Islamiyah over a 

 period of time.  That’s what I’m saying.  JOURNALIST:  Mr  Ruddock…   RUDDOCK:  So I’m saying that if somebody alleges that there was funding, 

 that doesn’t surprise me, given those linkages have exist for as  long as they have.  JOURNALIST: Mr Ruddock, Terry Hicks, you’ve just spoken with him about his  son, he’s said…  RUDDOCK:  Now we’re moving to a different issue are we?  JOURNALIST:  Sorry…   RUDDOCK:  Can I, can I - before we do, just see…  JOURNALIST:  …sorry  [indistinct].   RUDDOCK:  …well, we’ll just see whether the other matters are exhausted, and 

 then I’ll come to Hicks.

 JOURNALIST: Does it make any difference to whatever plans we have of going  back into Afghanistan?  RUDDOCK:  No.  In fact, I think our engagement there initially was very  helpful in substantially dismantling their effective operation, not 

 in its entirety, as we now know.  And the extent to which it has  been rebuilding is something that is of concern to us, and it’s one  of the reasons that we are actively engaged.  And when you know that there, and remain, continuing linkages  with JI, and this region, I think it ought to further validate the  decision we’ve taken. Okay?  Mr Hicks.  JOURNALIST: Now, yes, apparently a couple of the [indistinct] presided at the 

 tribunal have resigned.  The officers involved are saying that the  whole thing is a bit half-arsed, I think was one of their quotes, and  Terry Hicks this morning said this confirms more or less what he’s  been saying all along, that it’s a bit of a put up job this whole  military tribunal issue.  RUDDOCK:  Well, I would expect him to say what he’s been saying all along, 

 because, I mean, I guess his view is that [break in recording] one  can understand [break in recording].  I have broad responsibilities, and those responsibilities go to the,  go to the protection of the Australian community, as well as  accountability for actions that people take.  Now [break in recording] and unfortunately, when you go by one  news report, sometimes you don’t get the information accurately.  I initially thought from the news report that the suggestion was  that these were people who were formerly members of the body  that was going to try Mr Hicks, who were disaffected and making  some statements.  I now understand that that’s not the case.  They’re certainly not people that I’ve dealt with.  They’re certainly  not the major players in relation to the prosecution, and the  Americans have had something to say about the, about the  veracity of the comments that have been made.  My situation is quite clear.  The Americans have assured me that  they have a substantial case against Mr Hicks; that it needs to be  dealt with before a tribunal that can protect security-related  information; that in the context of war, war crimes tribunals have  always been the mechanism for securing that protection, as well as  bringing people to trial.  And in that context, while they are not  precisely the same as our civilian courts, dealing with criminal  matters, they are an appropriate medium for doing so.   Now there are some people who are wanting to attack them, and  some people who will say almost anything about them.  There are  good reasons for using a military commission process, when we 

 Attorney-General Transcript  3 

 are still engaged against al Qaeda.  And, and the fact is, some of  the evidence that will undoubtedly have to be adduced, is from  people who have been engaged in those matters.   And whether you put that into the public arena is a significant, a  significant matter [break in recording].  …dealt with some of those matters [break in recording], want to  say the same thing, at this stage I can’t [break in recording].  …that any trial is fair.  Mr Hicks has [break in recording], and I  have to say, from what I have [break in recording]…  …in reasonably good shape, and [break in recording], subjected to  abuse, who has been a [break in recording] at Guantanamo Bay  [break in recording]…  …happy about it.  Look I, I am not happy about the fact that an  Australian was in the situation where he [indistinct], and where  the prospect of him being charged and found accountable for  actions he’s taken, looms large.  JOURNALIST: But you’re happy with the process [indistinct]?  RUDDOCK:  Look, I understand the reason for the process, and I, I simply say 

 that when you have the two overriding objectives that are  competing - (1) to give people a just trial, but (2) to protect  security-related information that might help in dealing with  terrorist threats that we face, you have to try and achieve both,  and the military commission becomes the most effective way of  being able to do that.  JOURNALIST: Were you briefed on the situation while you were in Washington 

 Minister? 

 RUDDOCK:  No I wasn’t, but…  JOURNALIST: Should you have been?  RUDDOCK:  Well, if other people knew of it, perhaps, but I only learnt of it this  morning when you did. 

 JOURNALIST: And what next then, will you be pursuing this matter?  RUDDOCK:  Well, obviously in relation to matters where certain claims are  made, before I speak at them, or speak on them at length, I like to,  I like to get further advice.  And that’s what I’m pursuing. 

 I’ve answered those questions that I believe I can answer, with the  information that’s available to me.  Okay?  JOURNALIST: There’s mounting evidence though that Hicks will face an unfair  trial.  Is the US denying…  RUDDOCK:  No, I don’t think there is at all.  I think there is a, there is a trial 

 that we want to see occur as quickly as possible.   There are some people who have a view that it doesn’t really  matter if you put people to their trial and compromise security-related information, which may save people’s lives.

 There are some people who think that putting all those things into  the public arena is the only way in which you can deal with these  questions.  And I’m saying, you need to be able to deal with both,  and that’s why the military commission process is appropriate.  Okay?  JOURNALIST: Would you hope the trial occurs this year, or when would you 

 hope it occurs? 

 RUDDOCK:  Well look, the Americans tell me that if there are no further legal  challenges likely to delay it, that it could be on as, in as short a  time as three weeks.  And that’s where I’d prefer to see it be, but we’ve seen to date that  challenges by Mr Hicks - he has a habeas corpus challenge before  the American courts - challenges by Mr Hamden, who was  another person who is slotted for a military commission trial, have  been the reason for the delay up till this point in time.  Alright?  Thank you.
