 Timeline for Processing Mr Chen’s Protection Visa Application 

 VPS 071/2005

 Far from ‘dithering’ over Mr Chen’s protection visa application, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs was  processing the application as a matter of priority, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today. 

 ‘Mr Chen’s protection visa application was lodged on Friday 3 June and is being processed in a normal manner, but as a priority,’ Amanda  Vanstone said. 

 ‘My Department contacted Mr Chen and his representatives early the following week.

 ‘He was offered the opportunity to present his claims at a protection visa interview later that same week. (Week ending 11 June)

 ‘Mr Chen requested that the interview be deferred to a later date as they required further time to prepare,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 Following the interview, DIMIA will follow the normal processes in establishing Mr Chen’s claims for a protection visa. 

 DIMIA processes several thousand protection visa applications each year. 

 There are well defined processes in place to do this in a way which is speedy while ensuring that individual applicants have a fair hearing.

 Each application is considered on its merits.
