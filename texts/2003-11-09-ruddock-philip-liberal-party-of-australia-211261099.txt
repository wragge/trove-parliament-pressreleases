 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON PHILIP RUDDOCK MP 

 

 NEWS RELEASE   

 9 November 2003 R021/2003 

 

 OPPOSITION OWN-GOAL ON BORDER PROTECTION   AND NATIONAL SECURITY 

 It was gratifying that the Opposition has finally acknowledged the potential for a  link between border protection and national security the Attorney-General, Philip  Ruddock said today. 

 “The Shadow Attorney-General told the Sunday program today that terrorists could  be coming in with unauthorised boat arrivals, thereby posing a threat to Australia,”  Mr Ruddock said. 

 ‘Indeed they could be carrying terrorists. To say to a boatload look, if you’re a terrorist and  you want to come into the country, come into one of the small islands because we really can’t  protect it, is quite frankly surrender.’ (Robert McClelland, Sunday program 9/11/2003) 

 “This is in stark contrast to their position during the last election campaign with the  then Opposition Leader Kim Beazley dismissing similar suggestions when appearing  on ABC TV on the 25th of September 2001,” Mr Ruddock said. 

 “The Government has always taken the view that we need to be prudent and have  appropriate measures in place to protect the Australian community across a range of  possible threats. 

 “However, the Opposition seems to still have a different view with the statement  from the Shadow Minister for Immigration, Nicola Roxon that downplays the need  for border protection,” Mr Ruddock said. 

 “We don't think it's the appropriate time to protect our borders as the Government keeps  saying…” (Nicola Roxon, ABC 5/11/2003) 

 “It is quite clear the Labor Party doesn’t know what to think and still does not  understand the importance of border protection and national security,” Mr Ruddock  said.
