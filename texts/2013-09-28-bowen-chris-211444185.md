 CHRIS BOWEN MP  Interim Leader of the Opposition  Member for McMahon   

 

 MEDIA STATEMENT   

 ASYLUM SEEKER DEATHS    

 On behalf of the Opposition, I wish to extend our condolences to the families who have lost  loved ones off the south coast of West Java.   

 Our thoughts are with them and with our Australian Naval and Border Protection personnel  who continue to operate in such treacherous conditions.   

 In line with the standard outlined by the Minister for Immigration earlier this week, with  significant search and rescue events involving Australian personnel, we expect timely  statements and media briefing from the Government. This was a standard set by the former  Government.
