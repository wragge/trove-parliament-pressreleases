 Villawood escapes - 23 through fence

 News conference at Villawood 12 midday - 22 July 2001

 Minister: Well good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As you know, as has already been reported, 23 detainees last night escaped from this facility. And this follows on an escape by another group of detainees last week. You can imagine I am not happy about that outcome. But the advice that I have received this morning suggests we are dealing with two separate situations.

 Last week's was a well planned and well executed operation involving a large number of detainees… other excluded from it, but a large number of detainees… as I said last week, probably with some outside assistance. What we have seen here last night was an opportunistic event.

 That doesn't mean to say that somebody didn't have some tools and wasn't able to prepare for what happened. There may have been some preparation by one or two individuals over a period of time, but there had been movement of detainees and people didn't necessarily know they were going to be in this area and we believe many of the people who have decamped on this occasion simply took the opportunity of the activities of one or two others to escape.

 Now there some issues in relation to that that you should be aware of. There were a number of people injured… they have been cut… perhaps quite significantly so. The crime scene that's being investigated at the moment would suggest that there are people who have left with injuries. People have been seen in the area, at large and that suggests that they've perhaps disappeared in many different directions… each making their own way. The advice that I have received is that it is likely, given the opportunistic nature, that our compliance activities will probably locate numbers of people fairly shortly.

 It is important… because some people will endeavour to try to characterise these sorts of events as being people who ought to be seen as heroes who have escaped detention and that they are people who should be in some way even encouraged and supported in having left lawful custody. I just want to make it very clear that we are not dealing with refugees. As I've said before, we do not detain refugees. Of this group of people, only four have accessed the protection visa system... in other words, only four have made claims that they might have refugee entitlements that should be examined.

 Of those, three have been concluded and have been through all of the systems… and you know I am of the view that the systems we have are unduly long in terms of the amount of time that it takes to resolve matters finally . They involve not only decision making by the Department but they involve decision making by the Refugee Review Tribunal and people accessing the courts and also accessing me to put humanitarian claims and in some cases going off to the United Nations. People can test… and do... claims at great expense to the Australian community, even when it is quite clear and manifest that they have no claims.

 Now what does that mean about the balance? Well, we are dealing with, I think it is something of the order of eight PRC nationals..., eight Vietnamese nationals, an Indonesian. These are people who have been detained in our normal compliance operations. Some of them apprehended by the police.

 A small number, but never-the-less, a number who were being dealt with under character issues. In other words, in one case, a person who had committed quite serious criminal offences involving drugs. In another case, a person a person who had committed criminal offences involving robbery and violence… and in another case, a person who had been involved in matters relating to domestic violence. So we are dealing with groups of people who are in immigration detention because they are unlawfully in Australia and are to be removed. In fact one person was intended to be removed today.

 So it is very important to understand that we are not dealing with something that ought to be characterised as people who have been victims of persecution in some other parts of the world... who are being unreasonably detained here and are being unreasonably dealt with. Nothing could be further from the truth.

 Other than that you will no doubt ask me about the ongoing detention arrangements and so I'll deal with a couple of aspects. First, I appointed an independent investigator in relation to these matters who will be reporting to me and I will be expecting recommendations which will obviously require my early attention when they are concluded. Probably within a week.

 That I hope will give me some guidance in relation to the way in which the facility itself fulfils its purpose… in other words as to whether there are aspects to the physical security arrangements that need to be reviewed.

 I imagine that he will also be reporting to me on issues relating to the way in which personnel carry out their functions here as well. I don't intend to prejudice those inquires by commenting on them but needless to say I am very angry that a facility that should fulfil a purpose of ensuring that we are able to manage orderly immigration programs is not doing that when escapes of this sort occur and I am more angry when I think that people who may

 pose character issues are allowed to be at large.

 It is just not acceptable to me that we can have a situation where we people of character concern can leave a facility and in circumstances that have occurred here.

 Finally, the police.. both the State Police and Commonwealth Police treat these as major criminal investigations and I made the point before that if we find that there are people outside who have facilitated these escapes in any way, we will certainly ensure that the full force of the law which has recently been enhanced to deal with these issues has been brought to bear.

 Now are there any questions?

 Question: Are you embarrassed to be here today?

 Minister: I don't get embarrassed.

 Question: Minister you say it probably wasn't organised.. do you think that once these people got out through the fence have literally have just spread through the suburbs or have been effectively picked up in cars and trucks and buses…

 Minister: There are a number of sightings and that would suggest they are simply at large. Look people may have some contacts within the community and no doubt they will try and reach those but I don't tend to comment about that and they're issues that we will be following up with our own compliance activity and it is important to be able to deal with the information we have and then follow up all of those inquiries.

 Question: Was it an error to transfer the management of these centres to private hands?

 Minister: As you know I have not been commenting on the contractual arrangements because ultimately we have determined to test the market to see whether we are getting best value for money and there are a range of issues that fly from that.

 The previous arrangements… and it's important to recall what happened…. when we decided to test the market to see whether or not the services could be more effectively carried out it was against the background… and I am not in any way reflecting upon the professionalism of Australian Protective Services when I say this… but there had been a series of breakouts from detention centres and they were breakouts that occurred when we had smaller numbers of people than we are holding now… and they occurred over a period of time.

 I only make that point because it's important to understand that if you're dealing with people who don't like being detained, they will test your capacities in relation to this matter. Now the fact is we did have breakouts before. We are still having breakouts. As I say I am not happy that it happens and one seeks to learn from every incident to ensure that you minimise the possibilities for those sorts of activities to be undertaken by detainees that can breach our security.

 Question: Minister didn't we learn our lesson from Thursday's breakout?

 Minister: I've been briefed on what happened today. Thursday we dealt with a very well planned, fairly sophisticated operation involving a large number of people… in a covert operation over some weeks. Last night we have dealt with an incident involving one or two people, in which others have opportunistically been involved. It has been a breach of the security of the facility and I will get a full report on that in time.

 Question: Minister are the contractual arrangements under review?

 Minister: Yes they are.

 Question: Minister when it was opportunistic has something that was unusual happened in the facility overnight that probably wouldn't normally have been the case and allowed this to happen?

 Minister: I don't believe so and the reports that have been given to me today… it was an incident that people were able to breach a number of fences.. including a palisade fence and I have seen how that happened. They certainly went through the razor wire and a number of people have been quite significantly I think injured by that. I mean there was an amount of blood on the site… clothes that were bloodstained and so on. It was an opportunistic escape, but whether or not… Look I will get from the security specialist that we have asked to look at these matters… a report that will deal with the physical environment, that will deal with the manning issues and then I'll be able to make a more considered judgement about it.

 Question: Is it absolutely certain that it's all males that got out… there are no females who escaped?

 Minister: I mean we do head counts and identify who are missing and the advice to me was that it was 23 males.

 Question: Is there any suggestion that women and children got out in the past two escapes?

 Minister: No.

 Question: Can you tell is exactly how they got out… how much wire they had to get through? Did they tunnel under the wire?

 Minister: No. There was a… look we'll get somebody to give you some greater detail about that later in the day. There is what is called a courtesy fence to keep people away from the palisade fences and to let them know where they should go and where they shouldn't go. The chain wire for that was cut. The linkages where it abuts the fence. There is a palisade which is a vertical metal post… but it's not into the ground… it's part of the picket in the palisade that was in fact cut. that had been hacksawed through and the picket.. the palisade bent so that people could pass through it. Thereafter there is an area which is secure and essentially quarantined from people being able to use the area in which there is razor wire laid on the ground and there is a fence before and after it. Again the chainwire fencing before and after had been cut and the razor wire parted in order to pass through.

 Question: Is that an area where a new fence had recently been built?

 Minister: Yes.

 Question: To get through a palisade fence.. that sounds like a pretty hard task… are you amazed at how they've been able to do it or do you think someone's given them tools?

 Minister: Look there's undoubtedly tools that have been available and that can arise in a number of ways. The fact is that this centre has something like two or three hundred visitors a day over a weekend. People can bring items like that in with them. You know that one of the things I have been anxious about has been having adequate search powers not only in relation to detainees, but also in relation to those who visit detainees.

 Tools could have come that way. This has been a construction site as well and it's believed that some tools may have gone missing. There have been a number of searches to try to locate the items. It is at times.. and I've seen this as well… you know some of the tunnelling that was recently undertaken, was undertaken with knives and forks. So you know.. I mean we talk about it being fairly sophisticated, but when you see the knives and forks and garden trowels and as well as a couple of hammers and so on… chisels … These are the sorts of items that were used. That's why it took so long. But it was a well kept secret amongst those who were participating in that breakout. But that is not what happened last night.

 Question: Whenever there is an escape or breakout, you simply say there will be a review. Will you ever be able to go any further and do something solid about it because 46 people getting out in three or four days… surely if that happened in a state detention centre, things would happen much more dramatically.

 Minister: You would be very concerned if it happened in a jail and the point that I've made over a period of time is that we have to get a balance in relation to these matters and part of the balance for administrative detention is that you're not punishing people. They are not jails. One of the risks you run is that you are more likely to see escapes, but you do need to be able to manage different populations and some of the people who have been detained are of character concern. So this facility has a range of detention capacities, some of which is a relatively high order and some of which is largely reliant upon detainees cooperating.

 Look it is the case that we have seen people behaving in different ways and we have to take into account now, in relation to the review that is being undertaken, the extent to which some of the amenity of the facility has to be compromised to maintain security. That's what we are going to have to look at.

 You say will there be action? Of course there will be action. The action will deal with the recommendations that come from the security review.

 Question: Will you now consider separating those detainees who are due to be deported… who have had their claims rejected… from those who are still waiting to hear on their application? That was one of the recommendations from the parliamentary committee. Is that something you will now seriously consider?

 Minister: Well It's not an issue that arises here.

 Question: But a lot of these were to be deported - there was one today.

 Minister: That's right. You say separate them out from those who are having their claims considered. There was only one person amongst all of the people who have escaped who is having a claim considered. Only one.

 Question: With their criminal backgrounds… are you concerned about these people now out in the community.

 Minister: I am. I am very concerned and I make the point very very strongly that detention is public policy for good reason. It is to ensure that people who have no lawful basis to be here are available for removal. I mean that's the purpose. And the purpose in relation to those who are of character concern is to ensure that those who pose a risk to the Australian community are available for removal.

 Question: What confidence can the Australian people have in your management if these incidents keep happening?

 Minister: They can have this confidence. The arrangements are being fully reviewed and I will have some further comments to make towards the end of next week. To the extent to which the amenity of the centres themselves may have to be compromised to ensure that the principle task is met.

 Thank you.
