 Baxter Immigration Detention Facility

 VPS 148/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today welcomed the decision of some of the men conducting protest action at the Baxter Immigration  Detention Facility to end their action.

 The Minister stressed no undertakings had been given to those withdrawing from the protest.

 ‘The Government abhors these sorts of actions and I encourage anyone still engaging in such action to stop immediately,’Minister Vanstone said.

 ‘These actions are futile. They will not influence government or departmental decisions on individual cases.

 ‘ The detainees who are engaging in the action are not refugees. They have been found not to be owed protection through an exhaustive and fair  determination process and subsequent reviews including, in some cases, judicial review.

 ‘My department is handling this matter in a professional and sensitive manner.

 ‘As has been made clear all along, my department has in place the appropriate people and processes to deal with these situations. 

 ‘Advocates have exacerbated this situation with the untrue and exaggerated claims, which may have falsely raised the hopes of people in  immigration detention.

 ‘I have said in the past and repeat today, that such comments could be inflammatory and ultimately lead to an incident which is in nobody’s  interests.

 ‘Calls for an independent review of medical facilities do not do justice to the highly professional medical and health staff we have on site and  community doctors who treat detainees as needed.

 ‘Appropriate medical support and counselling is available to all detainees, including those involved in protest action.

 ‘Once again, I strongly urge those still involved in this futile action to cease immediately.’
