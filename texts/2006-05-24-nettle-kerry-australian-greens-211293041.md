 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Greens condemn political decision to reject West Papuan  asylum seeker. 

 Senator Nettle, 24th May 2006   

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today condemned as 'politically motived' the decision to  reject the asylum claim of the last remaining West Papuan refugee on Christmas  Island.    

 "The Australian public will see this decision for what it is; a politically motivated  attempt to placate the Indonesians," Senator Nettle said.    

 "This man has one of the strongest cases for asylum being the son of one of the most  prominent leaders of the West Papuan Independence movement Thomas Wainggai  who died whilst languishing on a life sentence in an Indonesian prison after raising  the West Papuan flag.    

 "He has been rejected on the basis of a flimsy technicality which the Minister must  know will not stand up to much scrutiny.    

 "Mr Wainggai is now doomed to remain alone on Christmas Island whilst he waits for  his case to be appealed at the refugee review tribunal.    

 "The Greens condemn this act of appeasement as another example of the  government's willingness to put trade and security relationships above human rights."
