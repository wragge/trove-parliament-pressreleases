 MINISTER ATTENDS AUSTCARE REFUGEE WEEK

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, urged Australians to learn about refugee issues during Austcare Refugee Week, which starts tomorrow.

 “There is much debate on detention of unlawful arrivals at a time when the focus should be on the 20 million refugees and others in humanitarian need around the world today that need our help,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “Australians can support the Government’s commitment to the international community’s efforts to resolve refugee problems by participating in Austcare Refugee Week.”

 “By raising money and awareness during this week, groups and individuals can reach out to those in need.  The plight of refugees concerns us all, and when positive action is taken to help, everyone benefits.”

 Mr Hardgrave, who will speak at the Austcare Refugee Week launch in Adelaide tomorrow, said the annual event signalled the start of a series of activities held across Australia, including lectures, festivals, exhibitions, competitions, conferences and picnics.

 “These activities develop greater awareness of refugee issues in the community, acknowledge the contributions refugees make to our society, and provide an opportunity for Australians to make a real difference,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 Mr Hardgrave said Australia had a long and proud history of resettling refugees and others in humanitarian need.

 “Since 1945, more than 600 000 refugees and displaced people have been resettled in Australia,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “Under the Humanitarian Program, the Government will continue to give priority to people who are in the most vulnerable situations and have the greatest need for resettlement places.”

 Mr Hardgrave will speak at the launch of Austcare Refugee Week at 12.30pm on Saturday 5 October at Gilles Street Primary School, 91 Gilles Street, Adelaide.
