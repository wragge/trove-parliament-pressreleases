 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 I’m absolutely delighted to be able to introduce to you two exciting young Canberrans who  have been chosen today by the Liberal Party to contest the federal seats of Canberra and  Fraser at the election this year. Giulia Jones and James Milligan are two committed residents  of this city who want to fly the Liberal flag and show the people of Canberra that there is a  better way of running the country than the way that Kevin Rudd is running it. It’s a great  pleasure to have these two people working with me in this coming election campaign. Giulia  Jones will be familiar to many of you; she is going to take up the fight that she left off in  2008 in the Assembly election. She’s a professional, working mum and she believes  passionately in the welfare of the people in this city. James Milligan is a small business-person who has lived and worked in this city. He has a business here and raising a family  here and very much wants to give the people of Fraser better representation than they’ve had  in the last few years. These two people are going to be working very hard through the  campaign and you’ll see a lot of them. They intend to demonstrate that the seats of Canberra  and Fraser are not locked up for the Labor Party but are very much open territory in this  coming election. I’ll ask Giulia to say a few words.   

 GIULIA JONES:   

 Thank you and I am looking forward to putting myself out there to the voters of the seat of  Canberra. Canberra does not belong to the Labor Party. I’m a working mum and I know what  it’s like to do your grocery shopping at ten o’clock at night so that you can fit everything in. I  think the people of Canberra need someone out there who knows their concerns and I’m  going to be listening to them.   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 James.   

 JAMES MILLIGAN:   

 I am truly honoured today to have been endorsed by the Canberra Liberals. I am really  looking forward to getting out into the community, listening to people’s concerns and  listening to small businesses’ concerns.   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 Thanks, very much. The campaign starts from today, the Labor candidates and the Labor  Party have no doubt taken these seats for granted for a long time, but I can assure you that’s  very much going to be in contention in the coming few months.   

 QUESTION:   

 You say that the Labor Party’s taken these seats for granted, but they are held by considerable  margins. Given the time, money and effort that goes into these campaigns, is it worth it? It’s a  mighty fight. 

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 It absolutely is worth it. Canberra and Fraser have been represented for too long by absentee  candidate, people who aren’t seen, aren’t active in the communities. The people of Canberra  have been taken for granted for too long. These seats are certainly in need of good  representation by local people who understand local issues. We’re going to get out there in  shopping centres, doorknocking, taking issues up to the people of Canberra and providing  them with a real alternative. I’m confident that we have here real candidates much better able  to do that job than Labor’s candidates.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think that Liberal Party policy is endeared Canberrans to the Coalition?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 I think Canberrans like anybody else in this country are appalled by the waste and  mismanagement that we’ve seen under the Rudd Government. They are a government that  talks a lot but just doesn’t deliver, a government who have shown themselves capable of  wasting colossal amounts of public money. The people of Canberra know how Government  works and they know that what they’re getting is very bad Government and a very  incompetent government. I think they will appreciate candidates who’ll support a government  who will make a real difference in terms of the better running and the better spending of  taxpayer’s dollars.   

 QUESTION:   

 My question’s to the two candidates. Senator Gary Humphries and his leader, Tony Abbott  want to take a razor gang to the public service in Canberra. They’ve already confirmed that  they want to cut 12,000 jobs do you support Senator Humphries and your leader, Tony  Abbot. Is that what you’re going to campaign on, slashing the public service? 

 

 GIULIA JONES:   

 Let’s get one thing straight. There are no public service job cuts. No-one is going to lose their  job as a result of this policy. We have got the biggest deficit that we have had since World  War II and we cannot keep pumping more money out that does not exist. As a result, there  will be a process of natural attrition for two years under which we will be able to consolidate 

 the amount of money that we spend on the public service.   

 QUESTION:   

 So you do agree with that then?   

 GIULIA JONES:   

 I think that if there’s no money, you can’t pay for things.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think that there’s much room for cutting, is there much fat in the public service?   

 GIULIA JONES:   

 I think that people who work in the public service in Canberra are great, hard working people  and we need to stand up for them. That’s why we’ve gone for a policy of natural attrition.   

 QUESTION:   

 Another issue that isn’t too popular here is the refugee and the asylum seeker issue. We’ve  seen a policy that was announced only two days ago which may be popular more broadly but  probably isn’t going to find large amounts of support inside Canberra. Do both of you stand  firmly behind that policy and do you believe that TPV’s are part of the solution?   

 GIULIA JONES:   

 We need to deny people smugglers a product to sell. It’s not right that they take advantage of  people who are in desperate circumstances and that’s why we announced the policy that we  have.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think it’s going to be popular in Canberra? Will it help or hinder your campaign?   

 GIULIA JONES:   

 I think that people know what’s right deep down and I think that they would agree that we  need to deny people smugglers a product to sell.   

 QUESTION:   

 My question is to James. When you signed up for the Liberal Party and indeed to be a  candidate, did you see that the Liberal Party as it’s been mooted in the media is going to be  an action replay of the Howard Government? 

 

 JAMES MILLIGAN:   

 What Tony Abbott is doing with the party right now and the polices that he’s putting forward  are the polices that I would support and I will be doing what I can to promote the messages  that he’s trying to put forward in his policies.   

 QUESTION:   

 In the Party Room, there is a strong belief - which there wasn’t 6 months ago - that the  Liberal Party can win. Given the events of the last two weeks, with gospel truths and  carefully scripted remarks and passports, do you still believe that the Liberal Party can win? 

 Is this a two horse race?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 It most certainly is. This is a race that has very much changed in the last 6 months.  Australians are realising that the bright shiny Kevin Rudd that they voted for in 2007 isn’t  quite the Kevin Rudd who is leading the Government to an election victory in 2010...   

 QUESTION:   

 ...but is the Tony Abbott in the last 2 weeks, is that the same Tony Abbott. Has the shine and  the gloss gone?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 I don’t think so. I think we’re seeing Tony Abbott taking the issues up to the Labor Party and  to Kevin Rudd. He has changed the landscape of this election because he has been able to  demonstrate that what Kevin Rudd is doing is actually not just broken promises, not just all  talk no action but it’s actually incompetent mismanagement of the taxpayers dollars. Nobody  likes to see that kind of Government run.   

 QUESTION:   

 Senator, will the Liberals be pushing precisely the same resources into both campaigns.  Fraser is substantially out of your reach whereas Canberra, whilst it is a tough ask, is  substantially closer. Will these be treated as two equal campaigns?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 We’ll be giving both seats, as well as the Senate campaign every effort we can. We’re going  to be fundraising; we’re going to be doorknocking, letterboxing out in shopping centres. We  will have a profile in these seats that the Labor Party hasn’t engineered in Canberra for a very  long time. Ask yourselves when have you seen any of the federal Labor members for the  ACT in a shopping centre somewhere that these candidates and myself will be doing and  have been doing. That’s the measure of the campaign that we’ll be pushing out there and  we’re going to make this a very, very real fight. If Labor think these seats are locked up, I’d  suggest to them to think again!   

 QUESTION:   

 Is it a 50/50 proposition or will you be focusing your effort and your resources on Canberra?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 We see all of these seats as being important and all of them are winnable. Every effort will be  made to ensure that people that live in Canberra and Fraser have real choices this year. It will  be a very determined campaign where every resource will be thrown to make sure that people  understand the choice that they have.   

 QUESTION:   

 Yesterday, it’s come out that the ALP has endorsed via Karl Bitar a fake Twitter account  under the name of “phony Tony” what are your thoughts on a political party endorsing a fake  twitter account to uphold the gospel truth in politics.   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 I think what we’re going to see from the Labor Party in particular is a very dirty campaign, a  very personal campaign targeting Tony Abbott. We’re going to see a lot of misinformation  and the use of taxpayers dollars to buttress the Labor Party’s arguments in this campaign.  Watch out for misinformation big-time from a very frightened and scared Government. We  intend on keeping the facts in front of voters. Giulia and James will be doing their best to  help me make sure that people have in front of them what’s really happening to rising prices  under Labor and where the facts lie. It’s going to be a tough job but we’re going to make sure  it happens.   

 QUESTION:   

 You’re putting the boot in as well though, the last ad that the Liberals unveiled is certainly  satirical but it doesn’t shy away from putting the boot into Kevin Rudd and quite personally  as well. Can you really claim the moral high ground here?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 We intend to take the arguments up based on fact. Based on the reality of what’s happening  in Australia today. We won’t be hitting below the belt, I don’t think that’s going to be true of  what Labor’s going to do in the campaign if the evidence of the last few weeks is any  indication.   

 QUESTION:   

 Are you confident of your own reelection?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 I never take this seat for granted, I know it’s the most marginal of the four seats in the ACT.  I’ll be out there fighting as hard as I can and I think anyone that’s lived in the ACT in the last 

 12 months will have seen a very active Senator Gary Humphries and will know what kind of  candidate and campaign they can expect from me.   

 QUESTION:  Are you worried about the Greens?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 The Greens always run strong campaigns right at the end of an election period. We don’t see  much of them in the ACT until the election gets near, I’m confident that I can better my  opponent. But I’m going to use strong arguments and my record rather than the fluff that so  often passes as policy from the Greens.   

 QUESTION:   

 How do you think Lin Hatfield Dodds’ measures up against you? Compared to your last  opponent, she’s got a fairly large profile. Do you think she has what it takes to put her over  the line?   

 GARY HUMPHRIES:   

 I actually don’t think this campaign in the Senate will be about Lin Hatfield Dodds or the  personalities, so-much that it will be about the way in which the Greens and Labor have taken  the city for granted. We have a Labor-Greens Government in the Assembly which  I think is  doing extraordinarily bad things for this city and I think that the Greens offer no solutions to  the problems that Canberra and indeed Australia face. So if you believe in the fairies in the  bottom of the garden as the Greens appear to do, you can promise anything, there’s no hard  decisions to be taken, there’s no money that can’t be spent on any issue or problem but the  reality of Government is very different to that. We will have an alternative to the Rudd Labor  Government that will be affordable by Australians and will rely on good management of the  taxpayers dollars. That’s got to be the basis of any sound Government of this country and  we’ll deliver that as we have in the past.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Milligan, one of the feathers in your cap here is that you were a member of the team that  produced the marketing and communications materials for the last ACT election. If that’s a  feather in your cap, you lost a seat through those marketing materials. How good do you  think they were? Why have you chosen to use that as a feather in your cap?   

 JAMES MILLIGAN:   

 Honestly, I think that we did very well in the ACT Legislative Assembly, it came down to the  last few hundred votes. The message that we got out to the ACT community that we’re here  to provide an alternative to the Stanhope Government and that’s what we’ll be doing for this  year’s Federal Election, we’re going to be putting out a message that we are an alternative to  the current Government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Your reaction to the public service?   

 JAMES MILLIGAN:   

 I agree with everything Giulia said. Anyone in the public service now will not lose their jobs.  What will be happening is a 2 year freeze on new employment.
