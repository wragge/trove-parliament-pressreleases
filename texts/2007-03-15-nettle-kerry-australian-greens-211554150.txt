 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Cruel, expensive and unnecessary 'Nauru farce' continues  with Sri Lankans 

 15th Mar 07 

 Australian Greens spokesperson on Immigration, Senator Kerry  Nettle condemned the government's decision to send 83 Sri Lankan  asylum seekers to Nauru as unnecessary and cruel and a huge  waste of taxpayers' money.   

 "By sending these men to Nauru the Government is lending  Australia's backing to the weakening of the international refugee  system," said Senator Nettle.   

 "The Government's ridiculous 'Pacific Solution' not only hurts those  unfortunate asylum seekers caught in its web but also sends a  message to the world that Australia condones the evasion of legal  and moral responsibilities to care for asylum seekers.   

 "The Sri Lankan asylum seekers will now find it extremely difficult to  access legal advice, medical assistance and emotional support.   

 "The Minister should reveal how much the charter flight transfer will  cost the taxpayer and how long these people will be on Nauru?    

 "Is this going to be a repeat of the sad and cruel situation where  refugees were left languishing on Nauru for several years?   

 "The Nauru government has made it clear that they are only willing  to help process people and are not willing to act as a permanent  holding centre.   

 "Prime Minister Howard is still stuck in his outdated political  xenophobic mode whilst most Australians have moved on since the  dark days of Tampa in 2001."
