 SOUTH AFRICAN GRANTED REFUGEE' STATUS

 "A South African national using the name "Pete Smith"  has been granted refugee status in Australia," the Minister  for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, said  today.

 "My decision to grant refugee status to "Smith" followed a  favourable recommendation to me by the Determination of  Refugee Status Committee. "Mr Smith's" application was  carefully assessed in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention  and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees," he said.

 "The decision to grant refugee status was taken in the light  of "Mr Smith's" activities in opposition to apartheid and  the probable consequences of those activities should be  obliged to return to South Africa. The issue of draft  avoidance was only one of a number of factors that were 

 taken into consideration in reaching the decision on  his case," the Minister said.
