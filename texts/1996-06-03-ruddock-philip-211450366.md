 DRAFT GENDER GUIDELINES FOR REFUGEE DECISION MAKERS

 Draft guidelines dealing with gender related claims by asylum seekers are now ready for community  comment the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today.

 "While there have been procedures in place to ensure asylum seekers are treated in a culturally  sensitive manner, there have been no formal guidelines to ensure gender related claims are dealt with  sensitively and consistently," Mr Ruddock said.

 "My Department has already consulted with some key agencies on this matter and has drafted  guidelines to be used by decision-makers both in Australia and overseas."

 "We will now begin a consultation process to ensure the guidelines are appropriate."

 Mr Ruddock announced his commitment to consult on the completion o f the guidelines at the Women  in Migration Conference, organised by the Bureau o f Immigration, Multicultural and Population  Research.

 The Minister also noted that women refugees and asylum seekers may face particular problems in  seeking protection.

 "They may experience persecution differently to men and they do not necessarily have the same  remedies for state protection, nor the same opportunities for flight," M r Ruddock said.

 "The result is that some women asylum seekers have difficulty in having decision makers recognise the  particular forms o f persecution they face. They might also experience difficulties in discussing claims  related to sexual violence or cultural difficulties."

 Once completed, the guidelines will be implemented, along with gender sensitive training for decision  makers.

 "The Government has a commitment to improving the consultation process and this is a very  important area for the community to have an input," M r Ruddock said.
