 Australian aid for Occupied Territories

 Australia will provide $100,000 for the repair and refurbishment  of three maternity units at the Augusta Victoria Hospital in  Jerusalem, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator  Gareth Evans, announced today.

 / 

 The Augusta Victoria is the major hospital for the 900,000 Arabs  living in the West Bank, 360,000 of whom are refugees assisted by  the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian  Refugees (UNRWA). The hospital is funded by UNRWA and the  Lutheran World Service.

 "The hospital plays a vital role in the provision of health services  for the Arabs in the West Bank," Senator Evans said.

 The hospital is being upgraded to modem standards to cope with  heavy demand for its services and to meet Israeli Government  registration standards.

 Senator Evans said that Australia's contribution will be channelled  through the Australian Lutheran World Service.

 Australian emergency assistance for the Occupied Territories  forms part of the Government's overseas aid program  administered by the Australian International Development 

 Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
