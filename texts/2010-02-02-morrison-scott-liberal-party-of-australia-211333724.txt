 CHRISTMAS ISLAND DETENTION CENTRE AT BURSTING POINT WITH 185  MORE ILLEGAL ARRIVALS 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The illegal arrival of another 181 passengers and 4 crew in a boat intercepted last night will bring our detention 

 facilities on Christmas Island to bursting point, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison 

 said today.  

 “Kevin Rudd has created a sea highway to Christmas Island which has become a visa factory for people 

 smugglers. Christmas Island has become a destination rather than a deterrent under the Rudd Government,” Mr 

 Morrison said.  

 “Christmas Island was already operating at unsustainable levels when I left last week. It is now at bursting point, 

 with this latest illegal arrival, thanks to the failed policies of the Rudd Government,” he said.  

 “The interception of the boat carrying 185 people is the ninth illegal boat arrival in just one month this year. This 

 will push Christmas Island to the edge of its current capacity of 1848 people, with more than 1830 people 

 expected to be on the Island, following this latest interception.  

 “Of the 1848 beds available, 200 are in tents, where some people had been living for 28 days when I visited the 

 Island. A further 488 beds are planned in demountable accommodation, but these will not come on stream until at 

 least April.  

 “When I left Christmas Island last Friday there were just over 1556 people in detention, not including the boat 

 carrying 33 passengers that arrived that day and another vessel carrying 51 passengers yet to arrive. The 

 addition of another 185 people on the island will push our facilities to bursting point.  

 “The Parliament has an additional appropriation before it this week for another $34 million for works on the island 

 to cope with the surge in arrivals caused by Labor’s own failed policies.  

 “What the Rudd Government needs to understand is that more bunk beds is not the answer to this problem. They 

 need to implement policies that stop the boats from coming as was achieved by the Coalition when we were last 

 in Government.  

 “In the last six years of the Coalition there were just 18 illegal boat arrivals. We have had that many under The 

 Rudd Labor Government in just the last eight weeks.  

 “The Rudd Government has lost control of our borders. They must face up to their failure and take action,” Mr 

 Morrison said.
