 AUSTRALIAN AID FOR GULF CRISIS REFUGEES

 Australia will contribute an additional $1.5 million to  assisting foreign nationals stranded as a result of the Gulf  Crisis, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator  Gareth Evans, announced today.

 The assistance, in addition to donations of $500,000 already  announced, will be directed to the International Organisation  for Migration ($750,000), UNICEF ($250,000), the Red Cross  ($250,000) and Australian charities contributing to emergency  relief in the area ($250,000).

 Reports estimate that at any one time about 100,000 people.are  caught in the Jordanian border bottle-neck, with new arrivals  taking the place of those repatriated. .  An additional 40,000 

 people in^ Amman are also reported.  as being in difficult  conditions.  .

 The situation facing foreign nationals from South and South  East Asia as well as Egypt is particularly acute.

 "The enormous dimensions of the repatriation and relief effort  are becoming clearer every day," the Minister said. "As the  numbers escalate, it becomes more and more urgent that people  be repatriated quickly, and that emergency supplies be made  available until they can be repatriated."

 Senator Evans said that the Government had looked hard at the  possibility of sending aircraft in response to the emergency  but had concluded that such an option was not cost effective.  To send an RAAF Hercules would involve an additional cost to  budget of about $200,000, excluding the cost of supplies and 

 the inevitable delays expected in the current circumstances.  In addition, the Hercules could only carry about 10. tonnes of  supplies. An RAAF Boeing 707 could carry about 36 tonnes, but  this would cost one and a half times more than the Hercules.

 "Costs aside, another significant consideration is ensuring  that the supplies arriving are appropriate and timely.  Because of Australia's distance, transporting the supplies  takes longer and on arrival,  may no longer match existing  needs," Senator Evans said. -

 "In my estimation, Australia can contribute faster and more  efficiently by providing cash to the agencies already  operating on the ground."

 Senator Evans detailed the breakup of the $1.5 million as  follows:

 COMMONWEA   PARLIAMENTARY L   MJCAH

 .  $750,000 would be allocated to the International 

 Organisation for Migration (IOM), an international agency  assisting with the coordination of repatriation of South  and South East Asian nationals, which had launched a  $US50 million international appeal.  (This is in addition  to the earlier allocation of $250,000 to the IOM 

 announced by the Australian Government last week).

 .  UNICEF, which had launched a $US5 million appeal, would  receive $250,000 to help with the relief needs of women  and children, currently an estimated 25 per cent of the  population in the staging posts.

 .  A further $250,000 would be channelled to the League of  Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies through the 

 Australian Red Cross Society. This would contribute to  the League's relief operations in cooperation with local  authorities and Red Crescent Societies. (This allocation  follows the announcement on 31 August 1990 that the ICRC,  the League's sister organisation, which has a $7 million  appeal currently running, would receive $250,000 for its  emergency activities in the Gulf).

 .  The remaining $250,000 would be allocated to various  other Australian non-government organisations contributing to the emergency relief activities in the  area (presently CARE, Austcare and World Vision).

 Provision for emergency relief assistance forms part of the  Government's overseas aid program administered by the  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau  (AIDAB).

 Senator Evans said that the Government's response was the most  generous possible, given the great strain already imposed by  the Iran and Philippines earthquakes on the Emergency, vote in  the aid budget (for which $8 million had been allocated for  world-wide disaster relief in 1990-91). .
