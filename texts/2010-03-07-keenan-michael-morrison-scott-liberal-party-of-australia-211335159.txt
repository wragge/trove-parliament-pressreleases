 OVER 4000 ILLEGAL ARRIVALS ON LABOR'S WATCH, WITH MORE TO  COME 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and 

 Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today that the latest illegal boat arrival carrying 80 passengers and 3 

 crew, took the total number of arrivals since the Rudd Government rolled back the Coalition’s strong immigration 

 regime to more than 4000.  

 “The latest boat is number 19 for the year, taking the total number of people to have arrived illegally by boat in 

 2010 to more than 1,000. At this rate there will be more than 100 boats arrive illegally this year and more than 

 5,000 people,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “There is no shortage of potential customers for people smugglers under the Rudd Government’s policies,” he 

 said.  

 “Last week the UNHCR revealed there were currently 79,300 refugees and asylum seekers registered in 

 Malaysia, originating from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Iraq and Afghanistan and a further 20,000 estimated to be 

 unregistered.  

 “Malaysia has long been a transit point on the people smugglers highway from the middle east.  

 “While those from Myanmar have traditionally been unable to secure the price demanded by the people 

 smugglers, this has not been the experience of the Sri Lankans, Afghans and Iraqis.  

 “These groups have dominated the passenger manifests of the 87 boats and more than 4000 people that have 

 illegally arrived since Labor rolled back the Coalition’s border protection regime.  

 “Under the Rudd Government people smugglers now have the product that enables them to pursue their trade in 

 an almost inexhaustible market,” he said.  

 Mr Keenan said: “The Government's omission of key details of this latest arrival, including the location and time 

 of interception, are clear signs of panic.  

 "The Government is finally being confronted with the seriousness of their border protection crisis, and in typical 

 fashion is hiding information to avoid public scrutiny.  

 "The Government has been withholding the nationality of passengers for a while now and earlier this week we 

 saw them withhold the location of an interception - now they're withholding the time of the interception.  

 "At this rate the Government will soon stop announcing illegal arrivals altogether,” Mr Keenan said.
