 Minister urges Nauru protestors against self-harm

 VPS 84/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, urged hunger strikers on Nauru to end their hunger strike.

 'Participation in a hunger strike will not help the cause of the individuals concerned,' Senator Vanstone said.

 'I would also encourage any of the advocacy groups in contact with the protestors on Nauru to advise them to end their hunger  strike.

 'Self-harm is not a form of protest that should be encouraged by anyone, nor will such protests impact on the Government's  considerations of claims for refugee status.'

 The Minister confirmed there were now six hunger strikers on Nauru.

 'I'm advised that three Iraqi men commenced a hunger strike on Monday and they were joined by another three men last night,'  Minister Vanstone said.

 'All have been provided with drinking water.

 'IOM, which manages the Offshore Processing Centre is closely monitoring the protestors involved and will provide  counselling and medical assistance as required.

 'The Minister said it was important to remember that all the Iraqis on Nauru had been assessed by both DIMIA and UNHCR  as not being refugees.

 'All the Iraqis on Nauru have been offered voluntary return to Iraq.

 'There have been no forced removals of Iraqis on Nauru, primarily because of the difficulty of undertaking direct returns while  the Coalition Provisional Authority is limiting the number of returns from developed countries.'
