 Minister Announces New Immigration Detention Advisory Group MPS 022/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the formation of the Immigration Detention Advisory Group to provide him with advice on the appropriateness and adequacy of services, accommodation and facilities at immigration detention centres around Australia.

 The Minister explained that the Group would make regular visits to all detention centres, would have unfettered access and would consult with staff and detainees to obtain first-hand information on the operation and environment at each centre.

 The Group will advise the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Kay Patterson, on issues affecting people in immigration detention.

 Chaired by the Hon John Hodges, a former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the group will meet for the first time within the next month or so, and identify priority issues to be addressed over the next year.

 Members of the group include:

 Dr Mohammed Taha Alsalami (NSW) Mr Paris Aristotle (VIC) Air Marshal Ray Funnell (ACT) Major-General Warren Glenny (NSW) Ms Ellen Goodman (NSW) The Hon Gerry Hand (VIC) Prof Harry Minas (VIC)

 "I welcome the input of such a distinguished group, chosen for their individual expertise and commitment to immigration and humanitarian issues," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I am confident Australia's detention program will benefit from their collective experience and wisdom."
