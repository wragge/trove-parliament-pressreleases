  Australia provides $6 million to support displaced Iraqis 

  Australia will provide $6 million to help support Iraqi refugees and internally displaced  persons. 

  Our contribution of $3 million will assist UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, to  reach Iraqi refugees in nearby countries such as Syria and Jordan. 

  Australia will provide $3 million to the International Organization for Migration to assist  Iraqis who have been forced from their homes and are now living in other parts of Iraq. 

  Australia’s contributions will help to provide food, shelter and medical assistance to the most  vulnerable. 

  Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were displaced under the Saddam Hussein regime due to war,  human rights abuses, and the deliberate expulsion of citizens from their homes. The current  security situation in Iraq, due to terrorist and sectarian violence, has further contributed to this  situation. 

  Since 2003 Australia has committed $173 million to help Iraq meet its humanitarian and  reconstruction needs. Australia has previously contributed $6.8 million to the United Nations  and $4 million to IOM in order to support internally displaced people within Iraq.
