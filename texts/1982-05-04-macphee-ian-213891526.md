 MIGRATION PROGRAM FOR 1982/83

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, .  announced today that the Government had decided on the size  of the migration program for 1982/83. .

 Next year between 115 000 and 120 000 people will be selected  for migration to Australia. This includes 24 000 refugees and  excludes New Zealand citizens who are not subject to migrant ' selection procedures.

 "The program in 1982/83 is a reflection of the new migration  policy which commenced operation on 19 April. The new policy  virtually excludes independent applicants where occupations  are not in demand in Australia. At the same time the new policy  gives important concessions to sponsored relatives of Australian 

 residents and citizens"/ the Minister said. -"Over the past -   decade a number of new migrant communities have established  themselves in Australia and they will be able to take advantage  of the family migration concessions as will our more traditional  migrant communities".

 The Minister said that ‘  the Department of .  Immigration and Ethnic .··  Affairs was introducing a new system to improve management of  .  the migration program. "In the past we have managed the -   migration program on the basis, of the number, of migrants, who. . .  .  

 arrive in Australia each financial year. :  -  â   .  ;  - . ·  ~

 "This has proved.to b e .somewhat unwieldly and has led to . decisions on occasions to delay the departure dates of migrants  in order to meet the arrival targets causing some inconvenience  to all concerned.

 "From 1982/83 the program will be set on the basis of the number  of migrants to be approved by my Department each year.

 "This, plus a new computer based management system will mean *   that we will be more efficient in meeting our targets. Statistics  of settler arrivals and migrant approvals will be published". *

 In 1981/82 it is anticipated that about 111 000 selected migrants  and refugees will arrive in Australia. The program for 1982/83  represents an increase-of about 4% on this years intake.

 "New Zealand citizens could migrate to Australia without the  need for visas or migrant processing just as Australian citizens  are free to migrate to New Zealand" Mr Macphee said. "Because  there are no immigration controls on New Zealand citizens it  makes sense to exclude them from the Department's planning 

 target", he said. .

 Statistics of New Zealand settler arrivals, however, will  continue to be published. In 19 81/82.some 12 000 - 14 000  New Zealand arrivals are expected.
