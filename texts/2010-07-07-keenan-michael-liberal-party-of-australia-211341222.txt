 'New boats' announcement a farce   07/07/10  

 The new Gillard Labor Government is clutching at straws by re-announcing, for the  third time, new patrol vessels for Australia’s border protection system on the eve of  an election, according to Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Michael Keenan. 

 Mr Keenan said the Government was pulling out every trick in the book, including re-announcing new boats, in a desperate bid to appear tough on our borders to the voters. 

 “The ‘announcement’ by the new Prime Minister is a complete farce, and smacks of  desperation and of a government clutching at straws on election eve,” Mr Keenan  said. 

 “The ‘eight additional boats’ have actually been due for replacement since 2007. 

 “This Labor Government has been delaying their replacement due to their budget  books being in the red. 

 “This reality is this Government has shown a complete lack of commitment to  resourcing the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service; these “new” boats  are merely the replacement vessels they have so badly needed in order to deal with the  increasing flood of illegal boat arrivals 

 “There will be no additional boats - merely the replacement of an aging existing fleet  that have outlived their operational life span. 

 “The replacement of the Bay Class vessels has been in the Budget papers for the past  few years - this is nothing new. 

 “The Prime Minister needs to stop relying on spin and hollow statements - only real  action by a Coalition government will stop the boats from arriving.”
