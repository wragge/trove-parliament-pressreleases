 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 STATEMENT ON MANUS ISLAND 

 

 Overnight reports of weapons being discharged and rocks being thrown at an offshore  processing centre on Manus Island are concerning and must be fully investigated.    

 The Australian and Papua New Guinea Governments must work together to ensure the  safety of asylum seekers, refugees and staff living or working in Australian-funded  offshore processing centres.    

 There have been conflicting reports about how and why this incident began and the  types of force used by authorities on Manus Island.     

 The culture of secrecy must change.  The Turnbull Government must be upfront about  what has happened overnight on Manus Island.    

 Labor supports a full investigation into how this incident began, who is responsible and  how authorities responded.    

 People who seek asylum have a right to have their claims processed in a safe and  timely way. It appears the Turnbull Government is now failing on both these fronts.
