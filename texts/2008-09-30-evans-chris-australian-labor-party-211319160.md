 Unauthorised boat arrivals intercepted off Ashmore 

 Tuesday 30 September 2008 

 Australia’s strong border protection regime detected and intercepted a vessel  carrying 14 people near Ashmore Islands, 320 kilometres off Australia’s north-west  coast, earlier today.                          

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans said 12  passengers and two crew were on board the vessel when it was intercepted by a  Royal Australian Navy patrol boat, under the control of Border Protection Command. 

 The group of passengers on board consists of 11 men and one woman. Their  nationalities and reasons for travel to Australia are yet to be confirmed. 

 The group will be transferred to Christmas Island for processing. They are expected  to arrive later this week and will be held in detention while they undergo health,  security, identity and other checks to establish their identity and reasons for travelling  to Australia. 

 ‘The interception of this group of unauthorised arrivals clearly demonstrates the  Rudd Government’s border security arrangements are working. We congratulate all  agencies involved in this apprehension,’ Senator Evans said.  

 ‘On coming to Government, Labor maintained extensive patrolling of our borders by  Defence and Customs which is why we were able to intercept this vessel.’  

 Senator Evans said the government’s ongoing commitment to border security was  firm and resolute. 

 ‘Attempting to breach Australia’s borders and the integrity of its immigration system  is a serious matter and the government will continue to take robust measures to  protect Australia’s borders,’ Senator Evans said. 

 Senator Evans said the Australian Government continues to work closely with other  countries in the region to combat people-smuggling. 

 ‘People smuggling is an insidious trade where criminals exploit vulnerable people  whose lives may be put at risk,’ Senator Evans said.
