 Immigration Minister Tables Flood Report MPS 023/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today tabled the report, Inquiry into Immigration Detention Procedures,  prepared by Mr Philip Flood AO.

 "I asked Mr Flood to examine the processes in place for identifying, dealing with, reporting on and following up allegations where there is reasonable suspicion of child abuse in immigration detention centres," the Minister said.

 "I also asked him to report on how well these processes had been followed in cases during the past year and advise on any area where he believed processes need to be improved.

 "Mr Flood examined 35 cases and has concluded that in all but one case, allegations or incidents involving a reasonable suspicion of child abuse were handled in accordance with relevant legislation and departmental procedures.

 "Mr Flood conducted around 100 interviews which included representatives from the Department, Australasian Correctional Management (ACM), Amnesty International, religious organisations, refugee groups, State health authorities and the Ombudsman's office as well as doctors and nurses.

 "While the South Australian Family and Youth Services and the South Australian Police found no evidence to substantiate the highly publicised allegations involving the 12 year old boy late last year Mr Flood found a situation where the processes set down in the legislation and the administrative requirements of the Department and of ACM instructions were not followed.

 "His report presents a very constructive assessment of what can usefully be done to improve management of situations such as this and I endorse the overall thrust of his

 recommendations."

 The Minister explained that of Mr Flood's 16 recommendations, his Department was already acting on or will quickly implement the vast majority. In doing so, some aspects will need further examination by the Department, including resolution of legal contractual issues, and this will be done quickly.

 Currently:

 ACM is revising policy instructions on managing child protection issues. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Training for detention staff is being reviewed. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Negotiation of protocols with State authorities involved with immigration detention is a priority. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Department's management arrangements in the Woomera, Port Hedland and Curtin centres are being strengthened by the appointment of Assistant DIMA Business Managers and attention is being focused on refinements to case management of detainees and performance management of the contract with ACM.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There have been significant improvements at the Woomera centre during the last year and plans for further improvements are well advanced. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There has also been significant re-engineering of protection visa application processing to expedite the process as far as possible. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "I would like to thank Mr Flood for his thorough and balanced examination of many complex issues involved in immigration detention," added the Minister.

 "His efforts will be reflected in improved management of Australia's detention facilities."
