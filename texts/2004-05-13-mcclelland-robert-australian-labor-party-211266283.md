 Vanstone’s statements a disgrace   

 Statements by Amanda Vanstone that the indefinite detention of children  should be used as a law enforcement tool are a national disgrace.   

 People smuggling is a serious crime and one that demands a serious law  enforcement response.    

 This response must include stronger border protection, heightened police  resources and powers, as well as serious jail terms, including life sentences  for the most serious people smugglers.    

 It must also include developing partnerships with law enforcement  agencies in the region, international organisations and the wider  international community.   

 Amanda Vanstone’s suggestion that the detention of children should be  used as a law enforcement tool reveals a Minister who does not  understand the basics of law enforcement or border protection.   

 

 People smuggling is an issue that understandably causes Australians great  concern. To use that justified concern to attack an independent statutory  body entrusted with protecting human rights in Australia is the height of  irresponsibility. 

 

 You do not catch criminals and protect borders by detaining children,  and you do not serve this country’s interest by attacking an independent  statutory body that is integral to our health as a modern democratic  nation. 

 

 Amanda Vanstone’s must acknowledge that her disgraceful comments  were ill-conceived, and should immediately be withdrawn.
