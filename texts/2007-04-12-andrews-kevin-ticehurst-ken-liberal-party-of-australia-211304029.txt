 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 

 Outreach to visit Wyoming 

 Joint Media Release with Ken Ticehurst MP, Member for Dobell 

 Thursday, 12 April 2007 

 Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will be in  Wyoming next week as part of a regional outreach visit. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach  trips are a great way for people in regional areas to sit down and talk about  immigration-related issues face-to-face with DIAC officers. 

 ‘The Australian Government places great importance on providing services to  regional areas and these visits are a large part of that,’ Mr Andrews said. 

 ‘These visits attract a range of people, from farmers to small business owners,  community groups to individuals, who might want information or just someone  to talk them through a complex matter. 

 ‘While the Department has a great deal of information available over the  phone or on the internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face,  and these visits are about meeting that need,’ he said.  

 ‘In the past, the most popular topics relate to citizenship, work visas, visas for  family members and how to propose and sponsor refugees.’ 

 DIAC officers will be available for an appointment on Monday April 30 from  9.30am. 

 Appointments will be held at the Wyoming Community Centre, 147 Maidens  Brush Road, Wyoming. Bookings are essential.  Telephone: 4323 7483
