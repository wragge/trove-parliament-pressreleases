 Howard On East Timor Laurie Brereton - Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 Media Statement - 13 September 2000

 John Howard's assertion that Australia's response to last year's East Timor crisis would have been 'totally different' under a Labor Government is a completely misleading and partisan remark", the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, said today.

 "Mr Howard's view of events is highly selective and completely self-serving."

 "For the record, Labor took the lead in changing policy to support East Timorese self-determination. We did so in 1997 and confirmed the change at our National Conference in February 1998. Notwithstanding the fall of the Suharto regime, Foreign Minister Downer declined to support East Timorese self-determination in the 1998 election campaign."

 "Labor first advocated the deployment of international observers in East Timor in October 1998. The Howard Government refused to support this proposal."

 "In December 1998, John Howard wrote to President Habibie advocating a policy approach involving a long period of autonomy and designed to maximise the prospects for East Timor remaining part of Indonesia. In January 1999, Habibie rejected Mr Howard's advice and put East Timor on the fast-track to self-determination."

 "At the beginning of February 1999, Labor urged the Howard Government to press Indonesia to accept international peacekeepers in East Timor. Labor repeatedly warned that the Indonesian military were deeply implicated in pro-Indonesia militia violence. The Government rejected Labor's approach and argued that peacekeeping was unnecessary, premature and likely to be counterproductive. As a consequence no international pressure was placed on Indonesia to accept UN peacekeepers."

 "Foreign Minister Downer repeatedly claimed the militias were aided only by a few 'rogue elements' within the Indonesian military-- yet all the while secret Australian intelligence assessments confirmed the involvement of the highest levels of the TNI chain of command."

 "Right up to the 30 August 1999 ballot, the Howard Government argued that peacekeepers were unnecessary and that unarmed civilian police were sufficient to protect the United Nations mission in East Timor."

 "As a consequence of this profound policy failure, the East Timorese went to the polls with no protection. Hundreds if not thousands were killed in the post-ballot violence. East Timor's towns and villages were torched. The country's infrastructure was comprehensively destroyed. A year later, more than 100,000 remain in refugee camps in West Timor, in dire circumstances and subject to militia intimidation and violence."

 "It is a matter of enduring regret that the Howard Government failed to heed Labor's warnings.
