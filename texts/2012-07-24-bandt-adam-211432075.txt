 Adam Bandt MP  Acting Leader, Australian Greens  Federal Member for Melbourne   

 24 July 2012   

 Melbourne Galaxy poll backs Greens on refugees   

 Greens Acting Leader Adam Bandt has released polling of the Federal electorate of  Melbourne showing strong support for the Greens’ stance on refugee policy.   

 The poll shows people in Melbourne do not want the Greens to vote for the government’s  Malaysia people swap policy and want Parliamentarians to work on a different solution. The  Coalition’s policy of sending people to Nauru was also rejected. Fifty-eight percent of the  electorate supported a post-Vietnam war style regional solution, as advocated by the  Greens.   

 Over 80% of people supported helping refugees by bringing them to Australia and rejected  sending them “offshore”. A majority of voters also said that Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard  had the same policy on refugees and that they were playing to racism and xenophobia by  sending refugees offshore.   

 “Across the political spectrum, there is clearly very strong support in my electorate for the  Greens stance on refugees,” Mr Bandt said.   

 “As I continue to work towards a cross-party solution in meetings today, it is great to know  that the Greens approach has the backing of my electorate.”   

 “People want to see politicians working together and they like the post-Vietnam War style  solution that the Greens have put on the table.”   

 “It is also clear that my electorate strongly supports the stance we have taken in opposing  Labor’s Malaysia solution and Tony Abott’s plan to reopen Nauru.”   

 “We will continue to work for a New Regional Plan of Action that will save lives and uphold  international law.”   

 The Greens have outlined a New Regional Plan of Action in a submission to the Expert Panel.  It includes processing and taking more refugees from camps in places like Indonesia and  Malaysia, removing the incentive for people to get on boats. It is similar to the plan adopted  by Malcolm Fraser in the years after the Vietnam War.

 Melbourne Poll 

 Methodology 

 ï´â¯This is the second poll to be administered in the federal electorate of Melbourne. 

 ï´â¯The initial poll was administered in September 2011 and this latest poll was conducted between Friday 13 July 

 and Monday 16 July, 2012.  

 ï´â¯The sample comprises 400 voters, distributed throughout the electorate.  Quotas based on age, gender and 

 postcode were applied to ensure that the sample composition reflects the population.  

 ï´â¯Interviews were conducted using CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing) with telephone numbers 

 randomly selected from the electronic White Pages.  All interviewers were personally trained and briefed on the 

 requirements of the study. 

 ï´â¯Following the completion of interviewing, the data was weighted by postcode, age and gender to reflect the 

 latest ABS population estimates.
