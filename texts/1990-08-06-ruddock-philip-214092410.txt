 ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION - ALARMING STATISTICS 6th August 1990

 The weekend annoucement that illegal entrants in Australia at  April last had increased by 50% to 90,000 is alarming enough.

 However, when considered with other categories illegal entry has  reached outrageous proportions.

 30.000 people who have applied for grant-of-residence status have  not been included as they have temporary entry while being  processed. (These numbers are of record proportions).

 20.000 PRC Students in Australia at 20th June 1989 have in the  main not been included as they have temporary entry.

 Other possible intending overstayers including 25,000 PRC  Nationals who entered Australia in December/January last should  have valid student or visitor visas.

 Thus, possible illegal immigrants could approach a figure of  160.000 rather than 90,000 status.

 These figures demonstrate that regardless of what is said about  200 or so boat people, Labor has lost control of entry  arrangements for Australia.

 It is a result not only of bungled changes in migration law and  regulations, but an absence of application of appropriate  resources for compliance activity.

 In recent years on average.no more than 2 officers per  Immigration Regional Office have been charged with compliance  work.

 fc

 Iven the annoucement of trebling compliance staff appears to be  ‘ittle more than a re-annoucement of last year's statement by  £2 0i  enator Ray following the claimed crackdown on lax student entry  > O: ules.  Then new fees were imposed on students to enhance  ^ ^compliance activity.

 gj 2 However, there must be realistic application of resources to the  to compliance task and a simple re-annoucement of earlier decisions  tin computer acguisition and the like will certainly not suffice.
