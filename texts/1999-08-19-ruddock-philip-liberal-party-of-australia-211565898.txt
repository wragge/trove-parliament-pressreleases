  Media Release

  The Hon Philip Ruddock, MP

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

  

  MPS 118/99

  Over 100 
Chinese Boat People Removed

  Australia today returned a 
group of 101 Chinese boat people to Fujian Province, in what is one 
of the largest rem  ovals ever conducted, the Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

  Making the announcement, Mr Ruddock said that in 
the past, the largest removal had been a group of 136 to China. He said 
that in sending such a large group home, he hoped it would show others 
from the Province that such journeys were pointless. 

  "The group of 101 returned today is made up 
of illegal boat people who arrived in late May and early June," 
said the Minister. "Those involved were to pay organisers up to 
$36,000 to travel to Australia," said the Minister, "with 
up to $10,000 paid up front the remainder to be paid by their family 
in China on their arrival in Australia. 

  "I hope that the very public return of the group 
will send a strong message to others that they shouldn't believe the 
lies peddled by people traffickers, and that Australia is not a soft 
touch when it comes to illegal boat people. 

  "The return also shows the level of support 
and respect that exists between the Australian and Chinese governments, 
and China's determination to deter the dangerous and futile trade in 
people smuggling," said the Minister. 

  Mr Ruddock said a press statement had been released 
in China announcing the return of the group. He said it clearly spelt 
out to potential passengers that people who tried to enter Australia 
illegally would be detained, and that if they had no right to stay, 
would be sent back. 

  In addition, the Minister said his department was 
also introducing recommendations recently made by the Prime Minister's 
Coastal Surveillance Task Force. He said these included boosting the 
Department's presence at seven overseas posts and five key airports, 
as well as work closely with countries such as Indonesia and Papua New 
Guinea, to help them detect and detain traffickers.
