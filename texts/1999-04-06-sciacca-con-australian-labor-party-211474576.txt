  ALP CALLS FOR GREATER ASSISTANCE

  TO KOSOVO REFUGEES

  

  Shadow Minister for Imm igration, Con Sciacca, said today that 
the Government’s efforts to assist the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
did not go far enough.

  

 Mr Sciacca said that, while the Federal Opposition 
supported the Government stance in not providing temporary resettlement 
to large numbers of refugees, the Government had to be far more generous 
with its aid package, and keep an open and flexible mind to future developments 
in Kosovo.

  

 “This is one of the largest humanitarian crises 
since the end of World War 2. We must be flexible in terms of permanent 
refugee settlements and be more generous with our financial aid package,” 
Mr Sciacca said.

  

 “There are estimated to be up to 750,000 displaced 
people from Kosovo to date. The Government's sole contribution of $2 
million represents a mere $2.66 per person.

  

 “Surely we can do better,” Mr Sciacca said.

  

 Mr Sciacca said that the 4500 places for Balkan refugees 
allocated by the Immigration Department, as part of the Government’s 
normal refugee program of 10,000, would not benefit the current wave 
of displaced people, as these places were already earmarked for refugees 
displaced earlier.

  

 “The Government should consider boosting the permanent 
humanitarian intake or borrowing from next year’s program to offset 
this crisis - particularly in response to a formal request from UNHCR, 
should this be forthcoming.

  

 “This measure was taken by the former Labor Government 
in response to the

 in 1995-96,” Mr   
said.

  

 Mr Sciacca said that the Federal Opposition would 
offer bipartisan support if the G Government took action this front.

  

 The United Nations High Commission for Refugees and 
the Refugee Council of Australia support an expanded financial Package 
from the Federal Government.

  

 ENDS.
