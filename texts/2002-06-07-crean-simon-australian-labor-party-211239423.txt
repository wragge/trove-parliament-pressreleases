 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 7TH JUNE 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Dr Wooldridge unauthorised email account; asylum seekers;                 sale of Telstra; 50:50 rule

 CREAN: These latest revelations about Dr Wooldridge are outrageous.  Where does this bloke stop?  I mean, we have got now evidence that two days after he finished as a Minister he took up as a consultant for the health industry and continued to access government information.  On the face of it he could be in the breach of the law.  It seems he has overrode the Minister and he continues to use government resources for what could be private gain.

 The Prime Minister must commission yet another inquiry into Dr Wooldridge to ascertain just what has gone on here.  It’s totally inappropriate for a Minister resigned, taking up in the private sector and accessing government information.  His explanation this morning, totally inadequate.

 JOURNALIST: Kay Patterson is doing her own inquiry, is that good enough?

 CREAN: No it’s not.  The Prime Minister must commission a full inquiry.  Kay Patterson doing an inquiry?  He overrode Kay Patterson.  I mean, who is the Minister here?  It is like we have got Banquo at the Cabinet table with Dr Wooldridge.

 JOURNALIST: It seems though that the Health Minister did act quickly when she realised what was going on.

 CREAN: She acted but he overrode her.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 CREAN: Well, this is what the investigation has to establish.  What sort of a government is it where the Minister of the day is being ignored and

 2

 being overridden by the former Minister?  I mean, this is not how you run government.  This demands a full comprehensive inquiry.  Yet another inquiry into Dr Wooldridge.  This guy can’t help himself.

 JOURNALIST: If as it seems that it is a loyal former employee of Dr Wooldridge there is not much the government can do to stop a loyal former staff member doing what he thinks, or what she thinks is the right thing to do?

 CREAN: The Government has to do it.  A government has to demonstrate that there is no conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.  What we have here are these simple facts.  Former Minister turned consultant for the health industry accessing all his departmental records.  He can go back to every Cabinet submission over the last six years.  Don’t you think that information could be relevant for him feathering his nest?

 And you have also got the circumstance, I understand, where he actually demanded to be given an office in the department.  A physical office.  So he is not only accessing the electronic office he wants a physical office as well. He thinks he is still the Minister.  Banquo at the Cabinet table.

 JOURNALIST: What sort of inquiry do you want?

 CREAN: A full comprehensive inquiry by the Prime Minister to establish what was accessed and how appropriate that information was.  And how it is that a ministerial direction to take Dr Wooldridge off the listing is ignored and overridden by one of the staffers.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 CREAN: We can’t be convinced of that.  We’ve heard him deny things in the past only to be proven incorrect.  You can’t believe what he has had to say.  And we need to establish whether he has accessed information that he has been able to use for commercial gain.  But even if he hasn’t used it for commercial gain it’s the appearance of conflict of interest that has to be stopped.  It is totally inappropriate under the Westminster system of government.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, anyone who is a Cabinet Minister, Mr Reith, Dr Wooldridge and those people in the Labor Party they are going to have an advantage anyway over …  Should there be a cooling off period maybe?

 CREAN: Yes there should, and that is what I’ve called for.  A 12 month cooling off period that prevents ministers taking up jobs in areas in which they have had immediate responsibility.  And I’ve called for that on previous occasions, it’s now appropriate for the Prime Minister to adopt that principle.  We have seen too much in terms of the Peter Reith and Michael

 Wooldridge episode for people to be dissatisfied with the way in which people, ministers, former ministers can use to advantage information they have while they are a minister.

 JOURNALIST: What about diplomatic appointments?  Should the cooling off period apply to those as well?

 CREAN: I believe that the 12 month period should be the benchmark in relation to all former ministers.  That’s what I have called for.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 CREAN: I’ve also said, though, that if that person can demonstrate that taking up a position does not involve conflict of interest, or that appearance of conflict of interest they should be able to make that case to an independent person.  It’s the reversal of the onus.  At the moment the individual simply says, this is the minister, I’m taking the job and there is no check against him.  If they reckon they have got a case and can prove that there is no conflict of interest they should be able to make that case and have it determined independently.

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Mr Ruddock that continual visits by bodies like the UN is encouraging detainees to self hurt themselves essentially?

 CREAN: No I don’t.  And in my call for the kids to be taken out

 from behind the razor wire and the mothballing of Woomera I also said that there should be improved access to independent assessment as to how the detention facilities are being run.

 I also believe it’s appropriate for those facilities to be returned and be run by Australian Protective Services so there is accountability for the government. These are all reforms that I believe are absolutely necessary.

 Now, of course, approval has to be obtained to make the investigations but I think it is entirely appropriate that we get some independent assessment because we have too much Government deceit and misleading about what’s going on in the facilities.

 JOURNALIST: This team has also expressed concern over the detention of pregnant women and the elderly.  Are there other groups that should be released?

 CREAN: Well, I’ve called for the kids and their mothers to be outside the razor wire.  I just don’t think it is an appropriate environment for them.

 JOURNALIST: Pregnant women and the elderly?

 CREAN: Well, I haven’t considered that position.  I believe that the call appropriately is kids and mums.  I will have a look at the report that has been made and if appropriate I will respond in due course.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, what do you think about this idea of the Government buying domestic shares and foreign assets to keep the country’s bond market alive?

 CREAN: This is the problem gambler returned to the casino.  This is Peter Costello now telling us that he wants to sell Telstra so that he can gamble on the share market.  This from a Treasurer that has already lost $5 billion in currency swaps.  What we have got at the Cabinet table is not just Banquo but Banko as well now.  And he wants to extend his role.

 I mean, here we have a Treasurer not so long ago telling us that all of Telstra was being sold to retire debt but his Treasury officials are now contradicting him and giving him the licence to return to the gambling table in circumstances in which they have lost $5 billion of Australian punters money already.

 JOURNALIST: …bond market wound down…?

 CREAN: I think that there is a legitimate concern that is being raised about the need to keep liquidity in the bond market with a government presence.  But there are other alternatives that have been considered as I understand by Government on that and I call on the Government, and those officials that talked of this last night at the Senate Estimates, to come forward and give a detailed report on those options.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, what’s you opinion on the fact that DFAT is allowing China to roll out something like 23 IT sections in DFAT overseas embassies?

 CREAN: That’s the first I’ve heard of it.  I can’t comment on that.

 JOURNALIST: What’s your opinion on Bill Shorten from the AWU falling in behind 50:50?

 CREAN: Well, I welcome the recognition by a key union in this country but it’s important to move forward in this debate.  It is important to recognise that the relationship with the trade union movement is about agendas and not proportions and I welcome the fact that the union is in support of my proposal to modernise our relationship with the trade union movement.

 JOURNALIST: He is from Victoria, he is from the Right, is this the first swallow of summer or is there a long way to go yet?

 CREAN: No, I think that we are making important progress in this debate.  Bear in mind that whilst he is from Victoria he is the National Secretary of the union and it has support from other sections of his union.

 But I think it’s a welcome development and I hope that others consider the debate in the context of what I had to say in full at the Brisbane conference, the agenda being developed with the trade union movement on key issues such as the living wage, on maternity leave, on protection of worker entitlements, on our opposition to unfair dismissal laws.

 There are important issues to advance the interests of working people.  It’s that agenda and that relationship with the trade union movement that is going to matter because they are the real issues of concern to working people.  It is that agenda I want to develop with the trade union movement but we as a Party have to reach out to a wider audience than just the trade union movement.  And we can only do that, we can only draw them in if we are offering them an equal say in the Party.  Not a minority say.

 That’s what the 50:50 relationship is about.  A relationship with the trade union movement, but a relationship with a wider audience as well to lift our primary vote.

 JOURNALIST: You have got 11 months and three weeks to go according to George Campbell’s calendar.  How is it all going, very well?

 CREAN: George tells me he was completely misrepresented in terms of those comments and, go back and ask him if you doubt that.  I’ve got two and a half years until the next election…

 JOURNALIST: It’s been a tough week.

 CREAN: And my intention is to win that next election.  The path to reform and the path to modernisation is difficult.  It does upset people in the process but I am not going to be deterred.  We will not win unless we reform and modernise.  I am committed to that task and I am delighted that I’m finding people now prepared to come out openly and support that directional change.

 Ends.
