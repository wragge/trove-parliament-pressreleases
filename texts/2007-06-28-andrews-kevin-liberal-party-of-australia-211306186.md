 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Western Bulldogs greet 51 new citizens 

 Thursday, 28 June 2007 

 AFL club the Western Bulldogs today continued its association with  Melbourne’s refugee community by staging its third annual citizenship  ceremony for people who arrived under Australia’s humanitarian programme. 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Kevin Andrews, attended the club’s  citizenship ceremony with Bulldogs players Mitch Hahn, and Daniel Cross, at  the MCG where 51 people from 14 countries, including Afghanistan, Burma,  Burundi, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Tanzania,  Thailand, Uganda, and Zimbabwe became Australians. 

 When you become a member of your local football club you commit your  loyalty, you gain benefits of membership, and you seek to contribute to the  success of the club. 

 So to by becoming an Australian Citizen you are committing your loyalty to  Australia, you gain all the benefits that Citizenship of Australia brings, and you  seek to make this great nation even greater.  

 As Australians we welcome all people who come and settle in Australia. We  want everyone to participate in the social and economic life of our country and  make our future even brighter.  

 By becoming an Australian Citizen you are committing to Australia's way of  life, you share our values and deserve full membership of our nation.  

 I encourage you to encourage others who have settled here to embrace our  nation, our way of life and commit as you have today to Australia by becoming  an Australian Citizen.
