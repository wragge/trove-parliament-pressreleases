 23 August 2004 Press Release  Number:  04/787

 

 Forum On Indigenous People And Refugees In  Australia 

 

 

 Senator Aden Ridgeway will highlight the Howard Governments retreat from human  rights at a free public forum in St Marys tonight.   

 He will be joined by Big Brother contestant and refugee activist Merlin Luck, Iranian  refugee Fashid Kerohallpour and Phil Glendenning, National President of Australians  for Native Title and Reconciliation.   

 Senator Ridgeway said that while an event like this may have emerged as a result of  the desperate political days in which we now live, it is also an event which has  emerged out of a spirit of unity and of action.    

 "These forums are about bringing people together and about forging links to make us  stronger," said Senator Ridgeway.   

 "The Howard Government is in a high speed retreat from human rights on a road  paved with fear and division and Indigenous Australians, refugees and asylum seekers  are the casualties.   

 "We need to roll out the speed humps and the road blocks and get the Government on  to the road of compassion and justice."   

 The speakers come from political, advocacy, activist and refugee backgrounds and  will provide the audience with the latest information on these important issues.   

 The free public forum is on tonight at St Marys Memorial Hall, Cnr Mamre Rd and  Great Western Highway, ST Marys.
