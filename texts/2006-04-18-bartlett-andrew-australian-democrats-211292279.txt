 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA                          TUESDAY 18 APRIL 2006 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS DEPUTY LEADER 

 VISIT NAURU BEFORE SENDING OTHERS THERE: BARTLETT  Queensland Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett says Liberal Party Senators should visit places like Nauru  before exiling refugees, including children, to such a place.   

 “It is negligent for federal politicians to pass laws that will lock up asylum-seekers in a foreign country when  these MPs have no idea of the conditions they will be subjecting them to,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The current Immigration Minister, Senator Vanstone, has not bothered to go to Nauru even once, despite  being Minister now for over two and a half years.  She even refused to provide support for the Parliament’s  Migration Committee to go there, saying it was outside the Committee’s terms of reference.”   

 The longest-serving member of the Migration Committee, Senator Bartlett is the only federal MP to have  visited Nauru since 2001, having gone three times to inspect the camps and other local facilities, as well as  meet detainees, the people running the camps and local Nauruans.  He has also visited Christmas Island twice  in that time.   

 “Nauru is a nation in dire straits that needs direct, sustainable assistance.  Instead, massive amounts of money  have gone into running the camps, with most of those funds not assisting Nauru in any sustainable way.”   

 “The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which ran the camps on Nauru, has received an  extraordinary $150 million from the Australian taxpayer over the past three years, with $120 million of that  being for the offshore processing centres.”   

 “The Government cannot make their planned changes to the treatment of refugees without passing new laws  through the Senate.”   

 “Senators should not pass laws without having a proper understanding of what conditions they will be forcing  people into and how many millions of extra dollars it is likely to cost the taxpayer.”
