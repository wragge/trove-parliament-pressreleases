 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

 THE WILKIE BETRAYAL, JUST ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE 

 One year ago today Julia Gillard betrayed Andrew Wilkie and tore up a signed agreement;  about  as  solemn  a  document  as  can  be  arrived  at  in  our  Parliament.  And  with  that,  Julia   Gillard  won  a  betrayal  trifecta;  the  Kevin  Rudd  betrayal,  the  Carbon  Tax  betrayal,  and  the   Andrew Wilkie betrayal.  

 Julia  Gillard’s  approach  to  gambling  reform  has  been  purely  political.  Labor’s  policy   approach is not designed to deliver good public policy, it is designed to ensure Julia Gillard  can keep the keys to The Lodge. Decisions which have such significant implications should  be the result of detailed and careful consideration-not backroom deals between a candidate  for the Prime Ministership and a single independent Member of Parliament.  

 The Coalition acknowledges that gambling is a major problem for some Australians and we  support measures that will effectively tackle problem gambling and help address and prevent  gambling addiction. 

 However, the Coalition also understands that most Australians gamble responsibly and that  many  Australians  also  rely  on  the  sector  for  jobs.  Tackling  problem  gambling  requires  a   measured  response  that  doesn’t  just  look  at  poker  machines,  but  tackles  the  underlying   problem of gambling addiction. 

 The  Wilkie  betrayal  isn’t  an  isolated  broken  promise.  In  fact,  today,  I  thought  I’d  take  the   opportunity to remind Australians of a few of Labor’s other broken promises since the 2010  election:  

 1.  Carbon  Tax  

 2. Budget surplus in 2012-13 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 3. A Community Consensus on Taxing Carbon

 4. Cutting company tax 

 5. Massive Defence cuts

 6. Providing monthly updates to parliament on MRRT revenue collection

 7. $500 standard deduction on tax returns

 8. Cuts to foreign aid

 9. 50% discount on interest incomes

 10. Sparing the public service from Budget cuts

 11. Means testing the private health insurance rebate

 12. Consulting Clubs on Gambling Reforms

 13. New era of openness and transparency
