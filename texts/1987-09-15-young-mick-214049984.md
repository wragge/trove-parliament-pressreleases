 1987-88 IMMIGRATION PROGRAM ,

 Budget allocations to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will ensure the entry  to Australia of 120 000 new migrants in 1987-88.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and  Ethnic Affairs, Mick Young, said tonight this represented  a modest increase of 5000 over last year's immigration  target. â 

 "As I announced in June this year, 1987-88 will oe a year  of consolidation for Australia's immigration program which  has benefited from rapid growth in the past two years," he  said.

 "The Government supports an expansive program. However  the most appropriate and responsible strategy at present  is to plan for steady moderate annual increases in line  with the Government's capacity to assist migrants 

 integrate into Australian society.

 "The program therefore, will continue to place a sharper  focus on the economic benefits of migration while at the  same time maintaining its commitment to social and  humanitarian needs."

 Mr Young said the Government's policy would be re-examined  in detail in the forthcoming scrutiny of Australia's  immigration policies. .

 The attached table shows the composition of the 1987-88  immigration program and a comparison with the provisional  immigration figures for 1986-87.
