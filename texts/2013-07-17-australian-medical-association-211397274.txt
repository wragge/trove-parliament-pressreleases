 AMA RELEASES HEALTH POLICY PLATFORM  KEY HEALTH ISSUES FOR THE 2013 FEDERAL ELECTION   

 The AMA today released Key Health Issues for the 2013 Federal Election  - a summary of the major  health issues that the AMA considers must be addressed by the major parties during the election  campaign and into the next term of Government, whichever party wins.   

 Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra, AMA President, Dr Steve Hambleton, said that the  AMA’s health policies are practical, achievable, and affordable.   

 “Health reform must be resuscitated urgently or Australians will find it more and more difficult to get  access to quality affordable health care - where and when they need it,” Dr Hambleton said.   

 “These are tough economic conditions nationally and internationally, but the next Government must  invest the best it can in the health of the Australian people.   

 “It is important in this environment to get back to basics.  We must protect and support the  fundamentals of the health system.     

 “If new funding is limited, then it must go towards building on the things that work, the things that  respond to our changing needs.   

 “Any policy must be tested against the reasons we need reform - our increasing burden of chronic  disease and our ageing population.    

 “Proposals should be moving us toward a joined-up, strengthened primary health care system built on  team-based solutions,” Dr Hambleton said.   

 Key Health Issues for the 2013 Federal Election  covers:   

 â¢ Healthier Australian Families;  â¢ Affordable Medical Services;  â¢ Better Environmental Health;  â¢ Self-Education Expense Cap;  â¢ Medical Workforce and Training;  â¢ Continuing to Improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health;  â¢ Preventing the Harms of Alcohol to Young Australians;  â¢ Medical Care for Dementia, Palliative, and Aged Care Patients;  â¢ Tackling Chronic Disease;  â¢ GP Infrastructure;  â¢ Rural Health; 

 â¢ e-Health; 

 â¢ PBS Authority Prescriptions; and  â¢ Appropriate Health Care for Asylum Seekers.
