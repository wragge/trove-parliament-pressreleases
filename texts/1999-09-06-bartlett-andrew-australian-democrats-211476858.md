  MEDIA RELEASE

  Senator Andrew Bartlett

  Australian Democrats Immigration Spokesperson

  

 6 SEPTEMBER 1999

  Prepare for East Timorese refugees

  

  The Democrats have urged the Government to prepare to give haven to 
East Timorese refugees.

  

  “Australia has  historic and humanitarian obligations to assist 
East Timorese refugees and we should allow for an expansion of the refugee 
program to respond to this situation,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, 
the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

  

 “An influx of East Timorese refugees should not 
mean a reduction in Australia’s existing humanitarian and refugee 
program. This assistance should be “in addition to” - “not instead 
of”.

  

 “Following Australia’s assistance to the Kosovo 
refugees, we already have infrastructure for another temporary safe 
haven program,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

 “The temporary safe haven visa is not ideal as it 
enshrines the legal right of the Government to send refugees back when 
it chooses. Further, refugees are not allowed to apply for permanent 
residency from within Australia. They have to leave Australia before 
they can apply.

  

 “However, given that the visa category exists, we 
should be prepared to use it at short notice,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

 For further information contact Senator Andrew Bartlett 
on 0418 743 789

 or Daele Healy on (07) 3252 7101

  

 (Senator Bartlett will be on a plane until 5.30pm 
EST)
