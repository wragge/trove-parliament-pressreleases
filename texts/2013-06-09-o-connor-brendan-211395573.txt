 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Sunday, 9 June 2013   

 New detention facilities for family groups   

 Families will be accommodated in a new Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) in Darwin, the  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced today.   

 The APOD, adjacent to Wickham Point Immigration Detention Centre, will accommodate irregular  maritime arrivals (IMAs) in family groups.   

 The site at Blaydin Point will be scaled up progressively with the first client transfers occurring within  four weeks of signing the lease.   

 “The Government will ensure that appropriate support services are available to meet the needs of  families,” Mr O’Connor said.   

 “This includes appropriate features such as health and education services.   

 “Irregular maritime arrivals are placed in held detention until the necessary health, security and  identity checks are completed and they can be placed in community detention or into the  community on a bridging visa.   

 “The stay in a detention centre for families will be for the shortest possible time and only while their  mandatory check are undertaken.   

 “If they are found to be refugees, they will be granted a visa to remain in Australia. If they are not,  they will be expected to depart Australia.”
