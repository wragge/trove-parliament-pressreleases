 Turn Ship Decision Around - Brown

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has called on Prime Minister Howard to turn around his decision to ban the Norwegian ship, carrying refugees, from Australian ports.

 “Over 400 desperate people are being made a problem for Indonesia and Norway rather than Australia. I am very concerned by the precedent.

 “In future, asylum seekers are likely to refuse to leave sinking ships rather than face being sent back. This hardline edict will not deter people, but it may well lead to maritime tragedy in the near future.

 “Indonesia will see this as Australia passing the buck.

 “If the refugees go to Norway the message to all Europe is that the Australian Government is selfish, unfair and harsh,” Senator Brown said.
