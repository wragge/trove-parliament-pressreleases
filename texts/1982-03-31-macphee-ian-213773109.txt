 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. THE HON IAN MACPHEE,  M.P.

 SETTLEMENT EXPEDIENCES OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEES

 A report released today provides a human and realistic  insight into the settlement experiences of Indochinese refugees,  

 as seen through their own eyes.

 "The report,  entitled 'Please Listen to What I'm Not Saying',·  is a refreshing document," said the Minister for Immigration and 

 Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee. "Because it highlights .the 

 refugees' own perceptions of their settlement, it encourages 

 an understanding of their problems."

 The report is based on a survey conducted by the Department 

 over the period 1978 to 1980. The title refers to the confusion 

 and breakdown in communication caused when the values and behaviour 

 of one group is misunderstood by another group using other values 

 and behaving differently.  ’  ·

 The refugees had to adjust to a new, Western system, lacking 

 their traditional support systems or an established ethnic  community.  Their problems were exacerbated by Western methods ·  =  

 of providing assistance, which.were completely different from their  own.

 The significant factors that have emerged from the survey are 

 'that the refugees tend to be self-reliant within an extended  family and hierarchical group,  and that they exercise high levels 

 of politeness and prudence,  at least in dealings with authority.

 "The report is published in an effort to encourage greater 

 community involvement in the settlement of Indochinese refugees," 

 said Mr Macphee. "As such it will be of benefit to the general  community and especially those who are already actively involved 

 in the settlement process." â
