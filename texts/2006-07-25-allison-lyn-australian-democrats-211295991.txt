 Australian Democrats Press Releases

 No photo signs in Southbank a sign of fear

 

 The banning of photography in the Melbourne Southbank precinct is a twisted example of bureaucratise  gone mad over the Howard Governments anti-terrorist and anti-immigration campaign the Democrats  said today.   

 The Southbank management has obviously taken the anti-terrorism laws to heart and perhaps  restaurant patrons will soon be eating with plastic knifes and forks, said Democrats leader Senator Lyn  Allison.   

 Southbank is one of Melbournes prime tourist destinations. Tourists probably wont see designs of our  latest warships or planes hanging in the malls.   

 The Treasurers claim that boosting immigration will lead to social division and violence is itself divisive -  a pattern of the Howard-Costello agenda of generating fear.   

 For 10 years the Howard Government has denied our excellent international reputation for the  successful settlement of new migrants and refugees.   

 The Treasurers recent exhortation to Australian women to procreate, is reminiscent of the populate or  perish rhetoric of a by gone era.   

 Signs that say Australians and tourists cant take photos of a shopping and service centre for fear of  unknown terrorist plans is straight out of Orwells 1984.   

 In order to prevent community disharmony and prevent future events like the Cronulla incident, we need  to look at issues which go to the root of the problem.   

 Without appropriate settlement services, migrants are alienated from the wider community and then the  wider community believes that they aren't making the effort to fit in. In order to maintain a harmonious  and diverse society we must ensure that we look after our newest citizens, Senator Allison said.
