 Another 313 Refugee and Humanitarian Arrivals 

 15 September 2006 

 Australia will again welcome 313 refugee and humanitarian entrants in the next week, with  many of those among the most in need of resettlement. 

 “Of these arrivals, 245 are refugees, many of whom have been waiting in refugee camps, in  some cases for years,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone,  said. 

 Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of  resettlement. 

 The remaining 68 people are Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They have been  forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They  also have family or other links with Australia. 

 Of the 313 arrivals, 172 are from Africa, 119 are from the Middle East and South West Asia,  and 22 are from South East Asia. 

 These are all entrants under Australia's refugee and humanitarian programme which  provides 13 000 places each year. 

 “Australia is able to offer protection to so many people, in part, because of our commitment  to maintaining tough border security,” Senator Vanstone said. 

 “There are 12 family groups amongst the arrivals (a total of 55 people), who have been  granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk. These are women who have  lost male family members and are therefore particularly vulnerable.” 

 The refugee and humanitarian entrants will settle across Australia as follows:
