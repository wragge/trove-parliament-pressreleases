  Migrants and refugees to learn   
about Australian citizenship

  

  MPS 22/99 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicu ltural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, today announced the development of a new kit to teach migrants 
and refugees about Australian citizenship. 

 Speaking at the closing 
ceremony of the international English language conference "The 
AMEP: 50 Years of Nation Building" in Melbourne, Mr Ruddock said 
the initiative was part of a year of celebrations to commemorate the 
50th anniversary of Australian citizenship. 

 "This year of celebrations 
aims to bring all Australians closer by developing a greater recognition 
that this nation's strength lies in the unity and commitment of its 
people, as represented by Australian citizenship. 

 "The citizenship 
kit will provide Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) students with 
information about our history, our democratic system of government and 
the benefits and responsibilities of becoming an Australian citizen. 

 "It will form part 
of a range of information provided to newly-arrived migrants and refugees 
under the AMEP. 

 "Australian citizenship 
is the symbol of our shared values - the values of democracy, equality 
of treatment, equality under the law, and equal opportunity for all." 

 The announcement follows 
a special ceremony at conference, in which Mr Ruddock conferred Australian 
citizenship on a group of new arrivals who are current or recent clients 
of the AMEP. 

 "By choosing to 
become Australian citizens, these people have made a very significant 
expression of their commitment to our nation," Mr Ruddock said. 

 "I hope that the 
new Australian citizenship kit will encourage more new arrivals to not 
only take up their right to formal membership of the Australian community, 
but to truly understand what it means to be an Australian citizen". 

 Mr Ruddock said the 
AMEP complements Australian citizenship by assisting new arrivals learn 
English and settle more successfully into the Australian community. 

 "As the only language 
program of its kind in the world, the AMEP is acknowledged as a world 
leader. 

 "Since it began 
in 1948, the AMEP has helped about one and a half million of Australia's 
new arrivals to learn English and is one of our key migrant settlement 
schemes." 

 The AMEP provides nine 
million hours of English language tuition a year, and last year assisted 
over 39,000 clients from 89 language backgrounds.
