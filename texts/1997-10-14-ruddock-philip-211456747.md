  Immigration Minister confers citizenship on 41 former  refugees  Citizenship will be conferred on 41 fonner refugees by the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, at a special ceremony in Brisbane tomorrow to mark  Refugee Week. 

  The 41 new citizens come from places as diverse as Ethiopia, Bosnia, Iran, Vietnam and  Mongolia. 

  The youngest new citizen is just three years of age, while the oldest is a 62 year old man from the  fonner Yugoslavia. 

  "Refugee Week gives all Australians time to think about people, who are fleeing from  persecution in various parts of the world," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "It is also an opportunity to acknowledge the important contribution that Australia has made over  many years, to helping refugees. 

  "Australia has a proud history of helping people who are fleeing persecution. In the past 50 years  half a million refugees have resettled in Australia and have contributed greatly to this nation." 

  In keeping with this year's Refugee Week theme, 'More than Half the World's Refugees are  Children', the citizenship ceremony will be held at the Brisbane State High School. 

  Students of the High School will play an important part in the ceremony. Hospitality students will  provide afternoon tea for the new citizens and guests, and a string quartet -part of the school  band -along with the school choir, will provide the entertainment.
