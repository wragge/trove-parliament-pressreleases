 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1153 TUESDAY 21 DECEMBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  Downer's Comments on Bakhtiyari Family Inflammatory and Offensive Senator Andrew Bartlett has criticised South Australian MP, Alexander Downer, for saying that a family seeking asylum have been 'making fools of Australians'. "This is the sort of mean and vindictive comments that the Government resorts to whenever they are faced with community concern about refugees," Senator Bartlett said. "The Bakhtiyari family's case is a difficult one for the Government, as it has been such a political football for so long that the Minister would not want to be seen to be backing down. Unfortunately, it is the family and especially the children who have been used as the football and they have been kicked around far too long." "The insulting and insensitive comments by Mr Downer show that when under pressure, the Government resorts to abuse." "As a South Australian, Mr Downer should know that the family has widespread support amongst the Adelaide community who know them to be genuine, decent people. In insulting the Bakhtiyaris, he is insulting the many people of his own state who have been supporting and living alongside the family. "I have followed this case closely for a long time and spoken to many people involved in it, and I believe Mr Bakhtiyari's claim to be Afghani is almost certainly true. Immigration Minister Vanstone would know - or if she doesn't she should - that there is a lot of evidence from credible sources to back the family's claim that they are from Afghanistan.  "However, this shouldn't be seen as a contest as to who is right and who is wrong. It should be acknowledged as a humanitarian tragedy, particularly for the children involved, and a decision made by the Minister on that basis." "The Minister should be big enough to make a decision in the public interest and the interest of this family that has already suffered enormously, rather than just saving face.  "I believe a solution can be found to this situation. The Minister can act without it forming a precedent and if she did I'm sure it would be welcomed by the majority of South Australians, whatever Mr Downer thinks."
