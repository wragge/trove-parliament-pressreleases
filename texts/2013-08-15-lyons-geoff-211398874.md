 EMPOWERING MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN TASMANIA    

 Northern Tasmanian residents from migrant and refugee backgrounds will benefit  from a new community space and new equipment at the Migrant Resource  Centre thanks to the Rudd Labor Government.

 The funding will be used to create a new community space at the centre, as well  as purchasing a PA system and BBQ.    

 “Australia’s diversity is one of our greatest strengths and that is why the Rudd  Government is proud to support organisations that promote cohesion and  inclusiveness,” Minister Lundy said.    

 “The MRC has been supporting our multicultural communities for over 30 years  and this funding will ensure this vital work continues into the future,” Minister Carr  said.    

 Mr Lyons said he was proud to be part of a Government that is supporting the  MRC continue its great work.    

 “The work that CEO John Brown and his team do at the Migrant Resource  Centre is invaluable in bringing the local community together and promoting a  sense of belonging in Northern Tasmania.”
