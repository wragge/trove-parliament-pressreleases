 Ghost of Abbott appears with Malcolm’s ‘Stop The Boats’ scare campaign 

 Malcolm Turnbull has revived Tony Abbott’s ‘stop the boats’ scare campaign on the  eve of the Federal Election, to the disappointment of moderate and progressive  voters across the country, the Australian Greens have said. 

 “Th



 e Prime Minister is getting desperate and is breathing life back into Tony Abbott’s  favourite scare campaign,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said. 

 “It’

 “Th



 e Ghost of Abbott’s reign has been haunting Malcolm Turnbull, but now we see  the new Prime Minister gleefully tearing chapters from his old foes’ playbook. 

 “A

 “Vo



 ters would be forgiven for thinking it was Groundhog Day as Abbott’s tired old  lines from 2013 are trotted out once again. 

 “T



 housands of Australians who hope Mr Turnbull would be a different type of Prime  Minister to Abbott will be deeply disappointed to hear him speak in such an alarmist  way about this issue.”
