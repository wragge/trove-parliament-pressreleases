 WHEN WILL THEY EVER LEARN

 The Prime Minister and Senator Evans have both failed to  learn from Senator Michael Tate's unfortunate experience in  "prejudicing a fair hearing". In Senator Tate's case a  trial was aborted. In the case of the Prime Minister and  Senator Evans it may be some time before the Courts will be 

 invited to comment on the propriety in commenting on refugee  status of individuals in advance of proper enquiry. ,

 But have no doubt the Courts may well, in due course, be  called upon to adjudicate in these matters.

 The administrative processes assessing case by case the  right to refugee status in Australia must be fair and just.

 After Chan's case before the High Court we know the  administrative process can be reviewed and supervised by the  Courts. No doubt its plans for refugee status are dismissed  now. The suspicion in the minds of asylum seekers from  Cambodia may well be that the effect.of the Prime Minister's 

 intervention, as well as that of the Foreign Minister, will  be such as to influence the public servants charged with  assessing their claims.

 There is no doubt that the Dors (Determination Of Refugee '   Status) Committee must assess claims independently. The  Committee is made up of representatives from the Departments  of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Prime Minister and  Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney  Generals.  It makes recommendations to the Minister for 

 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It is a pity that in  "Refugee Week" such abysmal lack of knowledge of refugee  criteria and assessment amongst Labor leaders should become  so blatantly apparent.
