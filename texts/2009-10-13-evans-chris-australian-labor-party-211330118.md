 Liberals bereft of immigration policy 

 Liberal backbench MP Philip Ruddock has made some claims on  asylum seekers based on nothing more than his own opinion. 

 I also note Philip Ruddock has called for the reintroduction of the  disgraced Pacific Solution and temporary protection visas (TPVs).  The Liberal Party was silent when these measures were scrapped  last year. Is this now Liberal Party policy or is it more division  within the Liberal Party? 

 The Liberal Party wants a debate on immigration policy but has no  policy other than to call for an inquiry.   The Liberal Party must  clarify today if they will bring back the Pacific Solution and if they  will bring back TPVs. 

 The facts are that temporary protection visas did not stop the  boats while the Pacific Solution left people languishing in  detention for years on end. There were 8455 irregular maritime  arrivals from 94 boats in the two years after the introduction of  TPVs in 1999, including 5516 arrivals in 2001 alone - many of  whom were women and children.  

 By the time TPVs were abolished last year, nearly 90 per cent of  people initially granted a temporary protection visa had been  granted a permanent visa to remain in Australia.  

 The reality is that there have been irregular boat arrivals to  Australia in 25 of the past 33 years. From 1999 to 2001 under the  Howard Government there were 12 176 boat arrivals. 

 These were mainly Afghans and Iraqis fleeing the brutal regimes  of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein. The Liberal Party didn't claim  then that pull factors caused those boat arrivals - and indeed they 

 weren't.  

 The Taliban regime fell at the end of 2001, and in 2003 Iraq was  invaded by Coalition forces and the Saddam Hussein regime  ended. The fall of these two brutal regimes saw boat arrivals to  Australia in the following years decline dramatically. By 2004,  more than 3.1 million people had returned home to Afghanistan. 

 In 2008 and 2009, we have seen a resurgence of mainly Afghan  and Sri Lankan asylum seekers who have fled their own countries  and are seeking safe haven in Europe, North America and  Australia. 

 To combat people smuggling the Rudd Government has retained  the excision of offshore islands and retained mandatory detention  and processing on Christmas Island for irregular maritime arrivals. 

 In this year's Budget, we committed $654 million for a  comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to combat people  smuggling and help address the problem of irregular maritime

 We have deployed extra resources through the Australian Federal  Police and Customs and Border Protection to Indonesia, Malaysia,  Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. 

 We are committed to dealing with asylum seekers humanely and  ensuring those people who are not refugees are returned to their  home countries.
