 RICHARD MARLES MP 

 SHADOW MINITSER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 MORRISON HIDES THE BOATS, HIDES THE TRUTH   

 Immigration Minister Scott Morrison flatly refused to explain his failed border  protection policies, despite repeated questioning in Parliament.    

 This was the Minister’s opportunity to once and for all tell the Australian people  the truth, and he failed.    

 His commitment to secrecy, and his contempt for the Australian people, is simply  breathtaking.    

 In the past few days, Mr Morrison has offended the Indonesian Government,  contradicted his Prime Minister and refused to confirm if a boatload of asylum  seekers from Somalia arrived in Darwin on Monday night.   

 The Australian people deserve to know what is happening on our borders. They  shouldn’t have to buy a copy of the Jakarta Post each morning to find out what  their Government is doing.  

 

 If Mr Morrison can’t stop the boats or buy the boats, the very least he can do is  to stop hiding the boats.   

 He can’t keep hiding the truth from Australians.
