 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration   

 AT LAST, MINISTER RUDDOCK GETS UP THE  COURAGE TO ACCEPT LABOR’S ADVICE TO  CLOSE WOOMERA   

 Minister Ruddock today announced the long overdue closure of the Woomera immigration  detention centre in South Australia.  For nearly fourteen months Labor has been calling for  exactly that, following Opposition Leader Simon Crean’s Australia Day 2002 address when  he called for children to be removed from behind the razor wire of detention.  

 

 I applaud the Minister for finally getting up the courage to accept the recommendations of  both his own advisory group and Labor that Woomera is no place for asylum seekers.    

 I note that the Minister has stated that the alternative detention trial in Woomera will remain  open, with residents having the option of staying there or moving to Baxter to be with their  husbands.  This trial has been very successful and I am pleased that it will continue.   

 However, the Minister remains empty-handed when it comes to announcing new  arrangements for children in detention, as he promised in his ministerial statement in  December last year.  Nothing he promised in that statement has been delivered and today’s  announcement is silent.  In the next parliamentary week, Labor will continue to press its  amendment to compel the Government to get children out from behind the razor wire.  Labor  reiterates its call to Liberal moderates to support this amendment.   

 The Minister also announced that Australia and Iran have signed a Memorandum of  Understanding on a range of consular issues.  Importantly, one of these is for the return of  Iranian nationals whose refugee claims in Australia have failed.  The MOU establishes  arrangements for voluntary returns along with repatriation assistance and Labor supports such  returns and the offer of assistance.  However, Labor will need to see the full details of the  MOU before making any specific comment on the other proposals.     

 

 Labor believes that the return of failed asylum seekers, particularly involuntarily, must be  monitored.  This is the ultimate test of the accuracy of a refugee claims processing system.
