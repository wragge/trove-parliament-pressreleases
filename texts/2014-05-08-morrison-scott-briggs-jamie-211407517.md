 Joint Media Release   

 8 May 2014 

 COALITION GOVERNMENT WILL CLOSE  INVERBRACKIE DETENTION FACILITY    

 The Coalition Government will close the Inverbrackie detention facility by the end of this calendar  year, in keeping with its pre-election commitment.   

 In October 2010, Prime Minister Gillard imposed this facility on the Adelaide Hills community,  without any consultation.   

 The announcement followed an expansion of the immigration detention network, which ballooned  under the Labor Government at significant cost.   

 In fact, the Inverbrackie detention facility has stood as a constant reminder of Laborâ€™s failed border  protection policies, budget blow outs and broken promises.   

 For over three years, we have promised that a Coalition Government would close this facility and  we are now delivering on this promise.   

 Under the Coalition Government, a sustained reduction in boat arrivals will lead to a draw-down of  our immigration detention network.   

 As a result, the Coalition Government will be closing five additional detention facilities by the end  of this year, including the Inverbrackie facility, and a further facility by mid-2015, saving  Australian taxpayers some $280 million over the forward estimates.   

 These closures are in addition to the four centre closures announced earlier this year.   

 Within a year of coming to office, the Coalition Government will have closed nine facilities.   

 In contrast, from 2008, the Labor Government opened 17 detention facilities
