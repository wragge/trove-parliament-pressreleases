 Australians urged to consider plight of refugee women 

 Sunday, 8 March 2009 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said International  Women’s Day (March 8) provided an opportunity for all Australians to recognise the  plight of vulnerable refugee women and children and Australia’s efforts to help them. 

 ‘The life of a single female or a female head of household in a refugee camp is very  hard and they often face violence, abuse and torture,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘The Australian Government’s ‘woman at risk’ program assists women and their  children in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) to help these families resettle and rebuild their lives in safety in Australia,  free from the constant threat of danger and violence.’ 

 The ‘woman at risk’ is a special visa category under the humanitarian program for  women and their children who are subject to persecution, are living outside their  home country and do not have the protection of a male relative. 

 It was introduced in 1989 in response to concerns from the UNHCR about the plight  of women and children refugees.  

 Since the introduction of the ‘woman at risk’ program, almost 9000 visas have been  granted. In 2007-08, about 820 visas were granted to women and children refugees  under the program. In 2008-09 to January 31, almost 500 visas have already been  granted.  

 Senator Evans said 13.7 per cent of the 13 014 refugee visas granted in 2007-08  were for the ‘woman at risk’ category, well ahead of the program’s 10.5 per cent  target.  

 The top countries of nationalities under the program in 2007-08 and into 2009  include Afghanistan, Burma, Bhutan, Burundi, Iraq, Somalia and the Democratic  Republic of Congo. 

 ‘Australians can be justifiably proud of our record in helping refugees and people in  need to resettle in Australia under the humanitarian program,’ Senator Evans said. ‘I  have also recently approved $12.8 million for international projects assisting  displaced persons and refugees, including vulnerable displaced women in Asia and  the Middle East.  

 ‘This includes $756 000 in funding for a CARE project in Afghanistan to improve the  economic conditions and reintegration of female Afghan returnees and displaced  people in Kabul. 

 ‘Through these and other measures, we are targeting our assistance to women who  are in danger of victimisation and serious abuse because of their gender. 

 ‘I would encourage all Australians to reflect on the new life and opportunities we are  offering this vulnerable group on International Women’s Day.’
