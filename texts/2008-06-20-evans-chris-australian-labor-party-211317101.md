 Australia balances refugee priorities 

 Friday 20 June 2008 

 Australia’s refugee and humanitarian intake for 2008-09 will help provide a new life  for 13 500 people who have fled their troubled homelands in Africa, Asia and the  Middle East. 

 Announcing the regional allocations for Australia’s Humanitarian Program on World  Refugee Day, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans said  that Africa, the Middle East and Asia will each be allocated a 33 percent intake, with  the remaining one percent allocated for contingencies. 

 In addition to this, a further 500 places have been set aside specifically for Iraqi  refugees in the coming year. Another 600 places were set aside in 2007-08 for Iraqis  who worked with Australian forces, and their families. 

 ‘The priorities were decided after considering views of the Australian community,  non-government organisations and the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘Over the next 12 months Australia’s refugee and humanitarian intake from Africa will  be 3548 people, an increase of 300 from last year. 

 ‘Refugees from Africa have experienced years of political strife, civil war and  persecution in countries such as Sudan, Liberia and Burundi before fleeing to  refugee camps. 

 ‘In the Asia region, ethnic minorities such as the Burmese refugees along the Thai-Burma border have been living in refugee camps for many years. 

 ‘We will also continue to resettle Bhutanese refugees from Nepal as part of the  international work to resolve this protracted problem. 

 ‘And in the Middle East, the unprecedented outflow of people from Iraq to  neighbouring countries Syria and Jordan presents a global refugee crisis.’ 

 Senator Evans said the decision showed the Australian Government was committed  to offering protection to refugees, regardless of their origin. 

 ‘The new priorities continue Australia’s commitment to refugees which has seen  more than 700 000 humanitarian entrants come to Australia since World War II,’  Senator Evans said. 

 ‘We will remain among the world’s top three humanitarian resettlement countries  alongside the United States and Canada.’ 

 Senator Evans also said that Australia has extended a guest of Government  invitation to UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres for an official visit  to Australia, at a time to be mutually agreed. 

 ‘We believe that this will present an excellent and timely opportunity to strengthen  the important relationship between UNHCR and Australia, and for Australia to share  the knowledge and expertise it has to offer with the UNHCR and - through it - the  international community,’ Senator Evans said.
