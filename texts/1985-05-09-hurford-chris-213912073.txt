 Federal grants worth $111,305 will enable 27 ethnic and  community organisations to develop welfare-related services  for non-English speakers (details of individual grants are  attached).

 The grants,  made under the Migrant Project Subsidy Scheme,   bring the 1984-85 total to 48, at a total cost of $200,000*

 Announcing the grants today, the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hurford, said the approved grants  included special services to the ethnic aged, women and  physically handicapped.
