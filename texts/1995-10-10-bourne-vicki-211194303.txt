  PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA THE SENATE 

  SENATOR VICKI BOURNE  Senator for New South Wales  Australian Democrats Whip 

  10 October, 1995 

  NEWS RELEASE 

  Democrats Support East Timorese 

  95/445 

  The Australian public would be outraged by a Federal Government appeal against the  granting of refugee status to East Timorese boat people according to the Australian  Democrats' Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Senator Vicki Bourne. 

  Senator Bourne, who was commenting on reports that the Government is considering  such an appeal in the event of refugee status being granted to 18 East Timorese said: 

  "Most Australians would be amazed to hear that a Government appeal would be on the  basis that these people are of Portuguese and not Indonesian nationality. 

  "Unfortunately, I do not believe this means that the Government has finally come to its  senses and at long last rejected Indonesia's brutal military invasion and subsequent  illegal occupation of East Timor. 

  "The Government's confused arguments and verbal gymnastics on this issue are worthy  of Catch 22 and bear the all too familiar mark of another attempt to placate Indonesian  sensitivity."
