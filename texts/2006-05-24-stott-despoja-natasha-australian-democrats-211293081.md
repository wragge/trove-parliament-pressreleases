 West Papuan asylum claim rejected

 The Australian Democrats have condemned the Department of Immigration's decision not to grant a visa  to the remaining West Papuan asylum seeker on Christmas Island.   

 "Given the Australian Government's recent moves to appease the Indonesian Government by agreeing  to sign a treaty recognising Indonesia's sovereignty over West Papua, this decision is very concerning,"  Democrats' Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said.   

 "It appears the Government is again kow-towing to Indonesia at the expense of human rights by refusing  to grant asylum in this case.    

 "It is essential Australia stands up to Indonesia about human rights concerns in West Papua.    

 "I firmly believe in the vital importance of a strong relationship between Australia and Indonesia, both for  bilateral purposes and for the region, but it is also essential we voice our concerns regarding human  rights, especially in our own region," Senator Stott Despoja said.   

 Democrats' Immigration Spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett said human rights abuses in West  Papua were contributing to the growing number of West Papuans seeking asylum in countries including  Australia.   

 "Extending the Pacific solution to the entire Australian continent will do nothing to stop the persecution of  West Papuans. A policy of deliberately targeting and punishing victims of abuses is a complete  disgrace," Senator Bartlett said.
