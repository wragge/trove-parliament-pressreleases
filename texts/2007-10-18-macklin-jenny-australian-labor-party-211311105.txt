 Report Wrong On Mandatory Detention  Media Statement - 18th October 2007 

 

 Jenny Macklin 

 Reports in this week’s edition of the Heidelberg & Diamond Valley Weekly (October 16) claiming that  Jenny Macklin pledged to abolish mandatory detention for asylum seekers at a recent Human Rights  Forum - are incorrect and the result of an error by the reporting journalist.    

 During the forum, I actually confirmed that Federal Labor would continue a period of mandatory  detention - excluding children - as detailed in Federal Labor policy.    

 The journalist who wrote the article has apologised to me personally for this error and will print a  correction in next week’s edition of the Heidelberg & Diamond Valley Weekly.
