 MEDIA RELEASE 

 31 May 2012 

 MIGRATION BILL THROUGH TO FINAL READING  

  THE “circuit-breaker” private member’s bill on asylum seeker policy in Australia has today  moved through the Parliament to the final stage of consideration. 

 The Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 was introduced by  Independent Lyne MP Rob Oakeshott. 

 “The progress of the Bali Process legislation through the second-reading stage of today’s  debate is a very welcome outcome,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “The result will allow for further debate and a final vote on the proposed legislation during  the next parliamentary sitting week from June 18. 

 “This Bill is an important step in progressing towards a longer-term regional solution on  people smuggling and people trafficking, as well as asylum.  It does not deny the place of  onshore assessment, but adds this option of offshore assessment to the range of options  available for executive Government. 

 “It allows for strong support for our international human rights obligations while at the same  time deals with the ramifications of last year’s High Court decision in relation to migration. 

 “And it starts to codify in domestic law our very good bipartisan work that has been on-going since 2002 through the Bali Process, co-chaired by Australia and Indonesia,”  Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “I welcome the support of fellow MPs who are concerned about finding a regional solution to  transnational crime, people smuggling and people trafficking and look forward to the  successful passage of the legislation through the remaining stages of the legislative  process.”
