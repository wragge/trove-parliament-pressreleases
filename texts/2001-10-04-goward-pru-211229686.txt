 WORLD CONFERENCE AGAINST RACISM HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION BRIEFING

 Speech by Pru Goward, 4 OCTOBER 2001, HREOC I joined the HREOC as federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner when the Sex Discrimination Unit was just finishing its community consultations with those with personal experience of the special confluence of racism and sexism. Since then, I have been able to follow the ideas gleaned from these consultation through to the World Conference Against Racism and back home again.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The involvement of SDU and myself were premised on the concept of "intersectionality", that is the intersection, or 'double burden' of race and gender experienced by Indigenous, migrant and NESB women in this country. The unit produced an issues paper concerning the intersectionality of race and gender which it published on the web and used to structure our consultation process.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I am pleased to say that the Commission has been consistently committed to keeping gender central to its involvement and contribution to the World Conference.

 At the conclusion of our Gender Race and Intersectionality paper, HREOC discussed how these issues could be addressed during its community consultation process. In its consultation process for the WCAR, HREOC made the following commitments:

 Making the experiences of racially disadvantaged women central to consideration of issues for the World Conference Against Racism, rather than an "add-on" to the experiences of men;

 â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Listening first to the people with direct experience of gender-and-race discrimination, and only then acting and speaking on what is learned.

 â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Also in the paper, HREOC set itself 2 challenges -how can HREOC best realise these commitments? And, how would HREOC best proceed to ensure the issues and concerns of racially disadvantaged women are addressed within the WCAR and beyond?

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I think the community consultations the SDU ran in the lead up to the conference answered the first challenge, while a commitment to enforcing and realising the plans of action which have come from the conference will determine our success in answering the second.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The intersection between gender and race is an important issue for human rights. The development of the conceptual constructs underlying this notion are a relatively new area for the Sex Discrimination Unit (and, from observation at the National Institutions meeting, clearly for other national institutions also). For this reason I was pleased that one of my first assignments upon taking up my position as SDC

 was to accompany the HREOC delegation to Durban.

 The need to return to Australia to attend the hearing of the IVF matter before the High Court necessitated a shortened visit and I was only able to attend the National Institutions Meeting and some of the NGO meetings up until Saturday 1 September.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The National Institutions meeting was not attended by all countries with national human rights institutions but it did include a significant number of African countries. The purpose of the meeting was to frame a statement for the WCAR. Although such a statement would not necessarily be reflected in the final communiquÃ© from the Conference, the meeting considered the drafting of the statement was an important step for national institutions; this WCAR being the first at which national institutions were to be given any separate standing. The meeting expressed its gratitude to the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner and in particular to those officers who attended (including her Chief of Staff, Brian Burdekin) for their efforts in promoting the role of national institutions at the WCAR.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Although intersectionality between racism and other forms of discrimination, including gender discrimination, was generally recognised by those participating at the meeting, there was considerable disagreement about the forms of additional discrimination to be included within the intersectionality section of the statement's preamble. The drafting committee, chaired by Canada, spent considerable effort in resolving this issue and the final and accepted draft only identified gender as a specific and additional ground. Other grounds were not identified in the preamble.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Interestingly, gender was an issue for many of the NGO and community groups working in preparation to the World Conference. A number of groups worked on getting gender prominently positioned in the conference discussions, including WRANA (Women's Rights Action Network) and ANCORW (Australian National Committee of Refugee Women).

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The significance of gender issues for racial discrimination was also reflected directly in the Declaration and Platform for Action at the World Conference.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 THE DECLARATION:

 With its concern to recognise and name the victims of racism, it was especially pleasing that the declaration highlighted the experiences of those women who experience racism in a different and sometimes doubled form. And in doing so, it identified women as particular victims of racism, and intersectionality as the mechanism by which this occurs.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 From the "General issues" section:

 3. We recognise that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, decent or national and ethnic origins and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination based on other related grounds such as sex, language, religion, political and other opinion, social origin, property, birth or other status"

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 68. We are convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a different manner for women and girls, and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination, and the limitation and denial of their human rights."

 This in no uncertain terms officially recognises what we have called intersectionality, as a mechanism by which all manner of discriminations can be compounded.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 From the introduction:

 Reaffirming that states have a duty to protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all victims, and that they should apply a gender* perspective, recognising the multiple forms of discrimination which women face, and that the enjoyment of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies through out the world;"

 * The footnote of this paragraph goes on to explicitly define gender as referring to the two sexes- thus specifically including women's social definition in relation to that of men, but precluding other forms of gender such as transgender.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Overall, the declaration explicitly recognises gender intersectionality as interlinked with racism, and also that race is a determining factor in the effects and practice of sexism. And goes further to identify that the elimination of this intersectionality is a part of any States human rights obligations.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 THE PLATFORM FOR ACTION:

 More than simply recognising gender as a confluent source or cause of racism, the conference went further to identify a gender perspective as part of the solution. In the platform for action the conference specifically and repeatedly recognised that including a gender perspective was essential to the success of any measure introduced to combat the effects of racism.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There are calls for State to follow suit, as the P.F.I urges them to;

 - include women in decision making (section 58), - include programmes specifically tailored to combat the confluence of race/gender (section 22) - include gender in the mechanisms that measure racism such as statistical collection (section 106), - and ensure that they mainstream a gendered perspective in the design of measures used to test how far we've come (section 68).

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 57. Urges States to incorporate gender perspective into all programmes of action against racism, racial intolerance and to consider the burden of such discrimination that falls particularly on indigenous women, African women, Asian women, women from African descent, women of Asian descent, women of migrants and women from other disadvantaged groups, ensuring that their access to the recourses of production on an equal footing with men, as a means of promoting their participation in the economic and productive development of their communities"

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 58. Urges States to involve women, especially women victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in decision making at all levels when working towards the eradication of such discrimination, and to develop concrete measures to incorporate race/gender analysis in the implementation of all aspects of the programmes and services and resource allocation;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 68. Urges States to mainstream a gendered perspective in the design and development measures of prevention, education and protection aimed at eradication of racism,

 racial discrimination, xenophobia and related in tolerance at all levels, to ensure that they effectively target the distinct situations of women and men.

 22. Requests States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of and in concert with indigenous women and girls, with a view to promoting their civil, political, economic social and cultural rights; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for their reasons of gender and ethnicity; to deal with urgent problems affecting them in regard to education, their physical and mental health, economic life and in the matter of violence against them, including domestic violence; and to eliminating the situating of aggravated discrimination suffered by indigenous women and girls on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Though of course these have to be enacted, these statements are clear and manage to strike a fine balance between the task of "mainstreaming" gender perspectives, and differentiating special measured tailored specifically for women.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 These sentiments specifically echo the finding of our consultations. Namely that not only must gender become one of the standard fronts on which we fight racism, but also that women who suffer the effects on intersectionality must have their particular experiences counted, and targeted by policies created specifically to include this double burden.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 It is reassuring to see that even on an international level the problem of the intersection between race and gender has been recognised and remedies are being promoted.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 It is now up to us to rise to the challenge set by these documents, and realise the measures proposed to recognise and remedy women's experiences of race/gender.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 This international recognition supports the interest taken in the intersectionality of race and gender by HREOC and I believe will ensure that the issue of gender remains prominent on the national, local and HREOC agenda, and that Commissioner Bill Jonas and I can continue to work closely to combat it at all levels.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I appreciate the opportunity to have been able to attend the conference, and look forward to continued cross-Commission projects.
