 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks for being here. Itâs great to be here with Christopher Pyne, the Shadow Minister for Education. Itâs  great to be here with my friend and colleague, former colleague Phil Barresi who is our candidate for Deakin  and of course was an extremely effective Member for Deakin between 1996 and 2007. Weâve also got some  of the students of the school and Iâve assured the students of the school that journalism is an honourable  profession and we will see fine examples of journalism at work this morning. So look, weâre announcing our  school education policy today and I want to stress at the outset that next to a good home a good school is the  fundamental building block of a good society. So the policy that we announce today is very important not  just for schools but really for the whole country. Obviously itâs very important that government do what it  can to ensure that our schools are well-funded, increasingly well-funded and we have high quality and  increasingly high quality teaching in our schools.   

 In a moment Iâm going to throw to Christopher to add more detail to the announcement today but I just want  to focus on two particular aspects of our school policy. The first is our $210 million Better Teacher Fund. It  is important that teachers get properly rewarded. I know that the salaries of teachers is essentially a matter  for the state government if weâre talking about state schools. Itâs substantially determined by industrial  negotiations across the board but we need to try to ensure that our best teachers get more money in their  pockets. We need to try to ensure that the professionalism of teachers is appropriately recognised and thatâs  what this fund is designed to do. A couple of particular features of this fund is that the awards will be made  by an independent board not by the state education departments and the principals will nominate teachers for  money under this fund and I think itâs very important that we empower principals as well as better reward  teachers in what we do in schools. The other element of the policy that Iâm very pleased to highlight is our  $120 million Technology Fund. This is about the high technology that schools need, itâs not simply saying  to schools âyou will get computers whether you like them or not.â So I think itâs a good policy. Itâs a  responsible policy. Itâs an affordable policy in a fiscally constrained environment and Iâll now ask  Christopher to add to it.   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

 Thanks Tony and itâs good to be here with Tony Abbott and Phil Barresi in Deakin. The difference between  the policies the Coalition has announced during the election campaign before and today, which are  encapsulated in the document that youâre being given, the difference between our polices and Laborâs is that  ours are actually achievable, theyâre modest, theyâre doable. Weâve heard a lot of promises from Labor in  the 2010 election which remind me of the promises they made in the 2007 election and letâs remember that  Labor promises big but they donât deliver. They promised 2,650 Trade Training Centres, theyâve delivered  22. They promised 260 child care centres, theyâve delivered just four that are operational. They promised  970,000 laptops in schools whether people wanted them or not, theyâve delivered about one-third and they  promised $16 billion to be spent on school halls and theyâve delivered about half the value. So Laborâs  promises that theyâre making now should be read in the context of the promises they made at the last  election and didnât deliver on.   

 Today weâre announcing two new aspects of the education policy which Tony has outlined, the School  Technology Fund and the Better Teacher Reward Fund, but theyâre on top of the other policies weâve  already announced. The Education Tax Rebate which comes in earlier at the beginning of the school year is  paid at a higher value than Laborâs, $500 for primary school children $1,000 for high school children and  can be used for every aspect of education, whether itâs fees, whether itâs extra costs for children with special  needs like dyslexia, uniforms, books, computers, whatever. And weâve also broken the back of how  disabilities are treated in Australia by establishing an Education Card which will be portable with the student  with disabilities to be taken to either a non-government or a government school and to be spent by that  school on those children. That gives parents with children with disabilities real choice which theyâve never  had before. So theyâre just some of the ideas that weâve announced in this campaign. Theyâre all modest,  achievable and doable and of course our record is following through with our promises and Laborâs is the  opposite.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, Iâm just going to make a few general observations and then weâll throw to questions. The first point I  want to make is that itâs increasingly obvious that the Gillard Governmentâs Parramatta to Epping rail line is  yet another infrastructure mirage from an increasingly desperate Labor Party. We know that just ten days  ago the State Labor Government didnât even have this railway on its ten year horizon let alone as the most  urgent infrastructure project in New South Wales. We know today that the head of the Department of  Transport and Infrastructure Mike Mrdak âwent ballisticâ when he was told about this. He hadnât been told  about it by his Minister. He hadnât been told about it by an official. He learnt about it from the media. It just  goes to show that these guys are making it up on the fly. It just goes to show that they have no real plans to  deliver. It just goes to show that they are trying to con the people of western Sydney as they are trying to con  the people of Australia. We have seen it all before from state Labor governments. Big promises before an  election, broken promises after an election. Donât let Labor con you again. Thatâs my message to the people  of western Sydney and to the people of Australia.    

 We also saw last night on The 7:30 Report the Treasurer Wayne Swan refusing to rule out a carbon tax.  Now, Julia Gillard has said repeatedly since becoming Prime Minister that she believes in a carbon price.  Bob Brown, who will hold the balance of power if Labor is re-elected thanks to the secret preference deal  with the Greens, he wants a carbon tax. As sure as night follows day, if this Government is re-elected, there  will be a carbon tax and what a carbon tax is, is a tax on your electricity, a tax on your power. Weâve already  seen electricity bills have gone up by 34 per cent since November 2007. They will go through the roof if the  Government is re-elected. Every time you turn on the light, youâll pay. Every time you open the fridge,  youâll pay. Every time you get into the shower, youâll pay. So, I call on the Prime Minister to say exactly  what will happen should the Government win the election. Itâs not good enough to fudge this. Itâs not good  enough to put it off to a Citizensâ Assembly. That is a complete abdication of responsibility. It is a complete  denial of democracy. I demand that the Prime Minister clarify exactly where the Government stands on the  coming electricity tax.   

 QUESTION: 

  3 

 

 Just on the teacher bonuses for quality teachers, how much would a teacher get; Labor was promising 10 per  cent of the salary which is a little bit over $8,000. Whatâs the quantum of what a teacher could get and how  many teachers could get the bonuses in a year?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Iâm going to ask Christopher to elaborate on this but essentially, we are establishing a board and principals  who will make application to that board. There will be guidelines for the applications, there will be  guidelines for the decision-making. The boards will decide what money teachers will get, what extra money  teachers will get and we are going to sit down and work out the precise details with the board after the  election. But if, for argumentâs sake, 10 per cent of teachers were to get the extra money and they were all to  get the same amount, that would work out at $6,000 a year. But Iâll ask Christopher to further elaborate.   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:   

 Thanks Tony. I think Tonyâs basically covered it. Of course, our scheme starts earlier. So we are starting a  year earlier. Laborâs is pushed off to the never, never, in which case, of course, it might be between about  $6,000 and $6,500 a year that a teacher received if the board decided that every teacher should receive the  same. Of course, we will appoint an independent board. They might well decide to pay less for some  teachers and more for others, depending on how they determine who have been the best quality teachers in a  particular year. It starts earlier which means that the same teacher, if they are rewarded for a couple of years,  would receive more under the Coalition than the Labor Party in those two years.    

 But the really defining difference between our policy and Laborâs is that we are going to bypass the states.  Weâre not going to establish these local committees of public safety in each school, where the AEU  representative, the bureaucrat from the Department of Education and the principals sit around and determine  which teachers, if any, get a bonus. We will make it independent. The principal will nominate who they  think their best teachers are to the board. The money will go directly to the teachers, not through the states.  So we wonât have this nightmarish scenario which weâve had under Labor where the money is funnelled  through state governments, whether itâs the national partnerships, whether itâs the disastrous school hall  stimulus debacle. All of those things that have been wasted by the states, where they siphon off money, we  lose it in bureaucracy. Weâre going to avoid all of that by paying it directly to the teachers and let the  principals, the teachers and the national board work it out.   

 QUESTION:   

 If this is one of your key education policies, isnât that a cop out to handball this onto a board? Is that $6,000  figure an average, is that what youâve got in your mind? Is there a cap?   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:   

 Well, Ashleigh, the difference between the Coalition and the Labor Party is that we actually trust principals.  We trust school communities. Thatâs why we would pay the remaining BER billions directly to schools to  self-manage and the government sector and allow them to keep the savings. Itâs because in our record in  government, we had the Investing in Our Schools programme where we paid the money directly to the  school communities for them to spend on their priorities. The difference between the Coalition and Labor is  that the Coalition trusts principals, we believe and value teachers and we want to give parents the support  they need to get their best education. The Governmentâs default position is that all of those people start with  wanting to rip the system off so you have to give it to state governments to do it. Now, state governments  are the problem in this area, not the solution. We believe principals and teachers and independence is the  solution.   

 QUESTION: 

  4 

 

 A question for you both. Mr Pyne, a question for you first. On, exactly how would you measure teacher  performance? Mr Abbott, are there any, youâve made a lot of promises during this campaign, are there any  circumstances in which you would deem acceptable to break those promises?   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:   

 We, in terms of the first question, there are obviously a set of principles about guidelines for teaching. State  education departments all have their own. We are establishing a national curriculum. There is a lot of  national involvement these days in education. The board would obviously have reference to those and we  would give the board a set of guidelines. We would want an emphasis, for example, on schools where there  is social disadvantage, so low SES schools, rural and regional schools, special needs schools. A lot of these  schools where the teachers are working above and beyond the call of duty and arenât recognised by the way  they are paid at the  moment by the states. We want to send the message to teachers that we do value them,  we know theyâre not paid enough and this is a down-payment on what a future Abbott government would be  able to achieve once weâve paid down the debt and deficit of the Labor Party.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Sabra, look, weâve been very careful not to make promises that we donât think are achievable. We think all  of our promises are deliverable and we will deliver on them.   

 QUESTION:   

 What do you think about the Governmentâs proposal to pay incentives to apprentices to complete their  training?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I think the problem with all the promises of this Government is the great deliverability question. Letâs  face it, they promised 2,650 Trade Training Centres. Just 22 of them are operational three years later. So, I  just think that the Australian public are entitled to be deeply sceptical about any of their promises, given that  they have comprehensively failed to deliver, given that they have demonstrated that theyâre the most  incompetent government in living memory.   

 QUESTION:   

 Thereâs been a steep fall in the number of people making use of IVF and thatâs been put down to the Rudd  Governmentâs cap on the safety net rebate for this procedure. You created the safety net. Would you keep  that cap or would you get rid of it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 This cap was another example of a broken promise by the Labor Party. A clear example of a broken promise  by the Labor Party and I think all of the people who have had higher out-of-pocket costs as a result of this  change, all of the people who have felt unable to access this service as a result of the change, they should  know who to blame. They should blame the Labor Party because this is their broken promise. Now, I am in  the fiscal position that we currently find ourselves not promising to undo the damage, I canât, but the fact is  people need to know who has done the damage and itâs a government which has broken a promise.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, you spoke to the kids inside about your love of surfing. Iâm just wondering, GetUp, the  organisation that paid for you to do that surfing lessons with the Afghan refugee Riz Wakil, whatâs 

  5 

 happened to that? They claim your office wonât return calls. Are you going to still give that surfing lesson  before the election or is it something youâre waiting until afterwards?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, look, I will give the lesson. I will give the lesson. I would like to do it pre-election but itâs a very busy  schedule and I donât know whether the surfing conditions would be appropriate between now and then, I  mean, he is a beginner. Iâm told that there are big waves predicted for next week. So, Iâd like to do it before  the election but I canât absolutely guarantee it.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, these promises today youâre paying with money out of the national partnerships programme.  How are you going to take $330 million out of that programme and not cut any services?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, weâre paying for the promises today through the announced savings. Thatâs where the money is  coming from. Now, unlike the government, we have announced, its now about $30 billion worth of  reductions in government expenditure that will more than pay for all the new commitments that we have  made. So, unlike the Government we have found the savings for our commitments and again, I challenge the  Government to identify exactly where the money is coming from for its spending commitments and I note  that Treasurer Swan made a big song and dance about putting proposals into the Treasury for costing and yet  he himself is going to break his own deadline for the shower of spending for the absolute reign of goodies  which we are going to see from the Government on Monday.    

 QUESTION:    

 Youâre promising a bigger net spend than him in this election and yet youâre talking about Labor spending  and all this sort of thing. How, exactly what are your promises at the moment, where are your savings and  will you comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We will have all our policies credibly and independently costed well before polling day and we certainly  want to comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty but the fact is, you just canât trust this Government not  to play politics and until they have tracked down the source of this leak, this leak that we believe has been  perpetrated in breach of the law, we donât believe that we can.   

 QUESTION:    

 I ask you to be specific, in your document here, these programmes today, “the $210 million for better  teachers and $120 for school technology, will be funding through efficiencies in the national partnerships”.  What are the efficiencies and can you guarantee that wonât mean a cut to services?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Ok, Iâll ask Chris to handle that one.    

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:    

 There are a number of national partnerships that range over different aspects of curriculum and teacher  quality and so forth. Weâll be doing two things in terms of funding in the entire education policy document.  One of course, is the savings that have already been announced by Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb and then 

  6 

 more savings were added at the beginning of the election campaign, so indeed we have actually quite a  wellspring of savings that have been made. Secondly, we donât trust or want to continue to support the  national partnerships in the way the current government has done through the states. Stakeholders in the area  will tell you that the national partnerships are adulterated in as much as the state governments are giving the  money out to the non-government sector but that theyâre also competitors with the non-government sector  for the same services. Now, that doesnât work. Labor thinks it does, of course, because they trust the  bureaucracy and they trust the State Labor Governments. So we will restructure the national partnerships  and as a consequence of cutting the states out of delivering a lot of these monies to schools, weâll be able to  make savings in those as well.    

 QUESTION:    

 Thereâs been a lot of discussion this week about the stimulus and youâve identified some savings during this  election campaign but thereâs a huge amount of money being spent on the stimulus that you could save but  youâve never identified any cuts to that. Why havenât you identified any cuts to that and if youâre not willing  to cut it, are you willing to delay it to push some of the money further back?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The point I want to make is that all of our election commitments are fully costed and fully funded, unlike  Labor's. I mean, Julia Gillard and here Ministers and her MPâs have been going around the country like  Santa Claus, distributing presents from the sack to all comers. Now, none of these have been appropriately  funded. There have been no spendings cut announced by the Government. No spending cuts whatsoever. We  have had the guts to say to the Australian people, look, we will spend this extra money but it is going to be  affordable and it is going to be affordable because here are the spending reductions that will fund it and I  challenge the Government which claims to be fiscally responsible to have the same level of integrity,  political integrity that weâve shown throughout this process.    

 QUESTION:    

 [inaudible] if both sides arenât going to comply with it?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I think itâs very important that we have integrity in government and when you have leaks from out of  Government about Opposition policy, the way weâve seen, youâve got to question whether there is integrity  in government. If we can be confident there is integrity in government, we will fully comply with the  Charter of Budget Honesty, but that means properly investigating the source of this leak and appropriately  punishing the person who broke the law in this way.    

 QUESTION:    

 Your side was quite happy to take leaks from Treasury when Godwin Grech was working for them so I  mean, whatâs the difference? I mean, these things happen. Why wonât you just comply with the Charter of  Budget Honesty though?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   The point I make is for the Charter of Budget Honesty to work, youâve got to have an honest government  and a government which dishonestly leaks material from the Treasury about the Coalitionâs policy is a  fundamentally dishonest Government. Now I make this clear, absolute commitment. All of our policies will  be independently costed and the independent verdict on our policies will be released, but unless, unless the  Government takes appropriate action against this criminal leak, we cannot trust this Government to do the  job properly so weâll do the job properly. Thank you.
