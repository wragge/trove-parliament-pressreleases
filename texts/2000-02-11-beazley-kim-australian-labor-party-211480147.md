  Transcript - Kings Park, Perth - 11 February 2000

  

  E & OE - Proof Only

  

  JOURNALIST: John Howard has met workers at Braybrook 
who have been told no compensation for them. Is that fair? 

  

  BEAZLEY: Well, he wouldn't meet them when he 
should have - which is when they were up in Parliament and presenting 
their case to them. And, no - it is not fair. The situation that has 
arisen is a product of directly of them not having done what they should 
have done when they first promised the Australian people that they would 
put in place a universal scheme. Now we have suggested a scheme which 
is affordable and I think they are inching their way towards it. They 
ought to gallop towards it and they ought to look seriously at what 
they might be able to do about assisting people who have experienced 
that which the Braybrook workers have experienced. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Drawing his January 1st line in the 
sand is a reasonable proposition, is it not, and responsible?

  

  BEAZLEY: Well, I would say that he needs to have 
a more generous heart than that and take a look at these things. There 
may be something additional that he can do. But he has got a major responsibility 
on his hands and that is his failure to act when he said he would. We 
have had a proposition to him. We have had several Bills in Parliament 
which would have helped as well in that regard and he has just chosen 
to ignore it and just delay and delay and now we have what we see which 
is an appalling injustice for a large number of Australians. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Do you view his actions over National 
Textiles as corrupt? 

  

  BEAZLEY: I would not characterise the thing that 
way. I would characterise it in a way in which I have already said it. 
And that was - that while I have welcomed the fact that the workers 
have got a pay out - who could not when you see the circumstances that 
they confront and the circumstances in which they find themselves - 
it would have been a wiser man who would put himself at an arm's length 
when a relative was involved. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Do you share that view that he in 
fact by putting up this and trying to get this agreement, this deed 
of agreement, that he is in fact protecting his brother from any further 
examination? 

  

  BEAZLEY: Well, others have said that. What I 
say is - that when this matter was considered by Cabinet and he advised 
them that he had a conflict of interest a less sycophantic Cabinet would 
have suggested his exit and that is precisely what should have happened. 
And what I say now is this - to assist overcoming those impressions 
it would be very wise for him to announce that he is placing the entire 
matter in the hands of the Deputy Prime Minister and standing aside 
from it. We all have relatives and some of our relatives engage in business 
and if we are in Government the possibility that what they are doing 
will come across our tracks is always there, it is unavoidable. The 
question is how you handle it when it happens. In his case to stand 
to one side from it was an appropriate course and, I think, he half 
recognised it himself but he didn't act on it.

  

  JOURNALIST: The ASIC inquiry. Do you welcome 
that?

  

  BEAZLEY: Yes. That is a good thing that there 
is an inquiry but I think if you are looking for the underlying problem 
here, what is the fundamental cause of the situation in which the Government 
found itself? And the fundamental cause is the inability on their part 
to get together a scheme which covered peoples' retirement and other 
entitlements. 

  

  JOURNALIST: How fair is it, that people from 
January 1st will be helped but those before won't be?

  

  BEAZLEY: As I said - I hope the Prime Minister 
takes a generous view of his strictures as far as that is concerned. 
Those Braybrook workers tried very, very hard with him and others have 
as well and I do think that he needs to keep an open mind. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, have you been embarrassed 
by the letter of support that you wrote on behalf of Esmeralda to the 
Romanians?

  

  BEAZLEY: I am worried about the environmental 
situation that has arisen. Esmeralda is clearly entitled to a proper 
investigation of that. I see that they are disclaiming responsibility. 
I don't know whether it is negligence or an accident or what it is that 
has caused it. I would hope that having been at least part of the problem 
that they would make themselves part of the cure. But I do write away 
for many Australian companies I have got to tell you. I first take recognisance 
of whether or not others in the Government are supporting them, when 
I was in office that is. Others in the Government were supporting it 
and whether or not they were a viable, responsible people and then acting 
accordingly. Ministers have to do that. That is how we assist Australian 
companies to do business overseas. So, there is one letter out that 
I wrote on their behalf, and you could dig through my files and find 
quite a few on behalf of other people. 

  

  JOURNALIST: There is a suggestion there may be 
a need for a very big increase in defence spending coming up, or existing 
programs may have to be cut.

  

  BEAZLEY: That is always a problem in relation 
to defence particularly when you are moving into a period of bloc obsolescence. 
The problem is not quite there yet but will be there within the next 
decade. $106 billion does sound an enormous amount and that seems to 
be identified as the amount. I would point out, from recollection, there 
is about $4 billion a year spent on defence. So over 20 years in constant 
dollars that would be about $80 billion. So, I would be very interested 
to see those reports. The Government has said and I certainly have said 
that there is probably a case here for increased defence expenditure 
if we are going to be able to deal with the needs of our Defence Forces 
in a high technology environment. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Do you support increasing defence 
expenditure?

  

  BEAZLEY: I wouldn't put a dollar figure on it, 
but I have said that before. 

  

  JOURNALIST: On the jobs figures. Mr Costello 
suggested that the job rates could be as low as 6.5 per cent by June. 
How realistic is that?

  

  BEAZLEY: Well depends on how many people they 
manage to drive out of the workforce. Every fall below 7 per cent when 
it has come below 7 per cent has been a product of a lowering of the 
participation rate. I am still surprised that after nine years of good 
growth, or ten years now, nearly, of good growth in this economy that 
we have a participation rate lower than when this Government came into 
office. So it is a statistic that is produced by people exiting the 
workforce. What I think we need is a statistic that is produced by skilling 
the population and we would therefore see far less long term unemployment 
than we now see, particularly very long-term unemployment but they are 
still the ones held out of the labour market. Even though we have got 
a better employment environment than we have had for some time people 
are staying out and staying on benefits longer under this Government 
than they were before.

  

  JOURNALIST: Phillip Ruddock and Premier Court 
are heading up to Curtin Airbase today, to look at the problems in that 
detention centre. What do you envisage should be coming out of their 
visit to help ease the situation there?

  

  BEAZLEY: I am not sure what the situation is 
up there. Obviously people ought to be kept in humane circumstances 
who come to this country whether legally or illegally. That ought to 
always be the case. 

  

  JOURNALIST: ...hunger strikes and poor conditions...

  

  BEAZLEY: But I must say - that when our people 
and there was a joint Parliamentary Committee went there, I think, not 
so long ago. When our people went up there they did not have that view 
that there was a major problem. Now that may have developed recently, 
I don't know but I will be very interested to see what they have to 
say when they get back. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Do you think that there is, in fact, 
a genuine need for, and review is being undertaken, but do you think 
there a genuine need for permanent detention centres rather than the 
camps like they are using at Curtin.

  

  BEAZLEY: Well as I said previously - an all Party 
Parliamentary Committees looked at these things and were not prepared 
to characterise the accommodation in terms in which it has recently 
been characterised. So a review I think here would be appropriate to 
arrive at a conclusion like that.

  

  JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, regarding mandatory sentencing 
with the overnight death of a 15 year old boy, WA being a State where 
we have mandatory sentencing. What is your thought on that?

  

  BEAZLEY: I have not had a problem with it to 
this point but I think that case actually is a pretty fair indication 
that it ought to be looked at. And I think mandatory sentencing is in 
all probability to inflexible and also frequently too expensive. Too 
expensive of life, and too expensive of public resources. So I hope 
in the Northern Territory that the Chief Minister up there doesn't just 
dismiss it, dismiss this terrible event in the way in which he has and 
he will take a careful look at the operation of his own laws to make 
sure that they perform satisfactorily.

  

  JOURNALIST: What was your reaction to his dismissal 
which was to say ... sent to his room ... that you can't put blood on 
me, there will always be deaths in custody?

  

  BEAZLEY: I suppose as parents we have all sent 
children to their rooms but I don't think it is an appropriate analogy 
in this case. We are not dealing here with a parental situation; we 
are dealing here with a law enforcement and incarceration situation 
and in circumstances where we have had numerous reports on Aboriginal 
deaths in custody which indicate a real substantial problem and a charge 
upon us all. I think that this is a terrible tragedy, which has occurred 
to a young man, a dreadful tragedy. And it deserves more than a dismissive 
response. 

  

  JOURNALIST: Should WA review its three strikes 
and you're in policy?

  

  BEAZLEY: I think when something like this occurs, 
it would be wise for them to find out why.
