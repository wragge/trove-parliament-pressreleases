 UNCERTAINTY OVER REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT    

 Serious questions have been raised about how many refugees will be considered for  resettlement in the United States and the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton needs to  immediately release basic information about the deal.    

 Last night, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton confirmed the United States Government  had indicated there was a limit to the number of refugees they would resettle:    

 Laura Jayes: …has the United States discussed a number with you that  you’re not willing to tell us?    

 Peter Dutton: Yes and I’m not willing to detail that…

 Peter Dutton needs to immediately provide answers to questions including:     

 ï· When will the first refugees be resettled?    

 ï· How many refugees will be able to be resettled in the US?     

 ï· How long will it take to process everyone who is being resettled?    

 ï· What will happen to those genuine refugees who aren’t able to go to America?    

 Confusion created by media reports and the Turnbull Government’s unwillingness to  answer basic questions is putting the success of this deal in doubt.    

 Labor wants every refugee who is eligible to have the opportunity to apply to go to the  United States under this agreement.    

 The United States isn’t a catchall solution and Mr Dutton needs to explain what other  options, and other resettlement arrangements, the Turnbull Government is negotiating  on behalf of those genuine refugees who are unable to go to America.    

 Labor’s policy is clear.  We will never let the people smugglers back in business.    

 Labor believes in strong borders, offshore processing and boat turn backs when it’s safe  to do so because we know it saves lives at sea.    

 The Turnbull Government needs to get refugees off Manus Island and Nauru, and end  their long-term detention.
