 Budget 2010-11—Humanitarian program  Tuesday, 11 May 2010 

 The Australian Government will continue its commitment to providing refuge for the  world's most vulnerable people by again accepting 13 750 people through its  humanitarian program in 2010-11. 

 The overall size of the migration program will also remain unchanged. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today  Australia would again welcome 13 750 refugees and others in humanitarian need. 

 'There will be a total of 6000 places in the refugee program primarily for those who  have been referred to Australia for resettlement by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR],' Senator Evans said. 

 There will also be 7750 places in the special humanitarian program, which includes  people in need who have links to Australia as well as those people who are already  in Australia, have sought Australia's protection and have been found to be refugees  under the Refugees Convention. 

 'The main resettlement focus will continue to be on refugees from the three key  regions of Africa, Asia and the Middle East,' Senator Evans said. 

 Within those regions, of particular interest will be those refugees in protracted  situations, such as the Bhutanese in Nepal, along with others in critical need. 

 Vulnerable women will again be a priority through the 'woman at risk' program, which  the Government increased to 12 per cent of the refugee component of the program  last year. 

 'We will also continue to work closely with neighbouring countries to meet the  evolving challenge of increasing numbers of displaced people in our region,' Senator  Evans said. 

 'Where protection and support is needed, Australia will continue to share the  responsibility.' 

 Some people will be resettled in regional locations in Australia where there are  employment possibilities and a supportive environment to aid in the settlement  process. 

 'Displacement of people continues to happen around the world and we should be  very proud of Australia's history in playing its part in providing refugees with  protection,' Senator Evans said. 

 'The Rudd Government is committed to a humane and fair refugee and humanitarian  program. This is something our nation has always done well.'
