 US REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT 

 

 Labor welcomes confirmation that the first round of refugees on Manus Island and  Nauru will shortly receive offers of resettlement as part of the US Refugee Resettlement  Agreement.   

 Labor strongly supports the US Refugee Resettlement Agreement and the ongoing role  of the UNHCR in endorsing refugee claims as part of this agreement.     

 We wish those refugees who are about to resettle in the United States a safe journey as  they begin their new lives in America.   

 Labor offers our gratitude to the United States for their ongoing commitment to resettling  refugees who have been on Manus Island and Nauru for almost four years while waiting  for the Turnbull Government to negotiate third country resettlement options.    

 Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have  become places of indefinite detention under the Abbott-Turnbull Government.   

 Labor wants eligible refugees off Manus Island and Nauru and resettled in third  countries as soon as possible. It is essential for Peter Dutton to continue to seek other  third country resettlement agreements.   

 Laborâ€™s policy on asylum seekers is clear. Labor will never let the people smugglers  back in business.   

 Labor believes in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and boat  turn backs when it is safe to do so because we know it saves lives at sea.
