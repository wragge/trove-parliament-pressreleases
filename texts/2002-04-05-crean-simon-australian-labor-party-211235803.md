 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN TOWARDS OPPORTUNITY AND PROSPERITY CONFERENCE MELBOURNE

 5TH APRIL 2002

 The theme of this conference is Opportunity and Prosperity.

 We  need  to  go  further  and  make  it  explicit  that  we  mean  opportunity  and prosperity for all.

 Australia needs a strong economy and a just society if we’re to be all that we can be.

 In fact, we can’t be a strong economy unless we are a just society.

 Today I want to explain how the reviews of Labor’s policies and structures will help us create a strong economy and a just society.  How we will modernize Australia to move to the next step-up in productivity and become a nation of high-income growth.

 This modernization must work its way right through our society.

 It  has  to  start  at  the  top  with  our  political  institutions,  extend  to  our economic, taxation and social policy and include our key infrastructure.

 A constructive partnership to build the nation

 Modernization of the kind our nation needs will never be easy.

 Australia needs leadership that is prepared to build support for reform that is in the national interest.

 Take  population  policy  as  an  example.   I  spoke  of  this  more  fully  back  in February.

 2

 Australia needs to be open to people with talent and skills to help boost our productivity,  ensure  economic  growth  and  create  more  jobs.   And  we  need more  people  in  states  like  Tasmania  and  South  Australia  where  population levels are stagnating.

 Scapegoating  migrants  and  refugees  makes  it  difficult,  quite  apart  from  the damage it’s done to our international standing.

 But with leadership and a comprehensive population policy we can convince people who feel threatened that they won’t be left behind.

 On  this  issue,  as  in  others,  we  need  to  get  federal,  state  and  local governments  working  together  with  the  whole  community  in  a  constructive partnership  to  modernize  the  nation.   A  Whole  of  Governments  approach through  a  Heads  of  Government  commitment,  with  local  government  also having a seat at the table.

 People are sick of Governments passing the buck.

 COAG  has  been  in  existence  for  ten  years  and  has  ossified.   It  needs  new vitality.

 Where Howard sees COAG as a threat, I see it as an opportunity.

 I have already commenced building a partnership with the state premiers to lay  the  foundations  of  a new  federalism.   Population  policy  must be  on  the agenda as must also be land clearing, climate change and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.

 This  approach  is  also  the  only  way  to  deal  with  the  overlapping  state  and federal  responsibilities  in  health  and  education.   These  issues  may  seem intractable, but they can be addressed through a constructive partnership.

 It’s worth noting that John Howard wrote to Premiers yesterday stating that education, health and aged care are not important enough at the moment to be dealt with by the nation’s leaders.  I have a different view.

 A partnership with unions and business

 I have always adopted the concept of a partnership in my relations with the union movement and business.

 Labor  can  and  will  work  with  unions,  big  business,  small  business  and  the self-employed to create wealth and jobs and to share the benefits around.

 We must build the partnerships for modernization that no political wedge can destroy.

 3

 A partnership for the future.

 Only Labor believes in this.  Only Labor can deliver it.

 Australia also needs to build partnerships on the international stage.

 We have to better engage with Asia and work more effectively within international frameworks for trade, security and humanitarian advances.

 This Government has done nothing over the last six years on the international scale except downgrade Australia’s international reputation.  A reputation that took years to build up.

 The challenge for Australia is to recapture the active leadership position we held in the region under previous Labor governments.

 Rather  than  see  international  fora  as  critics  we  must  understand  that Australia’s  fundamental  national  interests  lie  in  the  development  and promotion of strong international institutions.

 Australia  built  a  reputation  in  the  past  for  leadership  through,  for  instance, constructing APEC.  The Howard Government has dropped the ball.  We need to pick it up again.

 Australia can either remain isolated and irrelevant in its own region, or it can choose to be engaged; choose to show leadership.

 I will say more about this in the coming weeks.

 Modernizing our political institutions

 I  began  the  parliamentary  year  by  proposing  measures  to  modernize  our parliament and executive government in order to rebuild trust in our nation’s political institutions.

 Among  other  measures  I  proposed  the  creation  of  a  truly  independent Speaker, the reform of Question Time and a cooling-off period during which Ministers cannot accept employment relating to their previous responsibilities as ministers.

 We need to take reform of our political institutions even further.  Four-year terms for our national parliament, for example.

 To  succeed,  measures  such  as  these  require  bipartisan  support.   I  will continue to take the lead on these issues.

 I am disappointed that the Howard Government so far hasn’t got on board.

 4

 I have no doubt our opponents see an advantage for themselves in opposing political reform.

 As  a  recent  book  by  two  young  political  scientists  -  David  Burchell  and Andrew  Leigh  -  points  out,  it  suits  conservatives  if  the  voters  say  “well, they’re all the same, you can’t trust any of them”.

 The more voters distrust politicians, the less likely they are to support parties that actually want to use government to make significant changes - like build a knowledge economy and make life easier for families.

 We must rebuild that trust if we are to modernize the nation.  It starts with cleaning  up  and  modernizing  the  parliament,  and  that’s  what  my  proposals are all about.

 Modernizing Labor

 To modernize Australia, Labor must modernize itself.

 I have commissioned the Hawke-Wran review to ensure that change will be thorough and substantial.

 It will be about creating a modern, more inclusive, more democratic and more successful Labor Party.

 A  party  that  doesn’t  reward  branch  stackers  but  does  reward  quality candidates.  I want us to be judged by the quality of the candidates we put forward.

 And it will be about new policies for the future.

 If it is to lead change, Labor must be more in touch with the changes occurring in our society.

 I  can’t  imagine  a  Labor  Party  without  a  strong  relationship  with  the  trade union movement.  We both represent working people and their families.  But we have to acknowledge that the workforce has changed and that as a result, we must change too!

 Here’s the extent of change:

 â¢ In 1995 almost 40 percent of the Australian workforce were employed in the predominantly blue-collar and highly unionized industries of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, manufacturing, power, construction, wholesale trade and transport.  Last year that figure fell to 35 percent.

 5

 â¢ In  1995  there  were  1.65  million  casual  employees  in  the  workforce. Today the figure is more than 2.1 million.  We know that casual workers are far less likely to be unionized than permanent ones.

 â¢ Since 1995 the number of self-employed people in the usually heavily unionized construction industry has increased by 26 percent.

 â¢ And  in  1995  35  percent  of  the  workforce  were  members  of  trade unions.  Today that figure stands at 24.5.

 That’s all happened in just 6 years!

 Clearly,  modernization  is  needed  if  the  Labor  Party  is  going  to  continue  to represent a broad cross section of society.

 Links with the union movement will remain strong, but we must complement them  with  greater  connections  to  and  better  relations  with  small businesspeople, the self-employed and young people.

 This  modernization  has  already  begun  with  the  announcement  of  my  front bench.

 Don’t just look at the new faces in the shadow ministry, look at the structure.

 I haven’t just copied John Howard’s ministerial structure and given people a tagging role.

 I’ve thought seriously how we create portfolios that combine the objectives of creating a strong economy and a just society.

 There  are  new  cabinet-level  portfolios,  like  Small  Business,  Family  and Community  Services,  Regional  and  Urban  Development,  Population, Reconciliation, and the Environment; forward-thinking responsibilities such as Economic  Ownership;  and  new  combinations  of  portfolios  like  Employment, Education, Training and Science, and Innovation, Industry and Trade.

 Those portfolios and others tell a story about what we want to do: build the nation sustainably, create opportunities for more people, make life easier for families, tackle poverty and injustice, modernize the economy and with it our society.

 Modernizing our economy

 The  key  to  creating  a  better  future  for  all  Australians  is  improving  our productivity growth.

 We  won’t  succeed  unless  we  continue  to  modernize  the  economy.   That doesn’t mean ignoring existing industries and chasing new ones.

 6

 We have to better engage the new and emerging growth sectors and we have to make old industries new again.

 The Howard Government’s vision is a low-wage, low-skill economy.  Ours is a high-skill knowledge economy, but one that also has wage justice for the low skilled.

 Australia made great gains in the 1980s and 1990s because of the protection-reducing,  competition-enhancing  reforms  of  the  Hawke  and  Keating Governments.

 Since then we’ve performed well by quickly and effectively absorbing enabling technologies developed overseas.

 But we can’t make this the entire basis of our future economic strategy.

 We now have to position Australia closer to world’s knowledge frontiers.

 Just as our standard of living threatened to decline when the rest of the world decided it no longer  needed so much  of  our  primary  produce  in  the  1980s, our standard of living will decline if our rate of absorption of innovation slows.

 What a tragedy it would be if five years from now our national leaders had to declare  once  again  that  that  the  nation  was  in  deep  trouble  because governments failed to invest enough in innovation and education.

 No more speeches about becoming a banana republic!

 Australians must control their own destiny.

 It’s not enough to be competitive, we must also become more productive.

 We must invest in the drivers of employment and productivity growth.

 Jenny Macklin has addressed these issues in her speech to this conference.  I want  to  reinforce  her  message  and   emphasize  the  point  that  skills  are  the key  to  improving  an  individuals’  employability.   Economic  growth  is  in  itself not enough.   True labour market flexibility today lies in the skills agenda - better matching the supply of labour with demand.

 Australia must step up to the next level of productivity growth by becoming fast innovators, not just fast followers and adapters.

 There  are  three  sources  of  productivity  growth:   investment  in  physical capital, human capital and innovation.  How have we performed?

 7

 â¢ In  recent  years  investment  in  capital  has  been  disappointing  with  an average  annual  growth  rate  of  just  2.2  percent  in  private  new  capital expenditure since 1996.  This compares with an average annual rate of 14.7 percent  in  the  three  years  to  1996  and  4.5  percent  in  the  period  1987  to 1996.

 â¢ Real  business  R&D  expenditure  has  fallen  every  year  of  the  Howard Government after rising significantly under the previous Labor Government.

 â¢ And the Howard Government has cut $3 billion out of higher education spending.   No  wonder  Rupert  Murdoch  has  said  that  our  universities  are  in crisis.

 It is well acknowledged that the step up in productivity in the 1990s was off the back of the economic reforms of the Hawke and Keating Governments in the 1980s and 1990s.

 Unlike the United States, Australia is yet to reap the productivity benefits of the  revolutionary  technological  changes  in  the  information  and communications  sector  that  spectacularly  boosted  growth  in  the  U.S.  in  the 1990s.   We  need  to  make  this  next  step  in  again  structurally  lifting  our productivity.

 Governments  must  assist  both  the  production  and  diffusion  of  technological change  through  the  economy.   Greater  effort  is  needed  to  boost  R&D,  skill formation, capital expenditure and broadband connectivity.

 Connecting Australia

 Connecting the nation is fundamental to future productivity increases.

 More affordable access to the latest telecommunications services continues to be a major challenge for the Australian economy.

 Telecommunications is a major embedded cost for businesses today.  Small business has identified the cost of telecommunications as their third highest concern - well ahead of the Government’s obsession - unfair dismissals.

 More  affordable  access  is  a  precondition  for  the  emergence  of  vital  new industries - largely content driven - but it also generates significant savings and efficiencies for existing businesses.

 More  affordable  access  can  also  enable  our  families  to  access  the  latest  in education,  health,  government  and  commercial  services,  no  matter  where they live.  It can help put services back, where they have been taken away.

 More affordable access improves both efficiency and equity.  It is essential to our opportunity and prosperity.

 8

 Telecommunications  is  now  about  more  than  the  standard  telephone connection.   It’s  about  getting  the  nation  connected  to  the  information economy.

 Unfortunately, the policy debate in Australia has become excessively narrow, focussing on Telstra and its ownership.

 This  has  come  at  the  expense  of  the  more  important  issues  of  service, competition and access.

 Unfortunately, all Australians are paying the price.

 Telstra  has  been  allowed  to  milk  its  monopoly  position  at  the  expense  of families and businesses.  For example:

 â¢ Mobile phone calls, text messages and Internet fees have all gone up.

 â¢ Some schools face Internet charge increases of up to 1000 per cent.

 â¢ The poor service problems in regional and rural Australia persist.

 â¢ We are 16th in the world in terms of broadband use.  We need to be a leader.

 Inadequate  competition,  not  majority  public  ownership,  is  causing  these problems.

 Telstra still occupies 75 percent of the telecommunications market and earns over 90 percent of the profits.

 The  regulatory  regime  is  simply  not  working.   Privatizing  more  of  Telstra won’t solve it.  I defy proponents of full privatisation to prove otherwise.

 That’s because releasing the 800-pound gorilla from its cage will not end this monopoly.  It will only make it worse.

 Our position on the further sale of Telstra has not changed.  Labor will retain majority public ownership of Telstra.

 The fixation of some commentators and the Government with privatisation is actually  clouding  and  avoiding  the  essential  next  wave  of  reform  that  our telecommunications sector needs.

 Just  as  Labor  is  reviewing  its  policy  approach,  I  urge  those  who  think  full privatization solves the problem to also review their position in this context.

 9

 Inadequate competition is bad for consumers, bad for the nation and in the long-run bad for Telstra and its two million mum and dad shareholders.

 Labor’s  policy  review  will  explore  the  best  means  to  make  Australia’s telecommunications  market  deliver  better  outcomes  for  families,  schools, businesses and the nation.

 Labor will place Australian consumers at the centre of our policy - and ask: how  can  we  ensure  better  service,  cheaper  calls  and  broadband  Internet access that is the envy of the rest of the world?

 My  Communications  spokesperson  Lindsay  Tanner  will  explore  further changes  to  the  competition  regime  and  how  we  can  create  truly  open networks, with easier access for competitors and more transparent pricing.

 A  more  efficient,  competitive  and  innovative  telecommunications  sector  will unleash  significant  cost  reductions  and  productivity  gains  throughout  the economy, spark innovation and deliver new services to everyone.

 These are the real priorities for Australian telecommunications policy.

 Modernizing social policy

 Modernizing economic policy is inseparable from modernizing social policy.

 Last  weekend  the  news  pages  of  The  Australian  carried  a  story  that challenges us all to rethink our approach to these areas.

 It  contained  the  findings  of  a  paper  prepared  by  the  London  School  of Economics that measured the social mobility of people in Britain over the last five decades.

 It demonstrated that the Thatcherite small-government-at-all-costs agenda of the 1980s and 1990s has resulted in a decline of social mobility in the United Kingdom.

 Its  warning  was  that  if  we  prevent  high-ability  children  from  low  income families from achieving better education outcomes inequality will increase and national productivity will decline.

 The findings of this paper have obvious relevance to Australian social policy.

 Research  from  many  quarters  is  showing  that  three  quarters  of  a  million Australian  children  are  being  brought  up  in  poverty  -  up  by  116,000  under John Howard.

 University of Melbourne researcher Richard Teese has warned us that the gap in educational attainment between affluent and poor suburbs is widening and

 10

 that there is a significant correlation between suburbs of early school leaving, child poverty and high unemployment.

 We  are  in  danger  of  raising  the  next  generation  in  poverty  and  cutting  our potential productivity and wealth.

 Tax Reform

 One  of  the  most  crucial  policy  instruments  in  advancing  a  strong  economy and a just society is tax policy.

 After all, this government is the highest taxing government in history.

 Labor wants to ease the burden on Australian families living under financial pressure.

 Participants in this conference would be well aware of Labor's long-standing and consistent support for tax credits.

 I  couldn't  tell  you  the  Howard  government's  position  on  tax  credits  without first checking the alignment of the planets: John Howard hates them, Peter Costello doesn't know, and Tony Abbott supports them on Mondays, but not on Tuesdays.  His last intervention into Peter Costello's portfolio to advocate tax credits got front-page coverage - again - but again was repudiated by a spokesperson exactly a day later.

 Tax credits are, in effect, a negative income tax.  What they do is give you something  back  from  the  tax  you  pay  as  a  way  of  the  Government  helping you with the costs of living and raising a family.  The best models take into account your income, the number of people in your family and the interaction of the tax and social security systems.

 This  makes  tax  credits  a  good  way  of  targeting  relief  to  those  who  need  it most, and an excellent way of addressing the crucial issue of the living wage.

 As  we  sit  here  today,  too  many  working  Australians  are  poor.   It  is  a  new phenomenon and it is about time we addressed it.

 Why is the living wage important?

 It is important because economic growth isn’t producing prosperity the way it used to.  For a start, it’s producing fewer jobs:

 â¢ Average annual employment growth under the six years of the Howard Government  has  been  1.8%  --  lower  than  the  average  under  13  years  of Labor Government -- even including a global recession -- of 2.2%.

 And it’s producing lower-paid jobs:

 11

 â¢ Recent  ABS  statistics  reveal  the  astonishing  information  that  the Howard Government has created just 600 new middle-income jobs over the last 3 years.  Every other new job it has created has been a low-pay job.

 It used to be that your job was your ticket to the Australian dream: a house, a car, a decent education for your kids.  You need to be walking around with your  eyes  shut  today  not  to  see  that  for  too  many  working  Australians  the dream is over.

 The  recent  living  wage  case  has  made  us  all  aware  again  how  working Australians struggle to put food on the table and struggle even to qualify for a mortgage and that first step on the ladder to home ownership.

 If people agree that growing prosperity means that people should not be left behind then we have to ensure that we create decent minimum wages.  My view is that this can’t be achieved by lifting the minimum wage alone.

 We are about to have another federal budget.  Budgets are about choices.

 If  we  achieve  government  in  2004  we  could  be  looking  on  a  conservative estimate  at  around  6  billion  dollars  accruing  every  year  in  bracket  creep between  now  and  the  end  of  the  first  term  of  a  Labor  Government.   That opens up a lot of choice.  We should start thinking now about those choices for handing back that bracket creep.

 Tied  to  delivering  a  living  wage  in  conjunction  with  pay  rises,  tax  credits would be a smart tax cut, not a lazy one.  They narrow the gap between rich and poor, involve a lower cost to the employer, boost employment and boost incentive.

 They can also help with horizontal equity.  By this I mean they recognize the higher costs families face in raising children, in particular the rising costs of educating their kids.  Tax credits could be used constructively in this regard too.

 If  tax  credit  payments  were  made  at  the  beginning  of  the  school  year  they can make it easier for families to meet educational expenses such as books, clothes and excursions, whether children are enrolled in government or non-government schools. So tax credits can be good knowledge economy policies also.

 In Labor’s last period in office, the Accord represented sound incomes policy. But our approach to this needs modernization.  Tax credits can lift the living wage without all of the bill going to business.  They help those in work while generating economic incentives for the unemployed.

 12

 My  message  today  is  that  tax  credits  will  be  part  of  Labor's  policy  review. Labor  will  continue  to  develop  our  consistent  support  for  tax  credits  as  a means of advancing Australia as a strong economy and a just society.

 Conclusion

 If I can sum up my message today in a single line is that I believe in tackling inequality by modernizing the economy.  In creating a strong economy and a just society.

 It’s a Labor way, but a modern Labor way.

 Modern Labor means a modern Australia.

 Ends.
