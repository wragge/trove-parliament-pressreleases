 Gove and Groote join Customs national waterfront CCTV network   

 Gove and Groote Eylandt will join Darwin as Territory ports connected to Customs national  waterfront closed circuit TV network, Senator Nigel Scullion said today.   

 Under new measures announced by the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for  Justice and Customs today, activities at the ports will be monitored by Customs around the clock  without the need for a physical presence, significantly increasing border security.   

 Territory CLP Senator Scullion said that the funding announced today, $17 million over four years,  would allow the number of ports covered by the network to be expanded to 63.   

 This represents a virtual doubling of Customs ability to remotely monitor border activity at  Australian ports 24-hours a day, 365-days of the year. Automated video motion detection makes  sure that activity on the waterfront, no matter what time of the day or night, can be targeted and  monitored.   

 “This greatly enhanced surveillance network will provide comprehensive monitoring of Australia’s  waterfront and deliver enhanced security to the Port of Melville Bay at Gove and Port of Milner  Bay at Groote Eylandt,” Senator Scullion said.   

 “The Territory will also get an additional Customs officer based at Nhulunbuy under the plans  announced today.   

 “Australia has a vast coastline with many ports and protecting our borders is a huge task. To tackle  this challenge, Customs has already connected 32 ports including the Port of Darwin to its  waterfront CCTV network,” he said.   

 The present existing national network consists of more than 220 cameras at 95 wharf areas.  All the  cameras are linked to local Customs Houses, Regional Monitoring Centres in each state, and the  National Monitoring Centre in Melbourne.   

 “Customs is Australia’s key frontline border protection agency and this new funding will enable  them to provide an even higher level of protection for Australia against illicit drugs, illegal arrivals,  disease and other threats to the nation’s welfare.”   

 In addition, an increase in operating hours at container examination facilities across Australia will  allow Customs to boost the number of containers x-rayed from 80,000 to 100,000 per year.  All  containers are screened by Customs before arrival in Australia, and Australia’s x-ray inspection rate  of 7 per cent of sea cargo imports means we are a world leader, putting us right up there with the  US and ahead of other countries.   

 “The new funding will also enable Customs to board 80 per cent of shipping at first ports of arrival.   

 Customs Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) system is acknowledged as a world leader in its field.

 “No other country has achieved the coverage Australia has through the linking of all of its major  international sea ports,” Senator Scullion said.   

 “This solid commitment to border protection shows that the Howard Government will not rest in  ensuring that Australia’s borders are secure and protected against illegal activity and the threat of  terrorism,” he said.
