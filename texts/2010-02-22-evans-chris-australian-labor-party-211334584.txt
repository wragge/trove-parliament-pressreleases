 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Liberal Party ignores its own record on boat  arrivals  Monday, 22 February 2010 

 The Liberal Party's latest claims on boat arrivals rely on selective data and ignore the  truth of its own record. 

 The highest number of boat arrivals on record came under John Howard's Liberal  Government in 2001, when 5516 people arrived in 43 boats. The months of August  and September 2001 saw more than 2200 people arrive in just 10 boats. 

 The second highest number of boat arrivals was also under John Howard's Liberal  government when 3721 people arrived in 86 boats throughout 1999. The months of  November and December 1999 saw 24 boats arrive carrying almost 2000 people. 

 The third highest number of boats was also under John Howard's Liberal  government when 2939 people arrived in 51 boats throughout 2000. 

 At the time of the 1999 surge, former Liberal immigration minister Philip Ruddock  stated on 14 November 1999: 

 "It is timely to remember that the use of people smugglers to get around a country's  rules about who can come and who can stay is a worldwide problem. Australia is not  alone. We are also seeing large numbers of people seeking asylum in developed  countries - people from the same groups as we are seeing in Australia. For  example, Iraqi asylum-seekers are registered in 77 countries and last year there  were over 34 000 applications for asylum lodged by Iraqis in 19 European countries." 

 Last week, Mr Ruddock's understudy, Opposition immigration spokesman Scott  Morrison, suggested that Australia alone was experiencing a rise in asylum claims in  2009. 

 Again, the Liberal Party was being deceitful with figures. The United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not yet published its final figures for  asylum applications in 2009. 

 On the data that are available, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,  Germany, Norway and Poland experienced significant increases in 2009. In fact,  asylum claims in France alone rose by 6800 to almost 42 000. 

 It is worth noting that the number of asylum claims in Australia last year was less  than half than in 2000 and 2001 under the Howard government, when more than 12  000 claims were lodged in each of those years. 

 The Liberal Party is in denial about the conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka which  have seen tens of thousands of people flee for safety, in the same vein that tens of  thousands of people fled Iraq and Afghanistan in the Howard era.
