  Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 

 Immigration Litigation at Record Levels  MPS 6/2003 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous  Affairs, Philip Ruddock has today expressed concern about litigation  in the immigration portfolio, with the number of active cases at  record levels. 

 As at 24 January, there were 2,250 cases before the courts or the  AAT, compared with just 1,000 active cases in April 2001. More  than half, or 1,336 current cases involve asylum matters,  underscoring concern about abuse of the system. 

 There has been a 400% increase in the number of applications  lodged with the courts and the AAT over the past seven years  (1994-95 to 2001-02). In 1994-95 only 513 cases were lodged; in  2001-02 it had increased to 2,609. 

 'Immigration litigation before the courts continues to grow  alarmingly and the backlog is increasing,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 On current trends, applications will increase to over 3,800 this  financial year. 

 Applicants are rarely successful. Of the 1,904 cases resolved before  the courts during 2001-02 only 111 applicants won their cases.  However in many instances, the object was to obtain a delay in  departure from Australia. 

 As the caseload grows, the only result is further delays in cases  being resolved, some applicants spending more time in detention  and an increased burden on taxpayers. 

 The cost for each case is around $10,000, so my Department is  facing a litigation bill in excess of $20 million this year. The total  cost to the community is much higher with the expense of running  courts and jobs lost to litigants who remain here. 

 The introduction in 2001 of a new judicial review scheme and new  case management practices attempted to address this issue. 

 Steps have been taken so that cases filed in the Federal Court or  Federal Magistrates Court are dealt with as expeditiously as  possible. 

 The majority of cases should not be coming before the courts.  Applicants and their representatives need to realistically assess their  chances of successfully overturning decisions early in the process. 

 'They owe it themselves and the community to refrain from cynically  using the legal system just to delay the inevitable,' Mr Ruddock  said.
