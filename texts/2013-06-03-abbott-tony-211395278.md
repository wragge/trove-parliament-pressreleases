 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Over the weekend, we reached another dreadful milestone in the degradation of our border security. There  have now been 702 illegal boats arrive on our shores since the current government watered down the border  protection policies that the Howard Government put in place. We’ve had almost 43,000 illegal arrivals by  boat. This is a massive failure on the part of the Government. You could almost fill the Sydney Football  Stadium with the number of people who have arrived illegally by boat and the Government, I regret to say,  has simply surrendered in the face of the people smugglers. They have no plan other than to essentially put  out the welcome mat and this is a tragedy for our country. It’s a tragedy for the people who will drown at sea  while this dreadful trade continues.    

 So, I want to say to the people of Australia that things will be different under a Coalition government. They  will be different from day one. We’ve stopped the boats before, we will stop the boats again and we’ll do it  by temporary protection visas, which will deny the people smugglers a product to sell; rigorous offshore  processing; the willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so; and building a much better and  much stronger relationship with Indonesia, which is the country through which the overwhelming majority  of illegal boat arrivals transit.   

 I am very proud of the work that Scott Morrison has been doing in this area for the last few years and I  might ask Scott to add to my remarks.   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 This latest vessel had 207 people on board. This is the second largest vessel to turn up under this  government, under their watch. It comes on the back of record months in May and April and March in  succession now with boats arriving at over 3,000 per month.    

 I just want to update also on the issue I raised last Friday and that is this government’s light touch on our  borders is matched by their light touch on security, national security, when it comes to immigration issues.  Over the weekend the Minister has so far declined to conduct an independent inquiry into this matter  involving the convicted jihadist terrorist who was held in a low security family accommodation facility in  South Australia for five months.  

 Today I will be writing to the independents, setting out a proposed terms of reference for a House select  committee to conduct that parliamentary inquiry, given that the Government has refused to put in place an  independent inquiry and wants to continue to cover up what is effectively another Captain Emad debacle on  this government’s watch. So, I’ll be writing to the independents today. The Government’s light touch on our  borders is matched by their light touch when it comes to national security.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott are you prepared to defy the Indonesian Government to turn boats back there even though their  Ambassador on Friday made it clear that they don’t want to accept them?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, we’re very confident that we can have a strong and constructive relationship with the Indonesian  Government. I’ve had several meetings with the President. I’ve met with Foreign Minister Natalegawa. I  have a good and strong relationship with Ambassador Nadjib. Julie Bishop obviously spends an enormous  amount of time working with the Indonesians, as does Scott Morrison. So, we are very confident that an  incoming Coalition government won’t repeat the kind of mistakes that we’ve seen from the current  government, of which the absolute worst was the suspension of the live cattle trade in a state of panic over a  TV programme.   

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible] the willingness to turn boats around now. Is that different to the reality of turning boats around?  Will you actually turn around any boats?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The Howard Government turned boats around. It wasn’t a large number, but it was enough to send an  absolutely crystal clear signal to the people smugglers and their clients that the game was up and that the  Australian Government and people would no longer be played for mugs.   

 QUESTION:   

 How long do you think it will take to stop the boats?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We will make a difference from day one. From day one we will make a difference and obviously we will be  judged on our results, should we win this election, at the subsequent one.    

 QUESTION:   

 Would the issue of a republic ever get any air time if you’re Prime Minister after September?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 As far as I’m concerned, the only referendum that counts is the referendum on September the 14th on a very  bad government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Morrison, can I just ask you, were you pleased to see that the Immigration Minister gave some sort of  qualified support to your plan for a work for the dole-style scheme for asylum seekers living here?   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Well, I think it’s very late in coming. I mean, this government has had this problem on their hands for some  time. I’m surprised if they were interested in an idea like this that they haven’t moved on it sooner. It has  been Coalition policy to have work for the dole and mutual obligation mandatory for those on temporary  protection visas and on bridging visas since those bridging visas were introduced. So, that’s a matter for the  Government whether they take it up. It’s very late in the day for them to be converted to Coalition ideas, but  we welcome at any time that they would do it.   

 QUESTION:   

 On the Egyptian case, there was documentation provided by a refugee advocate to Lateline on Friday night  that discredited some of the AFP’s evidence. Do you regret some of the language you’ve been using in your  press releases to describe this person without knowing the full details of his case?   

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 No I don’t. No I don’t, because what is on the record is an Interpol Red Notice for a convicted jihadist  terrorist. Now, if this individual has claims to make about that matter then they should make those claims  through the proper process, but what the Government shouldn’t do is give a convicted terrorist the benefit of  the doubt and put them in a low-security family accommodation facility while those matters are potentially  unresolved. I mean, the Government has to deal with the facts that are before them and the facts that are  before this Government is they have a convicted jihadist terrorist in a low-security family accommodation  facility for five months knowing full well of those convictions right next to a Defence facility in South  Australia. That’s the issue here. The issue here is that the Government has put someone that they know as  advised by ASIO and the AFP to be convicted terrorist. Now, processes follow but you don’t go and give  someone like that the benefit of the doubt as this Government has which demonstrates that they’re a light  touch.    

 It strikes me that this Government, frankly, is more interested in protecting the interests of unions, as we’ve  seen in this latest business regarding 457s, than they are in protecting our national security or protecting our  borders.    

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible] the DisabilityCare headquarters is going to be set up in Geelong?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, we put this on the table some weeks ago. Obviously, the people of Geelong have been through a lot  lately. There’s the impending Ford closure, there’s the risks to Shell and to Alcoa, so look, there’s a sense in  which the Government is playing catch-up here but obviously I support the sensible location of facilities in  regional areas where it may help those regions and contribute to good public administration.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, we’ve just had word that the lead singer of Yothu Yindi, Mandawuy Yunupingu, has passed  away. How much of an icon do you think he was?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, he was a great leader of his people. He was obviously a very significant cultural figure to the wider  Australian community as well as amongst Aboriginal people and it’s tragic that he’s gone and I guess it’s  very sad that he’s gone at such an early age, but this is one of the real problems in modern Australia - too  many Aboriginal people die too young.  

 

 QUESTION:    

 On the asbestos and NBN matter, who do you think is ultimately is to blame?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 This is another problem with a rollout which has proven to be embarrassingly slow and embarrassingly  expensive. Now, on top of all the other problems with the National Broadband Network, this is something  that the Government just doesn’t need. Now, I call on the Government to come clean with the Australian  people and to tell us exactly how many instances there have been of potential asbestos exposure and what it  is going to do in the future to ensure that the National Broadband Network rollout does not expose families,  communities and workers to this kind of extremely hazardous material.    

 Thank you.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, are you still a monarchist?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Yep.
