 VANSTONE’S EFFORT TO MISREPRESENT ON  CHILDREN IN DETENTION   

 

 

 Over the weekend Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone has tried to  pretend there are only 15 children in detention centres.   

 This attempt at misrepresentation seeks to disguise the fact that the Howard Government  has responsibility for approximately 110 children in onshore and off shore detention  centres, who have sought or attempted to seek asylum from Australia.   

 Minister Vanstone’s effort to misrepresent the situation stems from her attempt to spin  Christmas Island and Nauru out of existence.   

 As the Department of Immigration’s own situation report of 11 February 2004 shows,  there are 8 children at Baxter Immigration Detention Centre, 4 children at Port Hedland  Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC), and 15 children at Christmas  Island IRPC (figures attached).   

 In addition to these 27 children, there are 83 children in Nauru, for whom Senator  Vanstone continues to pretend Australia has no responsibility for.   

 Prime Minister Howard and Minister Vanstone should adopt Labor’s positive approach to  no children in detention and ending the ‘Pacific Solution’.
