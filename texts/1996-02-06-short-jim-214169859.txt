 Senator Jim Short Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs  & Assisting the Leader on Multicultural Affairs

 ÎÎÎÎ 9/96

 S H A M E L E SS L A B O R ’S L A T E ST  LIES

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Uolkus, has been running a  shameless and immoral scares and lies campaign against the Coalition in the ethnic communities.

 Jt is immoral and heartless for the Minister to callously manipulates the ethnic communities in this  way. llis scares and lies campaign is directed at some of Australia’s most vulnerable people, those  from non-English speaking background, and is the last resort of a tired and desperate government  which is totally devoid of new ideas and initiatives

 In its latest round of lies Labor has claimed that: “a Coalition Government:

 â¢ 11-/7/ stop migration LIE. On the contrary we will maintain an ongoing positive immigration  program which has broad community support, and is suited to Australia's national interests and  international responsibilities. Wc also will maintain the immigration intake at around its current  levels, without any significant variation.

 â¢ will abolish the Department o f Immigration and Ethnic Affairs LIE, The only government to  ever abolish the department was the Whitlatn Labor Government. The Eraser Coalition  Government reinstated the department in 1976, and the Coalition has supported its retention  ever since. We will noi abolish the department.

 â¢ will cut fam ily re-union migration FALSE. Our policy states that family reunion and  refugee/humanitarian immigration will remain central parts of the immigration program.

 â¢ if/// reverse the decision granting permanent residence to certain Chinese students"·· LIE, The  Coalition will not be taking away the permanent residency of the Chinese students - or anyone  else.

 â¢ will introduce psychological tests for applicants fa r migration to Australia ”- LIE. The  Coalition will not be doing this

 â¢ will stop A ;ian immigration''- LIE. The Coalition will vigorously maintain its longstanding  commitment to non-discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, or  religion.

 â¢ has no concern with stamping out racism FALSE. The basic cause of racism is ignorance.  Education is the only lasting visblc way to eradicate racism. The Coalition will introduce a $10  million 2 year multi-pronged education campaign to achieve this end.

 â¢ "will fu n d  Us policy through the sale o f Telstra FALSE. And absurd.

 â¢ 'does not believe in the advancement o f multiculturalism ” - LIE Many of the current  multicultural programs were set up under Liberal Governments (eg SBS, migrant resource  centres, grant-in-aid workers, ESL). The Coalition has consistently supported the principles set  down in The National Agenda fo r  a Multicultural Australia, 1989 and has consistently  advocated policies which advance multiculturalism for the betterment of all Australians.

 â¢ “does not take an interest in this important portfolio “ - LIE. Senator Short spends the majority  of his time consulting with Australia’s many diverse ethnic communities. This grass roots  consultation has laid the foundations for the Coalition’s policy platforms, and will continue in  Government. This is in direct contrast to Labor which, through Senator Bolkus, only consults  with special interest groups, and would rather spend its time on stage managed, tax-payer  funded, gala performances than rolling up his sleeves with the communities at a grass-roots  level.

 The Australian electorate should never forget that this Labor Government will say and do anything  to get rc-elcctcd No lie is too fanciful. No community is too vulnerable. No personal slur is too  insulting.

 Labor has no shame.
