 Barnett Calls For More Overseas Students, Business Migrants And Refugees In  Tasmania 

 Saturday, 17 May 2003 

 Tasmania is playing its part in the humanitarian effort to settle refugees in Australia,  Senator Guy Barnett said today.   

 “In the five years to June 30 last year there were 626 settlers accepted for  humanitarian reasons into Tasmania, while in the current financial year a further 380  refugees and humanitarian entrants are being settled in the State, or more than half the  total for the past five years,” Senator Barnett said.   

 “The current intake is a six-fold increase on the numbers in 1999-2000 and shows that  we do care,” he said.   

 Nationally the intake for this financial year is 12,000 new places. Over the past 50  years 600,000 refugees and displaced people have been settled in Australia.   

 Refugee settlers in Tasmania had come from countries such as Sudan, Bosnia and  Ethiopia.   

 However, Senator Barnett said that apart from the good news on the refugee question,  the Tasmanian community should work to attract a greater share of new migrant  settlers from overseas to the State, and tap into their skills, and the social and financial  wealth they would bring with them.   

 “Every year about 110,000 overseas born people settle in Australia, and NSW takes  four out of every 10.   

 “Tasmania takes less than 1000 each year, but on a population share basis the total  ought to be at least 3000 annually. We should be emulating our performance on the  refugee intake where we settle more than our population share,” he said.   

 Hopefully this can be rectified. In March this year the Tasmanian Settlement Plan was  launched. This plan, drawn up by local community and government representatives is  helping to develop better opportunities for people settling in Tasmania.   

 Senator Barnett congratulated the Tasmanian Government for co-operating with the  Federal Government’s new guidelines for business migration into the State.   

 Under the changes to business skills visa arrangements, the States and territories will  have more influence over the number of entrants and where they settle, by being able  to sponsor business migrants.   

 The guidelines include a four-year provisional visa, leading to permanent residency  on application, once the person has operated a business successfully for two years  under State sponsorship. 

 

 On overseas student visas Senator Barnett said he was happy to work with the State  Government to increase the intake in Tasmania, now that record numbers (151,894  students in 2001-02) were being allowed to study in Australia.   

 “This scheme offers a much needed income source for our secondary and tertiary  institutions, while promoting understanding of lifestyles and cultures of our northern  neighbours,” Senator Barnett said.   

 He urged Tasmania to get on the ground floor to benefit from a range of Budget  initiatives announced this week by Education Minister Dr Brendan Nelson, in a multi-million package aimed at attracting more overseas students to study in Tasmania.   

 “Tasmania is continuing to attract greater numbers of overseas students for temporary  study, because of our quality education and safe and comfortable life style,” Senator  Barnett said.
