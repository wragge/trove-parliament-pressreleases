 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP TO SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LABOR CONFERENCE SATURDAY

 13th APRIL 2002

 This is the first state conference I’ve had the chance to address since becoming Leader five months ago.

 I want to congratulate Mike Rann and his team for their magnificent win.

 And I want to say thanks to the branch members for campaigning their hearts out to make John Howard’s wost nightmare come true - Labor governments in every state and territory.

 Thanks to you, you can now drive right around Highway One and take the ferry to Tasmania without leaving Labor soil.

 John Howard sees this arrangement as a threat.  I see it as an opportunity. An opportunity to create a new federalism to build a stronger nation.

 The first Shadow Cabinet meeting held after your state election was held here in South Australia.  We released a plan to combat salinity and examined how we can stop the buck passing holding back our schools and hospitals.

 The Australian people don’t want conflict.

 They want action, agreement and solutions.

 By holding that Shadow Cabinet meeting in South Australia I wanted to demonstrate that by working together, state and federal Labor can come up with a constructive partnership to get this great state moving again.

 It’s an opportunity that can only be realized if Labor succeeds nationally.

 So there’s one more challenge for us to meet - that’s forming government nationally as well.

 2

 The Labor Party can and will win in 2004, but only if we have the courage to reform ourselves and renew our policies.

 We have a proud history but we’ve also got to show that we are a party of the future, for the future.

 Let’s not kid ourselves that millions of Australians lie awake at night, tossing and turning, worrying about the structure of the ALP.

 But there are many for whom our internal affairs symbolize wider and more important perceptions:

 â¢ Whether we have courage to stand up for what’s right and take on those who break the rules; â¢ Whether we can change with the times; and â¢ Whether we have ideas that can make people’s lives better.

 If they see we’ve got the courage to do these things they’ll know we have the strength to run the country.

 I’ve established two reviews to come up with the changes we need.

 The first under Bob Hawke and Neville Wran will modernize our structures.

 The second, under Jenny Macklin, will modernize our policies.

 I don’t propose to pre-empt the outcomes of these reviews.

 As a first step in the renewal of Labor’s democracy, these reviews will be open and thorough.

 Every view will be listened to and considered, whether they’re arguing for radical change or no change at all.

 Whether they’re arguing for modernization or a return to old policies.

 So I urge you to pick up your pen or go to our website and give us your views.

 But I want to let you know where I stand.

 I’m a modernizer.

 I want to modernize the Labor Party so I can modernize Australia.

 Enforcing the rules

 The National Executive has established a Committee of Review to examine ways to improve key aspects of the Party’s performance.

 3

 The Review will examine ways to ensure that we preselect the best possible candidates.

 It will examine how we can get better input from members into the policy review.

 It will examine the relationships between the Party, trade unions and other important community groups.

 It will recommend strategies to increase our primary vote at federal elections.

 It will look at how we can increase Party membership and the involvement of members in our activities.

 And the Review will also examine the Party’s internal processes.

 This brings me to the first challenge we must meet: demonstrating to the Australian people that we’ve got the courage to stand up for what’s right.

 The Australian people have watched with increasing disgust, how they were lied to by this Government at the last election.

 They know that the truth went overboard and the children didn’t.

 They know that John Howard knew that the evidence against Justice Kirby was false.

 Some think the Australian people don’t care as long as the Government keeps giving them what they want.

 I disagree.

 I think Australians want to be governed by people who are honest and decent.

 They don’t like being lied to, especially during an election campaign.

 We must reflect these Australian values in the way we run our own Party.

 Many people are put off by the way we make decisions.  To outsiders it looks ugly.  We must make ourselves more open and accountable.

 Some may say that the changes being considered are in some ways an attack on the Party and its traditions.

 Nothing could be further from the truth.

 It’s the people who abuse the Party’s processes for their own gain who are the ones attacking the Party.

 4

 We need to stand up for what’s right, protect the Party’s processes and defend the democratic rights of ordinary members from the abuse of branch stackers and others.

 The factions must be made to work for the Party, not the other way round.

 Lets show the Australian people that we’ve got the courage to stand up for what’s right by cleaning up our own act.

 One of the things all Australians believe in is playing by the rules.

 But for too long some have been able to break our rules with impunity.

 Those days are over.

 We must not reward branch stackers, but reward quality candidates.

 Candidates who do more than carry the Labor banner.  They’ve got to be champions of their communities and champions of new ideas.

 The way to get more of these people into Parliament is to start by making Labor Party membership more attractive.

 Lots of good ideas have been proposed to the Hawke-Wran Review so far.

 We need to expand the ways people can participate.

 We need to consider new branch structures.

 We must make the National Conference more interesting and dynamic.

 But I think most of all, we must make Party membership more meaningful by democratizing our processes from top to bottom.

 Every member who pays his or her membership fees must have an equal say.

 We must make it easier to join and easier to participate.

 And we must build further integrity into the membership lists if we’re to effectively counter the branch stackers.

 Let me state one change I’d like to see: being on the electoral roll must be the basis of a member’s right to vote in Party preselections.

 We need to make arrangements for people who are not on the roll for valid reasons, like people under 18 years of age.

 But the general principle should be that if you can’t vote Labor in a state or federal election, you shouldn’t be able to choose a Labor candidate.

 5

 Peter Beattie and I adopted this principle - of using the standards adopted by the Australian Electoral Commission to verify membership - to get a better model of affiliation of unions in the Queensland Branch.

 It’s a sensible solution that worked there and we should use it again.

 Policies for making people’s lives better

 Ultimately every change we make to the Labor Party must demonstrate that we’ve got what it takes to make people’s lives better.

 One thing is for sure about modernizing the Labor Party: it doesn’t mean abandoning Labor principles.

 Labor’s principles provide us with the policies people want.

 â¢ Providing opportunities for everyone. â¢ Building strong, well-run public services. â¢ Making life easier for families under financial pressure. â¢ Developing the nation’s knowledge and skills. â¢ Creating jobs and tackling the scourge of unemployment. â¢ Ensuring our future is sustainable. â¢ Being an active and responsible international citizen.

 Put together they mean this - the creation of a strong economy and just society.

 It’s only through a strong economy that jobs and opportunities can be created and shared.

 We must turn our principles into new policies that have relevance for people’s lives.

 There’s something I want to stress: I don’t want us to modernize to become more conservative.

 Far from it.

 I want us to modernize to make our core values new again.

 I want us to propose big changes.  Bold changes that will have real impact.

 Changes that will give people a real choice.

 Let me tell you how we’ve made a start.

 Since the election I’ve announced a number of policies.

 6

 In January, I announced that we would ensure a proper balance between border protection and compassion for genuine refugees.

 No matter what the rights and wrongs of their parent’s case, it’s just plain wrong to keep children behind razor wire.

 You don’t need to lie or lock up children to protect your borders.

 That’s why I announced that Labor would get the children out from behind the razor wire by allowing them and their mothers to live under supervision in ordinary-style accommodation.

 I announced also that Labor would mothball Woomera; return security arrangements at detention centres to the Commonwealth; separate ordinary detainees from hard-core troublemakers; and speed up the processing of detainees.

 I’ve also led the way by calling for a proper time-limited safe haven arrangement for people from the war-torn country of Afghanistan.

 Since then the Government has announced the wind down of Woomera, the separation of detainees within camps, and plans to get some children out of detention centres.

 Sound familiar?  All Labor policy.  We lead, they follow.

 I’ve called for a national population policy to grow the economies of our regions, including Tasmania and this great state of South Australia, in a sustainable way.

 We need to take the population pressure off Melbourne and Sydney and bring people and jobs back to the rest of Australia.

 If we explain the benefits of a larger population, we can build public support for immigration and for policies to make it easier for people to choose to have children.

 I’ve called for the modernization of the Parliament to have a truly independent Speaker, a Question Time where the Government has to answer questions, and rules to stop former ministers getting high-paid jobs in companies dealing with their recent ministerial portfolios.

 I’ve proposed four-year terms for the federal parliament, so governments can implement long-term policy agendas for the future of the country.

 I’ve proposed a five-point plan to keep petrol prices down, including specific penalties and sanctions for price exploitation during holiday periods.

 7

 I’ve called for cheaper and better phone and Internet services through more competition and a majority publicly owned Telstra.

 And I’ve already commenced discussions with the state premiers on the new federalism we need to end the buck passing on health, education and the environment.

 We’ve announced all these new directions in just five months.

 Meanwhile, the Government has no third-term agenda and no substance. It’s mired in scandal after scandal.  Going nowhere.

 We will continue to set the agenda.

 Last week I signalled that Labor would re-examine the issue of raising incomes for ordinary Australians - including the working poor - through tax credits.

 Everyone  here  would be  well  aware  of  Labor's  long-standing and consistent support for tax credits.

 I  couldn't  tell  you  the  Howard  government's  position  on  tax  credits  without first checking the alignment of the planets: John Howard hates them, Peter Costello doesn't know, and Tony Abbott supports them on Mondays, but not on Tuesdays.  His last intervention into Peter Costello's portfolio to advocate tax credits got front-page coverage - again - but again was repudiated by a spokesperson exactly a day later.

 Labor’s tax credits are also a new jobs plan and a new plan for a living wage.

 These types of policies have been a success overseas in countries like Britain, the United States and Ireland.

 They can work here too.

 In the next six years there will be an average of $6 billion per year in bracket creep, meaning that ordinary Australians will be paying more and more income tax.

 We’ve already got the highest taxing government of all time, so we need to give that money back and there will be many options for us to consider.

 Peter - Casino - Costello has come out and bagged our proposal saying that the money isn’t there.

 Well, we know why he thinks some of it isn’t there: because he put $4.8 billion of it on black on the roulette wheel - and lost.

 8

 He’s the Gambler, the Kenny Rodgers of Australian politics, who now wants to hide how much bracket creep he’s taking from you.

 I’ve got some gambling advice for you Peter: “you gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em, know when to walk away, and know when to run.”

 We know that the Coalition always give the greatest tax cut to the wealthy few.

 We want to give it to working families to help them cope with the costs of bringing up children, and to boost the incomes of the lowest paid.

 The recent wage case has reminded us all of the struggles that some low paid people have just to pay the rent and the bills and put food on the table.

 Through our proposal, we could give a working family an income boost that wouldn’t cost them other benefits they need.

 In fact, for a family with two kids and one full-time breadwinner on the minimum wage, a $10 tax credit is the same as a $15 pay rise before tax.

 And if the same family has a second breadwinner on the full-time minimum wage, a $10 tax credit is the same as a $25 pay rise, because you don’t lose any in tax or in family payment claw back.

 The ACTU is fighting hard for decent minimum wages for Australian workers. This proposal would bridge the gap between the $25 workers want and the $10 the Government wants to beat them down to.  It would strengthen that fight for a living wage and give some real tax relief to struggling working families.

 And if we pay these extra benefits at the start of the school year, we can make it easier for every family to meet the rising costs of educating their children.

 These policies are a smart tax cut not a lazy one.

 They narrow the gap between rich and poor, help create a knowledge society, involve a lower cost to the employer, boost employment and boost incentive.

 We’ve seen the latest unemployment figures.  Unemployment is down, but it’s still far too high.

 We want to see the Government come clean on its promise of a 5 percent unemployment rate.

 Our new jobs plan will make that easier.

 9

 Until now these types of policies have been called tax credits.  I prefer to think of them as a real pay rise for working families and a new plan to create jobs.

 They’re a way to spread the benefits of growth to everyone.  They’re the best way to start building a strong economy and a just society.

 This is a Labor way, but a modern Labor way.

 Changing with the times

 New policies such as our real pay rise for working families show how new policies can give new life to our traditional principles.

 They show how we can think of new and more ambitious ways than we’ve seen in a generation to help working people.

 They also demonstrate how as our relationship with the union movement is modernized, our commitment to working people will never change.

 I can’t imagine a Labor Party that doesn’t have strong links with the union movement.  We both exist to represent working people.  And that will never change.

 But we have to acknowledge that the workforce has changed and that as a result, we must change too.

 We can’t modernize the country until we modernize ourselves.

 In the last six years alone there have been enormous changes in the structure of the workforce.

 Here’s the extent of change:

 â¢ In 1995, almost 40 percent of the Australian workforce were employed in  the  predominantly  blue-collar  and  highly  unionized  industries  of agriculture,  forestry,  fishing,  mining,  manufacturing,  power, construction, wholesale trade and transport.  Last year that figure fell to 35 percent.

 â¢ In  1995,  there  were  1.65  million  casual  employees  in  the  workforce. Today  the  figure  is  more  than  2.1  million.   We  know  that  casual workers are far less likely to be unionized than permanent ones.

 â¢ Since 1995, the number of self-employed people in the usually heavily unionized construction industry has increased by 26 percent.

 â¢ In 1995, 35 percent of the workforce were members of trade unions. Today that figure stands at 24.5 percent.

 10

 And  lets  not  forget  that  many  of  the  non-unionized  are  the  low-paid.   We must better represent them and that’s a commitment we share with the trade unions.

 Trade unions play a vital  role for their members and provide a  strong voice for fairness in the workplace.

 Working  Australians  recognize  that  trade  unions  often  stand  between  them and second-best pay and conditions.

 Clearly,  modernization  is  needed  if  the  Labor  Party  is  going  to  continue  to represent a broad cross section of society and a majority of working people.

 But it is not an attack on the legitimate and important part trade unions play in  the  economy  and  society  to  say  it  is  time  to  look  at  the  relationship between the unions and the Party.

 Links with the union movement will remain strong.

 In fact, I think we can make them even stronger by attracting more unionists to join the Labor Party as individual members.

 But  we  must  complement  them  with  greater  connections  to  and  better relations with small businesspeople, the self-employed and young people.

 People want to know whether Labor can change with the times.  By modernizing our link with the unions we can demonstrate that we can and will.

 Conclusion

 The election loss last November was a disappointment.

 But we accept the voters’ verdict.

 The people have told us to rethink, reform and rebuild.

 To come back next time with a new team and a new agenda for the nation.

 An agenda that gives people a real choice and will make a real difference to them and the country.

 Lets show them that we have got the courage to meet this challenge.

 That we can modernize our party.

 That we can attract new talent.

 11

 That we can develop new policies based on traditional Labor values.

 Lets respond by coming back and winning in 2004.

 As proud as we are of our past, we’re the party of the future.

 Ends.
