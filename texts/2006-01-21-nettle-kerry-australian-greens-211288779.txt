 In the wake of recent shootings that have killed four people in West Papua, Australian  Government officials have a moral obligation to allow the 43 West Papuans currently being held in Immigration detention on Christmas Island to contact their families, Australian Greens Senator  Kerry Nettle said today.    

 The Australian Government is denying the 43 West Papuan detainees access to the outside world,  so these people may not be aware of the tragedy that has occurred in their homeland, Senator  Nettle said.    

 "I have received reports from Christmas Island that local residents and West Timorese detainees  are being prevented from talking to the recently arrived West Papuan asylum seekers."    

 "These are the families that Senator Vanstone said would be living in the community. The  Government must not hold these people incommunicado especially when family members have  just been killed by the Indonesian military in West Papua.    

 "I will be flying to Christmas Island in the next few days and if the detainees are still on the island  I plan to visit them.    

 'These shootings clearly demonstrate the brutality of the Indonesian Military.    

 "The Greens are calling on the Federal Government to suspend discussions with Indonesia about  signing a security treaty agreeing to recognise the territorial integrity of Indonesia.    

 "Australia should not sign any agreement that stops them from speaking out against such  shootings and human rights abuses by the Indonesian military," Senator Nettle said.
