 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP 

 

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: 11.30am July 25 2004 

 TITLE:   Joint press conference in Adelaide by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Alexander Downer, and his New Zealand counterpart, Phil Goff,  following the six-monthly Australia New Zealand talks and the signing of  the Australia New Zealand Maritime Delimitation Treaty . 

 

 

 FOREIGN MINISTER DOWNER: I’ll say a few words, then I’ll ask Phil Goff, the  Foreign Minister of New Zealand, to say a few words, and then we’ll be happy to  answer  any  questions  you  might  have  about  Australia  and  New  Zealand  and  any   other issues you want to raise. But first of all let me say I’m delighted to have Phil  Goff  here,  the  New  Zealand  Foreign  Minister,  in  South  Australia.   We  spent  the   weekend on the South Coast at Victor Harbour, an opportunity not just to have our  six-monthly meeting, but also for the New Zealand Foreign Minister, and officials  from  the  New  Zealand  Foreign  Ministry  to  see  one  of  the  most  exciting  and   beautiful  parts  of  South  Australia.   I  hope  more  New  Zealand  tourists  will  come   and visit the south coast in the years ahead as a result of your visit there. 

  We  have  just  signed  the  Australia-New  Zealand  Maritime  Delimitation  Treaty.    This is a treaty that’s taken us four years to negotiate, which in the nature of these  things  is  not  a  particularly  long  period.   We’re  delighted  with  the  -  with  the   conclusion that has been reached.  It’s an historic event for both our countries. And  this is an equitable solution to a long remaining maritime boundary, which has not  been negotiated.  So now at long last it’s been concluded.   

  This  treaty  is  yet  another  example  of  the  breadth  and  depth  of  our  bilateral  

 relations.   We  often  -  Australians  and  New  Zealanders  make  points  about  our   sports - rivalry and all those sorts of things.  But in a big and difficult world out  there Australia and New Zealand work very closely together as a team.   

  We’ve spent quite a good deal of time talking about ways we’re going to enhance  our economic relationship.  The different ways we’re working together in the South  Pacific,  and  in  other  parts  of  the  world.   We  both  have  troops  in  Iraq,  and  New   Zealand, particularly, has some troops in Afghanistan.

  So we’re both contributing to the war against terror in a number of different ways,  and I think in that context the ANZAC spirit is very much alive and well.  I want to  -  in  mentioning  the  ANZAC  spirit  -  say  that  today,  or  this  weekend,  not  just   specifically  today,  its  particularly  significant  for  Australia  and  New  Zealand   because  it  represents  the  first  anniversary  of  our  intervention  in  The  Solomon   Islands.  That  intervention’s  been  led  by  Australia  with  tremendous  support  from   New Zealand.  And after one year in The Solomon Islands I think we can proclaim  that  so  far  the  Regional  Assistance  Mission  in  The  Solomon  Islands  has  been  a   very  great  success.   And  I  think  all  Australians  -  I’m  sure  this  applies  to  New   Zealanders as well - can be very proud of what we’ve achieved. 

  The last point I wanted to make is that during our discussion we focused some of  our  talks,  unusually,  on  Africa.   Normally  Australia  and  New  Zealand  wouldn’t   talk very much about Africa.  But both of us are particularly concerned about the  humanitarian  disaster  in  Sudan,  and  unusually  we’ve  issued  a  joint  press  release   about  it  expressing  our  concerns.Both  of  us  are  going  separately  to  announce   additional aid to The Sudan.  Australia has already provided $8 million.  But I think  when you look at the dimensions of the humanitarian crisis there, we - and I mean  by we the international community - of course Australia and New Zealand, but the  international community - need to do a lot more, and we need to do a lot better than  we  have  been  doing  in  Sudan.  There  are  between  1.1  and  1.2  million  people   displaced  in  the  western  part  of  Sudan  -  Dafour  region.   We  believe  in  the  last   fifteen months about 30,000 people have been killed, and there are large numbers  of people now dying through lack of access to food and clean water, and we have  to do more as an international community to help those people. 

  I think first and foremost the United Nations need to achieve a successful Security  Council resolution, ensuring that there is appropriate action - for example sanctions  against  Sudan  -  unless  the  Government  of  Sudan  improves  its  performance  very   substantially, authorising the establishment of a peace keeping force . And if there  is  to  be  a  United  Nations  peace  keeping  force,  Australia  has  already  given  some   consideration to a request from the United Nations that - for us to provide a small  number of troops, and we haven’t made a final decision on that.  We’ll wait to see  what  resolution  comes  through.   But  we  think  it  would  be  appropriate  for  us  to   make  a  small  contribution  to  such  a  peace  keeping  force  if  such  a  peace  keeping   force were to eventuate. But we’ve just got to wait and see.  So it’s a very big issue  for the international community, Sudan.  It’s yet another test for the United Nations  to  achieve  an  appropriate  Security  Council  resolution  so  the  international   community can take action.  

  There are difficulties at the moment in the Security Council, particularly over the  question of sanctions, with Russia and China resisting the imposition of sanctions  on Sudan.  But we’ve got to keep pressing on, and I hope the UN is able to achieve  a successful resolution.  But on the other hand, whatever happens there, we can’t   let people in Sudan die at the rate they’ve been dying.

  I’ll ask Phil if he’ll make a few remarks as well.  

  Thank  you.  

 NZ FOREIGN MINISTER PHIL GOFF:  Thank  you  very  much  Alexander,  ladies  and   gentlemen.  Well, the meeting this weekend represents the tenth meeting between  Alexander and myself. We generally meet on a six monthly basis to cover a wide  range of topics that are important in terms of our bilateral relations and our action,  jointly in many cases, in the Pacific and beyond the Pacific and the world. 

  The first meeting, indeed, was here in Adelaide, Alexander, in January 2000.  And  I think the nature of these meetings have been very amicable, very constructive, as  befits  the  relationship  between  our  two  countries  -  our  closeness  in  terms  of   geographic proximity, the historic context, the tradition of working together in the  world.  And I think today we can celebrate a number of things that have occurred in  the last six months.  The first, as you have just seen, is the signing of the Maritime  Boundary Delimitation between our two countries.  They also began in 1999.  They  worked  under  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea,  and  the   requirement to reach an agreement that is within international law, and to achieve a  result that is just and equitable. 

  And  I  think   both  of  our  countries  believe  that  we  have  achieved  just  that.   The   delimitation  in  terms  of  the  two  hundred  mile  exclusive  economic  zone  was   relatively straight-forward.  More complex, I think, in dealing with the delimitation  in  terms  of  the  extension  of  the  continental  shelf.   But  what  we  have  achieved   together is an agreement that is then submitted to the Commission on the Limits of  the  Continental  Shelf,  and  I  think  the  fact  that  there  is  a  mutual  agreement  with   ensure that those limitations will be held up by that particular commission.  There  were eight meetings.  We had people working, I think, with goodwill on both sides.   We had flexibility on both sides, and those two things are the core to the settlement  of an agreement of this nature. 

  And I say the second thing that we’re really celebrating was yesterday one year of  the Regional Assistance Mission in The Solomon Islands.  And it was just over a  year  ago  that  Alexander  and  I  met  at  Wilpena  Pound,  north  of  Adelaide,  within   South Australia. We talked about the issue of The Solomon Islands. Both of us had  expressed for some time our concern that the actions that we had taken to date were  not seeing progress made in The Solomon Islands.  We went from Wilpena Pound  to a meeting in Sydney of the foreign ministers of all of the Pacific Island Forum  countries.   And  we  achieved  unanimity  there  for  action  under  the  Biketawa   Declaration, which saw a clear and decisive intervention by the Pacific countries.

  And having returned from the Solomons just a matter of weeks ago, I can say how  much  that  country  has  changed  over  the  last  year.   That  law  and  order  prevails.    Nearly 4000 weapons destroyed.  Over 700 arrests.  The key culprits in terms of the  militia  under  arrest.   The  return  of  the  rule  of  law.   The  return  of  responsible   economic management. 

  What  we  have  achieved  there  as  a  Pacific  Forum  I  think  is  historic.   But  having   mentioned  what  we  have  achieved,  I  think  it’s  also  fair  to  say  that  perhaps  the   hardest  task  still  lies  ahead  of  us,  and  that  is  to  achieve  a  situation  that  is  self-sustaining  in  the  Solomon  Islands  of  good  governance,  of  the  rule  of  law  -   something  that  will  survive  beyond  the  period  of  the  RAMSI  mission.  And  New   Zealand, alongside Australia, has committed itself to a further extension of a small  group  of  defence  force  personnel,  on  a  rotational  basis.   We  have  committed   ourselves  to  ongoing  presence  of  the  New  Zealand  Police  Force  in  the  Solomon   Islands,  and  the  Somon  Islands  for  New  Zealand  represents  our  biggest   commitment  to  any  single  country  in  the  Pacific  in  terms  of  development   assistance. One of the great things we could deliver in The Solomons a couple of  weeks  ago  was  to  ensure  that  all  schools  in  The  Solomon  Islands  received  text   books created for the context of The Solomon Islands, a concrete deliverable from  the  peace  agreement  that  exists  there  to  ordinary  people  across  The  Solomon   Islands.  

  Aside from those two areas, we spent some time looking at the situation in Sudan.   OXFAM  suggests  that  even  if  better  security  measures  are  taken  now,  and  aid  is   delivered, that will not stop 350,000 people from dying in the Sudan.  That is not  just a disaster.  That is an international disgrace.  And while New Zealand has been  consistent  in  its  condemnation  of  what  has  been  happening  in  the  Sudan  over  a   period of the last couple of years, condemnation by itself will not save lives. 

  New  Zealand,  as  well  as  Australia,  have  committed  themselves  to  providing  aid,   emergency  relief  assistance  to  the  people  that  are  the  refugees  -  the  1.2  million   people.  But it will require more than that, and the Secretary-General of the United  Nations  has  requested  the  international  community  to  apply  pressure  to  the   Government of Sudan to live up to the commitments it made when it signed a joint  communique  with  Kofi  Annan  just  a  matter  of  weeks  ago.  As  well  as  Australia,   New Zealand is also ready to consider a request from the international community  to make a modest contribution to a peace keeping group in that country.  

  So aid, peace keeping, and pressure on the Government of Sudan to live up to its  commitments  is  vitally  necessary  if  we  are  to  avoid  genocide  of  people  in  the   southern Sudan. I think that that is something, while far away from our part of the  world, that we have a strong obligation to do.

  There  are  a  range  of  other  topics  that  we  don’t  have  time  to  go  into  and  detail,   unless  there  are  questions.   We  talked  about  the  leadership  forum  in  Wellington   earlier this year, which was the first leadership forum between our two countries.   Very  successful.   We’ll  be  repeating  that  in  May  next  year  in  Melbourne.  We   talked about a single economic market, between our two countries, as an ambition.   Building on the huge success of CER, the most successful, I think, trade agreement  between two countries anywhere in the world.   

  We’re  looking  forward  to  the  Pacific  Island  Forum  in  Apia  in  a  fortnight  to   continue the progress that was made in Auckland last year.   

 Along with Alexander, of course, I’m most happy to take any questions that you  might have.  

 DOWNER: Okay, if there are any questions we’re obviously happy to do our best to try to  answer them. 

 QUESTION: The al Qa’eda European news overnight, Alexander are you [indistinct]? 

 DOWNER:  Well,  we’re  still  investigating  the  credibility  of  this  website.   And  this   organisation.   I  wasn’t  aware  of  its  existence  myself  until  the  course  of  the  last   week, so ASIO are looking into the credibility of the organisation.  But we take all  threats  seriously.   But  on  the  other  hand,  Australia  sends  a  message  out  to  the   world, and that is that we won’t bow to threats.  In the end if we allow these sorts  of  threats  to  determine  our  foreign  policy,  then  what  we’ll  do  is  empower  the   terrorists, and of course if we empower the terrorists then the terrorists will become  increasingly virulent and increasingly successful.  I think a very important message  for Australia to send out in the face of these sorts of threats is that these sorts of  threats  won’t  change  Australian  foreign  policy.   But  at  this  stage  we’re  not   upgrading  our  security  warnings  here  within  Australia.  We  have  no  information   that would lead us to do that. 

 GOFF: Well, New Zealand takes a similar view to Australia in terms of the threats posed  by al Qa’eda.  And by offspring organisations, and organisations with links with it,  such  as  Jemaah  Islamiyah.   We  think  the  greatest  threat  to  international  security   and  stability  in  the  world  is  the  interconnected  links  between  terrorist  groups.    That’s why New Zealand is making a significant contribution in operation enduring  freedom.   That’s  why  we’re  running  a  provincial  reconstruction  team  in   Afghanistan.  That’s  why  we’ve  got  combat  forces  -  SAS  forces  -  in  Afghanistan   today,  and  why  we’re  participating  in  the  ISAF  in  helping  to  train  the  Afghan   National Army.   

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 6

  Those things are necessary because, regardless of whether or not this specific threat  is correct, we know that the - the organisation is continuing to try to mount attacks  against Westerners, regardless of their country of origin, across the world.  We lost  a relatively small number of people, compared to Australia, in Bali.  But you know,  twenty minutes later the number might have been a score, rather than three.  That’s  not a threat that we can overlook.  That’s why we continue to make these efforts,  and work internationally.  And I think, Alexander, most importantly in the Pacific.   Because  we  do  not  want  the  Pacific  to  be  a  weak  link  that  enables  international   terrorist groups to exploit opportunities in the Pacific or to base themselves in the  Pacific.  

 QUESTION: Mr Downer, would you be expecting our security services to be looking into  that - that Internet [indistinct]? 

 DOWNER: Yeah.  Certainly.  ASIO are looking into it. And they’ve got that job in hand  already. 

 QUESTION: Mr Downer, the fact that countries like The Philippines do bow to the threats,  does that put Australia at greater risk? 

 DOWNER:  Yes,  it  does.   There’s  no  doubt  that  the  decision  by  the  Spanish  to  withdraw   after  the  Madrid  bombings,  and  the  withdrawal  by  The  Philippines  recently  as  a   result of the kidnapping and the threatened execution of a Philippines national has  given greater strength to the terrorists.  We just can’t walk away from that.  That is  perfectly clear. These terrorists know that at least some countries will bow to their  threats.   That’s  why  we  go  out  of  our  way  to  make  it  very  clear  that  Australia   won’t.   And  I  know  New  Zealand  wouldn’t.   Countries  like  ours  won’t  bow  to   threats.  You won’t defeat terrorists by acceding to the demands of terrorists.  The  last thing we want is the international community to just - whatever people thought  about the overthrow of Saddam Hussein as a first step, the last thing we want now  is  the  international  community  just  to  abandon  the  Iraqi  Interim  Government  and   the  Iraqi  people  and  scurry  out  in  the  face  of  the  demands  of  terrorists,  and  have   those  terrorists  simply  take  control  of  Iraq.   Imagine  the  consequences  for   international security if that were to happen.  So no, we take any threat seriously.   We have to.  Can’t afford not to.  We investigate them fully, and - but we won’t   bow to terrorist threats. 

 GOFF: Unfortunately to save one life in a situation like that you actually put many more  lives in jeopardy, because the message that goes through to the terrorists is that a  country bows to that sort of demand on the basis of that individual’s life, then it’s  worthwhile them continuing to do it, and to take other people hostages.

  So  while  one  has  some  sympathy  for  the  family  and  indeed  for  the  leadership  of   The Philippines in the threat that was posed to them and the response that they have  made, that very clearly does increase the likelihood that those sort of actions will  continue and increase. 

 QUESTION:  Has  Australia  followed  up,  Mr  Downer,  with  any  formal  representations  in   relation to The Philippines on that view? 

 DOWNER: Well,  we  did  make  representations  to  The  Philippines  at  various  levels.   I   spoke to people, including The Philippines Ambassador here in Canberra, and our  Ambassador and other staff at our Embassy in Manila have followed the issue with  The Philippines.  But I mean, the decision’s been made now, and like Phil Goff I  know it would have been an agonisingly difficult decision for President Arroyo - I  have  plenty  of  sympathy  for  the  dilemma  she  found  herself  in,  but  we  hope  and   pray  we  won’t  have  to  make  the  same  -  be  put  in  the  same  position  ourselves  to   have  to  make  a  decision.   But  we’d  like  to  flag  in  advance  that  our  decision  will   always be to stand up to terrorists and blackmailers, never to give in to them. 

 QUESTION:  Do  you  know  [indistinct]  particular  group  how  strong  is  the   al  Qa’eda   presence in Europe that you’re aware of? 

 DOWNER:  There  are  al  Qa’eda  cells  in  Europe,  though  the  Europeans  have  been  pretty   effective  in  breaking  those  al  Qa’eda  cells  up.   But  there  obviously  has  been  a   significant al Qa’eda presence in Europe.  For example, the - some of the bombers  from nine eleven flew out of - originally flew out of Germany.  So - Hamburg, I   think  it  was  -  so  you  just  can’t  dismiss  the  fact  that  there  are  certainly  still  al   Qa’eda operatives in Europe.  It’s quite a problem. 

 QUESTION: Mr Downer, regarding the bad blood comment [indistinct] relating to the East  Timor  negotiations  on  gas  reserves,  you’re  obviously  pretty  disappointed  about   that. 

 DOWNER:  Well,  I  think  it’s  one  thing  to  be  the  Opposition,  and  make  the  usual  sort  of   points that oppositions make about governments - criticisms - a lot of the criticism  is  for  the  sake  of  criticism,  and  it’s  often  in  many  cases  seen  to  be  part  of  the   system.  I’ve been in Opposition and we did plenty of criticism - criticising of the  government  of  the  day,  of  course  -  Phil,  you  were  in  opposition  once,  you   probably … 

 GOFF:  [inaudible]  

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 8

 DOWNER:  So  we  understand  all  of  that  and  how  the  system  works,  but  there  is  a  point   where oppositions have to behave responsibly.  Now, we are at a very pivotal stage  of  our  negotiations  with  East  Timor  on  the  Timor  Sea.   We  already  have  two   agreements,  the  Timor  Sea  Treaty,  and  the  International  Unitisation  Agreement.    Labor voted for both of those in the Parliament, most recently at the end of March  this year for the Unitisation Agreement.  There has never been any criticism of our  position  by  the  Labor  Party  up  until  last  week.   I  would  have  assumed  for  good   reason  -  that  they  know  we’re  conducting  difficult  and  sensitive  negotiations.    We’re obviously talking about the sorts of positions that we can take in exploring  different  ideas  with  the  East  Timorese  to  reach  a  solution  to  this  problem.   And   then Mr Latham comes out during the course of last week, suddenly - the Leader of  the  Opposition,  not  some  errant  back-bencher,  but  their  leader  -  comes  out  and   says, well, if they’re elected, and of course we’re quite close to an election now, the  negotiations  will  start  all  over  again.   That  Labor  will  recommence  the   negotiations.  And then their - one of their spokesman, the spokesman, I think, on  energy,  has  come  out  and  said  well,  Labor  would  be  more  generous  than  the   Government.  

  Well,  Labor  doesn’t  know  what  position  the  Government  is  taking  in  the  private   negotiations, so our point to Mr Latham is we will give you a briefing during the  course of next week -  a private briefing - on where we’re at in these negotiations  and what the issues are.  But if the Labor Party is still going to take the view that it  wants to politicise these delicate negotiations, we’ll have no choice but to suspend  the  next  round  of  the  negotiations,  which  are  due  in  September,  until  after  the   election’s taking place.  Look, it - it’s just irresponsible politicking, and it simply  demonstrates  Mr  Latham’s  inexperience  and  naivety.   Look,  it’s  one  thing  to  run   the - to be the mayor of the Liverpool Council.  It’s another thing to be running the  foreign  policy  of  a  great  nation  like  Australia.  And  he  doesn’t  seem  to  have   graduated from the Liverpool City Council to national leadership. 

 QUESTION: Right then Mr Downer, have you [indistinct] marijuana? 

 DOWNER: I was asked this question … 

 GOFF:  [inaudible]  

 DOWNER:  That’s  right.   Oh,  no,  I’ve  thought  about  this,  though.  I   was  asked  this   question  ten  years  ago,  and  I  answered  the  question  ten  years  ago,  and  I’m  not   contributing anything more today to this debate.  Mr Latham decided he wanted to  talk about what he did in the past, and I’m not offering you any more information  than I offered back in 1993, or 19 - no, I think it was a bit earlier than that.  Might  have been - in the early 1990s, anyway. 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 9

 QUESTION: What was that? 

 DOWNER: You can check it on the website.  You can check it, but you can’t have a lazy  story.  

 QUESTION: Going back to [indistinct]? 

 DOWNER: Well, there isn’t really reticence, but the peace keeping force hasn’t been set  up.   We’ll  have  to  have  a  look  and  see  precisely  what  the  structure  of  the  peace   keeping  force  would  be,  and  we  want  to  have  a  look  at  what  the  composition  of   forces would be, what sort of skills we might be able, usefully, to add to a peace  keeping force. And what the broader security situation is at the time.  So I’m just  saying, as Senator Hill said yesterday, that our inclination is that we should provide  some support, albeit a very small amount of support, but we should provide some  support.  But  we’ll  just  have  to  wait  and  see  how  the  United  Nations  Security   Council handles this issue over the next few weeks. 

 QUESTION: And what do you make of the US Congress’s comments,  that it is genocide  [indistinct]? 

 DOWNER: Well, we - we haven’t adopted the actual term genocide, but I make the point  to you - you can have a debate about the semantics of this, but I make the point to  you  that  there  are  about  1.1  -  1.2  million  people  who  have  been  displaced,  and   there are, we think, in the last fifteen months, about 30,000 people who have been  killed.  It’s  a  problem  that  we  have,  you  know,  there  must  be  thousands  of   journalists on the ground in Iraq, but many many more people are being killed in  Sudan  than  are  being  killed  by  the  terrorists  in Iraq, yet there’s very, very little -  has been, up until now, very little media interest in it. And you know, we’d like to  generate more interest, I think, and more debate in our own country in this issue,  because this is an enormous humanitarian disaster.  Quite apart from the fact that  there are egregious abuses of human rights. 

  Okay, is that?  Anything else?  Good.
