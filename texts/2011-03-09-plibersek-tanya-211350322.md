 Media Release by The Hon Tanya Pibersek MP 

 Government boosts the voice of women  9 March 2010 

 Tanya Plibersek, today announced the establishment of six National Women’s Alliances. 

 The alliances, which will share in $3.6 million over three years from the Australian Government, comprise 

 women’s organisations and individuals from across Australia. 

 Each alliance has a specific focus: economic security, equality rights, violence against women, immigrant 

 and refugee women, rural, and Indigenous women. 

 Through these alliances, women and women’s organisations will share information, identify issues that 

 affect them, and identify solutions. 

 The alliances will engage actively with the Australian Government on policy issues as part of a better 

 more informed and representative dialogue between women and government. 

 Most importantly, the alliances are about inclusion. The National Women’s Alliances will ensure that the 

 voices of a variety of women are heard, including those that have not been well represented in the past. 

 They will allow women to actively engage with all levels of government by identifying and responding to 

 current issues. 

 I look forward to listening to the ideas and opinions of the new alliances and I encourage women 

 throughout Australia to get involved. 

 The alliances will be encouraged to align strategically with government priorities, building broad 

 collaborative networks to ensure representation for all women, especially those who in the past have 

 found it difficult to engage in advocacy and decision making. 

 The Australian Government will work together with the alliances in the coming weeks to establish 

 funding arrangements and to discuss the best ways of working together. 

 Funding has been offered to three alliances to focus on specific issues: 

 ï· Economic Security for Women will focus on improving women’s economic security and financial 

 independence 

 ï· Equality Rights Australia (ERA) will address gender equality and leadership issues and 

 ï· Women Everywhere Advocating Violence Elimination (WEAVE) will address issues of women’s safety 

 and the elimination of violence. 

 In addition, funding has also been offered to three alliances to represent specific groups of women: 

 ï· The Australian Immigrant and Refugee Women’s Alliance will engage with and advocate on behalf of 

 immigrant and refugee women, with a particular focus on building leadership and advocacy skills 

 among its members 

 ï· The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women’s Alliance will give Indigenous women a 

 strong voice in Government decision making and 

 ï· The National Rural Women’s Coalition and Network will provide a voice for more than 250,000 

 women in rural and regional Australia and fulfills the Government’s election commitment to establish 

 a national network for rural women.
