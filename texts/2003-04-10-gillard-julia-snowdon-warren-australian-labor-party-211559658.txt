 Charities unable to cope with refugee crisis   

 JOINT MEDIA RELEASE

  The Shadow Minister for Population and Immigration has been told that community organisations in Darwin will soon be unable to provide for the needs of the Northern Territory’s East Timorese asylum seekers.  The Red Cross and the St Vincent de Paul Society met with Julia Gillard and the Member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, today to discuss the growing crisis in the community, as another Darwin family of asylum seekers was stripped of financial and medical support.  Ms Gillard said the Federal Government’s refusal to debate legislation that would grant a permanent end to the trauma was stretching the capacity of charities to breaking point.  “The Minister for Immigration is refusing to recognise that this crisis exists,” Ms Gillard said.  “These people fled to Australia seeking shelter from persecution, but were neglected by successive governments for a decade.  “This was not their fault, but now they’re being left to starve.”  Today’s move by the Department of Immigration to cut off asylum seeker support payments to a family of six means that nineteen of Darwin’s East Timorese have been left to rely on friends and charities to survive — a number that is expected to double by the end of the month.  The Department plans to cut off this support to 50 East Timorese in the Territory, mostly children, the elderly and working parents on very low incomes.   The Department has admitted that the asylum seekers could wait up to nine months before they receive a decision on whether they can stay.  Mr Snowdon said the removal of basic support to children and the elderly was disgraceful.  “What has happened to this country, when the Government can force people to make do with nothing?” Mr Snowdon said.  “These people need help immediately, not when the Government makes up its mind in nine months’ time.”  Mr Snowdon said the Government had twice delayed the introduction of Labor’s amendment to the Migration Act without providing an explanation.  If passed in both houses of Parliament, the amendment will provide the 1600 East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia with special humanitarian visas that will give them permanent residency.
