 PRO PER PROCESS MUST PROCEED

 The Government's failure to reform the refugee determination system in  time to avert much of the frustration and anger felt by the detainees in Port  hedland is itself unconscionable and the Minister should accept part of the  responsibility for the current circumstances.

 However, the detainees in Port Hedland do their cases no good by  demonstrating in the manner they have over the past few days.

 Speaking after his visit to the Port Hedland facilities last month, Philip  Ruddock, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs said, "clearly  the policy which has led to the long term holding of people in detention has  had an adverse impact on their physical, emotional and spiritual well being."

 Unfortunately their distress has led to desperate actions. "Unless expeditious  and fair procedures can be put in place quickly to deal with these and future  applications, the potential for similar incidents will increase", Mr Ruddock  warned.

 "After speaking with the detainees last month, it was very clear to me that  they were anxious for decisions to be taken conclusively, and while all would  obviously want decisions to be favourable, they are now at the point where  what they really seek, is simply a final decision."

 "However, the actions of some of the detainees will not, and ought not to  have any bearing on the refugee application process and the Minister is right  to make this very clear to those contemplating similar action."
