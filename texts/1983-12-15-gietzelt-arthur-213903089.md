 SENATOR ARTHUR GIETZELT Minister for Veterans’ Affairs

 ______________________ ____________________________________

 N ew s R elease... New s Release...

 The Minister for Veterans' Affairs,  Senator Arthur Gietzelt,   today released details of further cases of service pensioners  with large capital assets who have contrived their financial  affairs in order to circumvent the income test.

 "These cases,  which are typical of many in the Departmental  files,  simply serve to emphasise the need for an effective  income and assets test for pensioners," he said.

 Senator Gietzelt said he had detected a definite shift in public  opinion in relation to the proposed income and assets test. This was particularly noticeable following the Government's  decision to allow a $30,000 exemption on 'lifestyle' assets 

 such as holiday homes,  caravans and boats.

 "People are now accepting that the Government has acted  responsibly in this matter," he said.

 "Since the test has been explained fully, people have realised  that it is an equitable and not a harsh measure. They are  also accepting that if the Government is going to fulfill its  pledge to increase pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly 

 earnings, its welfare priorities must be for those in need."

 The cases Senator Gietzelt highlighted are:

 * A retired Government worker in New South Wales had  $160,000 in a non-interest-bearing cheque account. He and his wife received a full service pension of  $143.20 a week. They are also eligible for fringe  benefits.

 * A Queensland pensioner and his wife invested their $200,000  retirement benefits in two blocks of flats about four  years ago. Since that time, the unimproved capital value of the land alone has increased by 730 per cent, 

 from $14,000 to $102,600. Rental from the flats in the  twelve months to August this year amounted to $4,478  before tax. This couple receive the full service  pension and are eligible for fringe benefits.

 Senator Gietzelt said he could see no justification for persons  holding assets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars while  still receiving full pensions with fringe benefits. This was  especially true when it was considered that many pensioners were 

 struggling to make ends meet with no more than the basic pension.

 "Anyone who believes in the principle of 'a fair go' would have  to agree with me on this score," he said.
