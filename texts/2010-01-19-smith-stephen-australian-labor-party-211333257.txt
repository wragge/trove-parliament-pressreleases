 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  STEPHEN SMITH, MP 

 

 Transcript: Foreign Minister Smith press conference, Parliament House, Canberra   

 19 January 2010   

 Topics: Haiti, Oceanic Viking, Hambali trial, Jetstar in Vietnam, AUSMIN   

 STEPHEN SMITH: I’d like to give you an update on Haiti.  Firstly, so far as Australians in  Haiti are concerned, can I take the opportunity of personally expressing  my condolences to the family of Mr Wooldridge, the dual British  Australian citizen who yesterday, we confirmed, regrettably, was killed.  He was working for the UN and had been residing in the United  Kingdom.     

 We've accounted for 27 Australians who were in Haiti at the time of the  earthquake. We have no evidence or information at this stage to suggest  any other Australians were or are in the area.    

  So having expressed our condolences and regrets to the friends and 

 families of Mr Wooldridge, we're of course relieved that we have no  additional information so far as Australians are concerned.    

  You recall that last week I announced Australian assistance of $5 million  for immediate emergency assistance, and $5 million for longer term  reconstruction.    

  Given the extent of the tragedy, and the call by the United Nations for 

 further assistance, I'm announcing today an additional $5 million for  immediate emergency humanitarian assistance from Australia.  This will  bring to $10 million the contribution that Australia has made for 

 emergency assistance. That $10 million will be funded through the World  Food Programme, through the Red Cross, through Australian and  international non-government organisations. Also, through the United  Nations' coordination office, and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency  Management Agency.    

  We reserve the right after consultation in due course with the United 

 Nations, and also with CARICOM, and the Caribbean Disaster  Emergency Management Agency, to make a further contribution so far as  long-term reconstruction is concerned.

  This is a substantial contribution from Australia.  And it reflects the scale 

 and the extent of the tragedy, but also Australia's greater engagement  with the Caribbean, and CARICOM - the regional organisation.  You  might recall that in November last year we signed a memorandum of  understanding with the CARICOM nations dealing with disaster  management and emergency relief.    

  I've seen as you would have suggestions that the United Nations is 

 contemplating, through the Security Council, of increasing the  peacekeeping presence in Haiti. There is already a substantial  peacekeeping presence - some 9000 military, and 2000 police officers.    The Security Council, in the next 12 hours or so, will consider a 

 recommendation from the Secretary General that this compliment be  increased. Australia won't be providing any peacekeepers, either military  or police officers. Currently, there are some 20 countries in the region  and countries with a longstanding association with Haiti who provide a  military contribution. And about 40 countries who provide a police  contingent.    

  We are, however, in discussion with the United Nations as to whether 

 there are Australians with particular expertise who may be required.  That's technical expertise so far as logistics is concerned, or  communications, or engineering - some of the acute difficulties at  present.    

  But it's not proposed that Australia provide additional personnel, either  military or police personnel. So an update there. I'm happy to respond to  your questions on what is of course a terrible tragedy, which we've all  seen unfold.    

 The nature and the extent of the tragedy, of course, has far exceeded the  initial reports. And that is of course a further reason why Australia today  makes an additional contribution.    

  I welcome very much the spirit of generosity that we've seen from 

 Australians who have been contributing very handsomely, so far as  appeals from Australian and international NGOs are concerned.    I'm happy to respond to your questions.  

 

 QUESTION: Where do you [indistinct] tracking how quickly this money's been spent  and delivered to people on the ground? Is there talk about some slowness  in the aid getting through.  

 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well there's always, in the initial stages of a response, difficulties with  coordination. And we've seen those occur.  But the reports today both  from the United Nations, from the United States, from other countries 

 

  3

 like Brazil who have an important role, and from the Government of  Haiti itself, is that the coordination is now much better.    

  We work very hard at trying to get the disaster management relief 

 coordination better, but every particular circumstance brings its own  difficulties. So in this case, for example, given the very significant  presence of the United Nations, the terrible loss of life so far as United  Nations personnel are concerned, we've got the United Nations and the  Government of Haiti in overall authority.    

  The United States has been given operational charge of humanitarian  assistance, and Brazil in charge of security. Brazil of course are heading  up the United Nations peacekeeping presence in Haiti.  Over the  weekend I spoke to my Brazilian counterpart, Celso Amorim, and we  spoke about the contribution that Australia was making, but also spoke  about the difficulties of coordination.    

  So we've targeted our contribution to those life-saving requirements: to  food, to water, to shelter, equipment, to sanitation, medicines, and the  like.  We think this is the most important and appropriate contribution  that Australia could make. It's often in these cases more important that  individual nations deliver that which is required, not all of the things that  we can provide.  So we're confident that we're making an appropriate  contribution but also targeting those things which can be of most  assistance at this point in time.  We're confident that those supplies will  be delivered in a timely way by the agencies concerned.  

 

 QUESTION: How can Australians best help the Haitian people?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: By continuing, I think, to respond generously to the calls by the  Australian and international non-government organisations, the aid  organisations, who are delivering on the ground the much needed life  saving equipment; whether it's through medicines, whether it's through  water, whether it's through food. Water and food and shelter are  obviously key requirements at this point.    

 QUESTION: Why aren't we seeing the level of Australian generosity that we did after  the 2004 tsunami?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: I think we are. Let’s bear in mind that Australia has not had historically a  substantial engagement with the countries of Latin America and the  Caribbean.  The current Government has moved to enhance our  relationships because we see that as being in Australia's national interest.  So when you look at the contribution the Australian people are making  directly and the Australian Government is making on behalf of the  Australian people, this is historically a substantially much larger  contribution than we would previously have made. That reflects our

 enhanced engagement but also reflects the size and the extent of the  human tragedy.    

 QUESTION: Minister has the international response been adequate in your opinion?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Yes, I believe so, and it will continue to be. There are always issues and  difficulties of coordination in the early stages and we work very hard to  try and overcome those.  But the reports overnight from the United  Nations, United States, from Haiti, and other relevant countries like  Brazil very clearly indicate that we're getting on top of the coordination  difficulties.    

 QUESTION: Mr Smith, if a decision is made to send communications personnel or  engineers, might they be Defence personnel?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: That's a possibility, but they wouldn't be part of any peacekeeping force.  We're in discussions with the United Nations as to whether there are any  technical experts who may be of assistance.  I'll happily indicate in due  course the nature and extent of that.  That is one possibility but we're not  proposing to respond by way of a peacekeeping contribution.    

 QUESTION: Just on the Oceanic Viking.  Four countries now, I think, have agreed to  take asylum seekers from that boat. What role did you or the government  play in trying to get those countries to agree to resettle them? 

 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well I'll leave the detail to my colleague, the Minister for Immigration,  but Senator Evans has made clear that of course the Government was in  conversation with other countries about coordination with the UNHCR  for resettlement purposes.  I spoke to a number of my foreign ministerial  counterparts from countries who have traditionally either played a role in  resettlement of refugees or have played a direct role in resettlement of  refugees from Indonesia. I'll leave the details to Senator Evans in terms  of where particular people have or are proposed to be resettled.  But he's  made it clear I think, has previously made it clear that discussions have  occurred in conjunction with the UNHRC with resettlement countries.    

 QUESTION: Did you - did Australia offer anything or make an gestures to try and get  those countries to do that?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: No, the conversations we had were conversations which were about  resettlement, either because countries had previously participated in  resettlement of refugees from Indonesia or because they were countries  with a strong track record of resettlement.    

 QUESTION: The Obama Administration is considering trying Hambali in Washington.  The father of one of the victims, Brian Deegon has raised concern that  that opens avenues of defence that wouldn't be the case if he were tried in 

 

  5

 Indonesia where the Bali bombings occurred. Do you share his concerns  about the trial?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: We obviously want to see Hambali brought to justice. I've previously  made it clear that in the first instance the location of any trial and the  manner of any trial is in the first instance a matter for the US prosecuting  authorities and that remains the case.    

 QUESTION: Is there any update on the Qantas executive or Jetstar executives in  Vietnam?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: On Friday of last week I spoke with the Vietnamese Ambassador in  Perth. The Ambassador was in Perth as part of his regular consultations. I  made the point to him that Australia had a keen interest in the Qantas or  the Jetstar executives.  The Ambassador undertook to relay those  expressions of interest to the Vietnamese Government. I also relayed the  substance of my conversation to Qantas. I understand Qantas executives  remain in direct contact with Vietnamese authorities as they should. It's  quite clear from my conversations that the focus of the Vietnamese  authorities is an investigation where they want the two Qantas or Jetstar  executives to assist them in their investigations.   

  But it's been made quite clear to me that the Qantas executives, or the 

 Jetstar executives, are not the focus of the investigation and we've made  it clear to the Vietnamese authorities that the sooner the investigation  concludes and the sooner the  Australians are able to return to Australia  then the better we'll all be.    

 QUESTION: Is there any word on the rescheduling AUSMIN at this stage?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: No, just when I had the conversation with Secretary of State Clinton  early on Thursday morning, we agreed we would reconvene at a mutually  convenient time as soon as possible.  But once the dust has settled on the  Secretary of State's direct involvement in the Haiti disaster relief then  officials will take it up. There's also of course the prospect that I'll have a  conversation with the Secretary of State in London at the Afghanistan  conference next week on the 28th.    

  All right. Thanks. Thanks very much. Cheers.
