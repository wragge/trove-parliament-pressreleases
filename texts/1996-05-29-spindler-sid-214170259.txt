 Democrats restore  Medicare to asylum seekers

 In a significant win for the Australian Democrats, the Senate today disallowed a  ministerial order to deny Medicare for asylum seekers.

 Democrat Senator Sid Spindler who moved the motion said "The Senate has today  said that asylum seekers are not second class citizens.

 "The Senate's action was particularly urgent in view of the Government's refusal to  deny that the alternative avenue for medical services, the Asylum Seeker's  Assistance Scheme, (ASAS) is going to be severely cut.

 , "In any case, the ASAS scheme provides a lower standard of service than that  provided for other Australian residents. .

 "Asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia, for example, may have suffered  incredible pain and fear. We will not treat them as though they are of a lower order.

 "The ideologues in the Liberal and National Party are on a fund-cutting rampage  targeting the weak and inarticulate.

 The Government provided no evidence that the system is being rorted despite  Senator Spindler's invitation to do so.

 "The Democrats would support any necessary reforms to prevent the abuse of the  system, but we will not support a blanket ban on assistance to the most needy,"  Senator Spindler concluded.
