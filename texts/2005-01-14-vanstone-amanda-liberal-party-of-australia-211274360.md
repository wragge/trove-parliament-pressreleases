 Working Holiday Makers Boost Australian Economy 

 VPS 018/2005

 Latest figures show that Australia's Working Holiday Maker program continues to be a huge success, Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda  Vanstone, said today. 

 With more than 39 000 Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visas granted in the first four months of the current financial year, Australia looks like  issuing more than the 93 000 visas issued last program year. 

 ‘This increase in WHM visitors to Australia will further boost the $1.3 billion spent annually by people visiting Australia under the program,’  Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘A series of recent WHM agreements with France, Italy, Belgium and Taiwan and Estonia will provide a further boost to the Australian economy,’  she said.

 The 2003-04 figure for WHM visa grants was a 5.6 per cent increase on the year before, showing the continued growth of the program.

 ‘The Working Holiday Maker program ensures that young people aged between 18 and 30 from overseas can get to know Australia and that young  Australians have the opportunity to do the same through working overseas,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘The program also has economic benefits because it provides labour for Australian industries needing short-term casual workers, particularly in  regional Australia,’ she said. 

 The top countries for Working Holiday Makers visiting Australia were the UK, Ireland, Japan, Germany, the Republic of Korea and Canada.

 ‘The overwhelming majority of people receiving these visas are in the younger age bracket; about 70 per cent of visas go to people aged 22 to 26  years.

 ‘It’s no wonder then that 93 per cent of applications and grants are made on line via the internet - a technology that is a natural part of life for  younger people’ the Minister said.

 Applications for a Working Holiday visa can be made directly through the department’s website at www.immi.gov.au by selecting Online Services  (eVisas) from the main menu.
