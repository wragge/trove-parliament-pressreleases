 KEVIN RUDD M.P.   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs   

 TRUTH OVERBOARD - YET AGAIN   

 Why were the Australian people deceived before the last election over Senator Herron’s  diplomatic appointment?   

 Once again, the Howard Government has proven it puts politics first and truth last in its  dealings with the Australian people.   

 We have seen this with John Howard’s performance on Children Overboard (John Howard  said before the election that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard, while his  Government knew from the beginning that they hadn’t).   

 We have seen this with Mr Howard’s performance on Australia’s pre-war membership of the  Coalition of the Willing (John Howard said we hadn’t signed up, George Bush confirmed we  had).   

 And now we see it with Mr Howard’s performance on the diplomatic appointment of  Queensland Liberal Senator John Herron to Ireland (John Howard’s spokesman saying prior  to the 2001 election there was “nothing in it,” whereas we now know from FOI that the  Howard Government had sent four diplomatic cables to foreign governments prior to the  election seeking to arraign Senator Herron’s appointment).   

 We now see the same on Medicare where Mr Howard puts his hand on his heart saying he is  preserving Medicare whereas the truth is he is destroying it and retaining it in name only.   

 All these demonstrate a deep pattern of behaviour on the part of Prime Minister Howard.   

 Mr Howard’s entire political style rests on his mastery of the political science of half-truth.    

 What the most recent revelations of the Herron affair demonstrate is a continuing cancer  within the heart of the Howard Government; a Prime Minister who will do anything, say  anything and evade everything in order to obtain his political objectives.    

 Mr Howard’s secondary cancer is arrogance. An arrogance which says there is no problem  whatsoever in organising a quarter of a million dollar job for Peter Reith - the person, apart  from Howard himself, most centrally responsible for the Children Overboard Affair.    

 The big question now is where this arrogance and half-truth will lead the Howard  Government in the next rumoured appointment of Senator Alston to Paris…   

 Ends 28 April 2003
