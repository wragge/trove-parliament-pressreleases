 FUNDING FOR REFUGEE SETTLEMENT SUPPORT    

 Senator  Carol  Brown,  Labor  Senator  for  Tasmania  today  announced  two   organizations  in  Hobart  will  receive  $386,752  in  funding  to  assist  refugees  and   migrants become self-reliant and settle in Hobart.    

 A total of three projects from two local organisations will be funded under the Federal  Government’s Settlement Grants program. The Program aims to help refugees and  migrants become independent, acquire crucial skills and insights into life in Australia  and to contribute to the national economy.   

 Organisation  Migrant Resource Centre (Southern Tasmania)     $171,900 

 The Roman Catholic Trust Corporation of the Archdiocese of Hobart  $214,852          TOTAL:   $386,752  

 

 “The Government recognises the important role community organisations play  helping migrants and refugees settle into the community and build rewarding lives in  Australia.   

 “This funding allows our local organisations to offer information sessions and cultural  orientation programs, with activities focused on our legal system as well as driving  and road safety.    

  “These projects help new arrivals to Tasmania feel more comfortable and more  supported whilst equipping them with the tools they need to become self-reliant and  successfully settle into the community,” Senator Carol Brown said.   

 Funding through the Settlement Grants Program is targeted to assist refugees,  family sponsored migrants and the dependants of those on skilled migration visas  with low levels of English.
