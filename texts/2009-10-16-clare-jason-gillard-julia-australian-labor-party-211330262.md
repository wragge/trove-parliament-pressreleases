 ISSUES:  Launch of the Keep Australia Working report; Jobs Fund; Apprenticeships;  asylum seekers 

 

 JULIA GILLARD:   Well can I say it’s a very great pleasure to be here, at Victoria  University in the electorate of Lalor, here in Werribee. I’m the local member for this  electorate and obviously here in that capacity, and as Deputy Prime Minister.   

 And I’m joined by the Ministers who work closely with me on supporting jobs in Australia  today, most particularly Senator Mark Arbib and Parliamentary Secretary Jason Clare. 

 I’m also very pleased to be joined today by Lindsay Fox, who has been working with us to  keep Australia working and to encourage businesses around the country to support  employment, to support apprentices, to support trainees during the difficult days of the global  recession.  

 And I’d also like to very particularly acknowledge my parliamentary colleague Senator Steve  Fielding, who has worked closely with us on keeping Australia working during these difficult  days. 

 I’d like to thank the Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University, Liz Harman, who is with us  today; and also all of the people who have joined us who are on the pre-apprenticeship  program, for showing such patience with me and my newly acquired building skills. 

 We’re here today for a very important announcement. When Senator Mark Arbib and Jason  Clare were first appointed as Minister and Parliamentary Secretary, we decided we wanted to  take more steps to keep Australia working during the days of the global recession. I asked  them to provide me with a report about what we could do to keep Australia working. They  provided me with that report and today we launch that report. 

 Of course we have acted as a government decisively and quickly to support Australian jobs  during the days of the global recession. And whilst we saw a decrease in unemployment in  the last month to 5.7 per cent, we know that there are around 1.5 per cent more Australians  unemployed this time, compared with last year. That is, the unemployment rate has increased  by 1.5 per cent in 12 months.  

 That means that there area round 600 000 Australians who are experiencing the great  difficulties that unemployment brings. That’s why we’ve got to continue to support  Australian jobs through the delivery of our economic stimulus package.   

 But we’ve been looking to do more.  And today I’m here with my parliamentary colleagues  to announce that we will do more. 

 A key focus of the Keep Australia Working forums that Minister Arbib, Parliamentary  Secretary Clare, Lindsay Fox and Bill Kelty have been conducting for us around the country  is what we can do to support apprenticeships during these difficult days of the global  recession.  

 And if I can take you to a few disturbing figures there. We know that in the last twelve  months we’ve seen the commencement of apprenticeships in traditional trades plummet by  around 20 per cent. It is a deeply concerning figure. That means there are around 10 000 less  apprenticeships who have commenced in their trade this year, than in previous years.  

 And we know from past economic downturns, particularly the recession of the 1990s that it  took almost a decade for apprentice commencements to come back to normal levels after that  downturn. 

 This time round we can’t wait that long. We can’t afford to lose skills. We can’t afford to  have young people miss out on the kind of start in life that an apprenticeship brings. We’ve  been listening to small business and big business and the message they have given us is that  they need during these difficult days, additional incentives to take on apprentices during the  downturn.  So today, with my colleagues, I’m very pleased to announce that the Rudd  Government will more than triple the incentives for employers to start an apprentice. 

 This is going to be a kick-start. It’s going to be focused over the coming summer months. It’s  going to be focused on our young people. On getting employers over these summer months,  after the end of school, to pick up a new apprentice and to be paid more than triple the usual  incentive money to do so. This will mean that employers will get a bonus of almost $5000 to  put on that new apprentice. 

 It means that that bonus has gone from $1500 to almost $5000, and I can say to employers  that we know that they don’t want to be tied up in red tape so there will be no new paperwork  to get this additional bonus.  

 We believe that this will support up to 21,000 apprenticeships. That’s important.  It’s  important for our young people who are going to be looking for a job opportunity as they  come out of school, particularly in the summer months. It’s important to the nation’s future,  because when our economy turns to growth we want to make sure we’ve got the skilled  people that this nation needs to build its future. 

 And here today we can see the faces of some of the young people that this kind of new  measure will help. A particular kick-start - a new bonus, more than triple - in order to get  employers over this summer in order to get an apprentice on. 

 I’ll turn at this stage to my parliamentary colleague Jason Clare who may want to say a few  words about what we’ve learned about the demand for apprentices and the need to support  apprenticeships during these days through our Keep Australia Working forums and then I’ll  ask Senator Fielding and Lindsay Fox to make some comments.  

 

 JASON CLARE: Thanks Julia. In the last twelve months we’ve seen a big drop in the  number of young people starting apprenticeships. We need to turn that around and build it  back up. We need to train more butchers, bakers and modern-day candlestick makers— electricians— for the jobs of the future. We need more electricians, more plumbers, more  carpenters, more bricklayers. This is about helping employers to put them on. It’s about  making sure that young people have the skills that they need for the jobs of the future.  

 In the 1990s when the recession hit, there was a big fall in the number of apprentices starting  apprenticeships. And it took a decade before Australia was starting the same amount of  apprenticeships as before that recession. We can’t let that happen again, and that’s what this  is all about.   

 In the last three months, Mark, Bill Kelty, Lindsay Fox and myself have been travelling  around the country talking to employers in places that have been hit hardest by the global  recession. Places like South-West Sydney and South-West Perth. In Cairns, where  unemployment is now 12.5 per cent or places like Burnie and Devonport in Tasmania. 

 And employers tell us the same thing everywhere we go. And that is, that they need more  support and more help to put more apprentices on. And that’s what this is about. It’s about  keeping Australia working and making sure we have got the skills we need for the challenges  of the future.  

 

 STEVE FIELDING: Not all kids want to go to Uni. But all kids want the hope of a job. And  today we are giving kids that hope. The hope of getting a job as an apprentice.  Nations are  built on hope, and today we are giving Australian kids the hope of a job. Family First could  see how the global financial crisis was going to take away the hope of getting a job for many  Australians. That’s why when I sat down with the Treasurer back in February with the  stimulus package, I wanted to make sure we had something to help get communities working  again. So Family First Get Communities Working Fund was all about giving Australians that  hope of getting a job in their local community and today I’m very pleased and very excited to  see us kick-start more jobs for apprentices. It is really important. And a nation is built on  making sure our younger generation can have a job, the opportunity of job and nothing better  than apprentices to help build Australia for the future. 

 

 LINDSAY FOX: Well one of the nice things about the job that I’ve been doing with Bill  Kelty and working with Jason and Mark has been that most of the locations have all had an  issue about putting on young people and what can be done about it. I’m delighted with the  mere fact that the Government has been prepared to listen and act accordingly. As a result of 

 that process that they’ve come through with, I’ll be talking to most of the major employers of  Australia and see what they can do about putting on additional apprentices in the coming  year. Thank you. 

 JULIA GILLARD: Thank you very much, and can I specifically acknowledge that of course  this initiative to kick-start apprenticeships is being funded through our Jobs Fund. We have  had the first round of funding from the Jobs Fund - $132 million which supported 172  projects. Today’s announcement represents some finetuning of the economic stimulus in the  Jobs Fund and I’d like to specifically thank Senator Steve Fielding and Senator Brown for  their cooperation with the Government, for working with us on the creation of the Jobs Fund  and on today’s announcement to kick-start apprenticeships. 

 We’re very happy to take questions on today’s announcement first, and then if people want to  move to general questions, we’ll ask our friends from Victoria University to step out of shot  at that stage. So are there questions on today’s announcement? 

 

 JOURNALIST: Are you confident that  

 JULIA GILLARD: Well the important thing is get people the opportunity to get a start as an  apprentice.  What we know, is once you’ve got that all-important qualification, your ability to  get a job, to get the next job, to stay employed, is really increased by having that all-important qualification. The people most at risk during economic downturns tend to be our  young people and if we don’t get them the opportunity to get a start, to get a trade, to get a  job, then they can end up in very difficult circumstances for a very long period of time. That  was the tragic lesson of the last recession. A lot of young people didn’t get a foothold in the  labour market; didn’t get that all important apprenticeship or first job and were unemployed  many years later. And at the same time, employers were crying out for skilled labour. Well  we want to do everything we can to kick-start apprenticeships; to get these young people into  a job; to get them with that all-important trade certificate. It is good for the young people  involved; it’s good for the nation because we’ll need that skilled labour. 

 JOURNALIST:   You describe this as .  Where’s that $100 million coming  off…what’s now not getting $100 million? 

 JULIA GILLARD:  The $100 million is coming out of the Jobs Fund. There will be further  Jobs Funds funding rounds. 

 

 JOURNALIST: So is it unallocated? 

 JULIA GILLARD: That’s right. The Jobs Fund money was an agreement that the  Government made at the time that we determined that we had to act decisively to support jobs  through economic stimulus. It was an agreement we made with Senator Fielding and with  Senator Brown. We have obviously looked for the best possible way of spending that Jobs  Fund money. This, we believe is a great  way  of doing it, because as young people come into  our labour force, looking for work, end of the school year, this will be a time specific kick-start, more than tripling the incentive that an employer will get for taking on an apprentice. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Just on the numbers, this is of course 21 000, you’re already putting in some  money, so these apprentices is this 21 000 on top of that or including ones that you’ve already  got? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Well this is the outcome that we are expecting from the complete bundle  of incentives. The incentives are moving from $1500 to almost $5000. So it’s a huge  increase, more than tripling. It’s time-specific because we want employers picking up young  people this summer and getting them a start as we move into next year. 

 

 JOURNALIST: How confident are you that employers will take up the offer? 

 JULAI GILLARD: Well, as Lindsay Fox says, and Jason Clare and Mark Arbib have picked  up this feedback as they have gone around the country. What people have said to them at  local Keep Australia Working forums, employers have said they need additional incentives at  this difficult time to keep up their training efforts and to keep giving apprenticeships jobs.  And at the same time, the concern about young people in communities has come right  through.  

 We don’t want to see young people unemployed and not able to get this kind of opportunity.  So we’ve put the two together, put that feedback from employers with our passionate concern  to make sure that young Australians get a start and get a start through that vital trade  certificate and that is how this program has been designed. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  This program has apparently come out of feedback from the  KAW tour. Is there anything else you’ve put up that has yet to be embraced by the  Government? 

 LINDSAY FOX: Now, there are several things we’re talking about at the moment, but it’s  really a matter of getting them on the table, and when they’re on the table then going and  talking to the leaders of the industries where they can be placed. There are probably another  two or three that could come up at any time, but it’s just a matter of how we go over the latter  period of this initial process. We’ve been on the road now for about four months and we’ve  spoken in every capital city and probably 50 per cent of the regions that are the worst off in  Australia and this is the feedback that we’ve had so far. But I’m optimistic that if there are  special situations, I’m sure the Government will look favourably on having those things come  forward.  

 

 JULIA GILLARD: Now do we have general questions, not about today’s announcement? 

 JOURNALIST: The Nationals have come out today and said that the deaths of a number of  asylum seekers are the result of Labor’s detention policies. What is your response? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Well I’d like to make a very clear response. I’ve heard that, I’ve heard  that the Opposition, in fact the leader of the National Party Warren Truss, has made a very  vile, indeed despicable, allegation against the Government. I would be calling on Mr Turnbull  to have Mr Truss apologise for and withdraw that allegation immediately. Until Mr Turnbull 

 does that then it is absolutely crystal clear that no-one can take him or anything he says  seriously about the issue of asylum seekers. And I’d also say, I think this conduct by the  Opposition, by Mr Truss in particular, this conduct shows that the Opposition is back to what  it does best - and that’s engage in the politics of fear and smear. We saw that in the middle of  this year through the fake email affair, it appears that they’ve learned absolutely nothing from  that fake email affair, absolutely nothing about what are the appropriate standards of conduct  in public life. So I would make it very clear to Mr Turnbull, he’s got one job to do, and that’s  to ensure that Mr Truss apologises and withdraws this disgraceful allegation. 

 JOURNALIST: Alexander Downer has said that the Rudd Government has put people  smugglers back in business. What’s your response to that? 

 JULIA GILLARD: I think Mr Downer probably still has some explaining to do from his  days in public life, when he was a member of the Howard Government and its connection  with the ‘children overboard’ affair. I mean, let’s remember the terminology ‘children  overboard’ in this country became synonymous with politicians not telling the truth. And that  happened during the 2001 election campaign, it happened when Mr Downer was Minister for  Foreign Affairs, when Mr Ruddock was Minister for Immigration. It just seems to me that Mr  Downer and others are back to those days.  

 JOURNALIST: Will Australia, if it’s asked by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,  accept some of the 250 Sri Lankan asylum seekers currently in Indonesia? 

 JULIA GILLARD: We are a nation that, each and every year, accepts refugees through  proper processes. We accept refugees from parts of the world where we talk to UNHCR and  we determine that we will take case load. There are obviously refugees in many parts of the  world who need assistance, and we work through proper processes to work out which parts of  the world we will take refugees from. 

 JOURNALIST: So that’s a chance, if the UNHCR says they’d like you to take some? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Well, the main thing here, I think, is for the Indonesian Government and  Indonesian authorities to deal with the issue of the boat in Indonesia. We won’t be changing  the arrangements that we have for the taking of refugees in view of this incident, and our  arrangements are clear. Our arrangements are that we take refugees, working with UNHCR,  from various parts of the globe and refugees who have been processed through proper  processes. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 JULIA GILLARD: I think that’s too long a bow for me. If you believe Mr Donnelly needs  to answer a question about a decision that he or others have made in their capacity as  members of the board of directors then I think you’d better address that to him. Okay, thank  you very much.
