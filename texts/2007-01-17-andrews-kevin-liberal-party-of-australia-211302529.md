 Tamworth opens its heart 

 17 January 2007 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone  today welcomed the Tamworth council's decision to accept refugees  as part of the Australian Government's programme of refugee  resettlement. 

 'We welcome the Tamworth Regional Council's decision overnight to  move forward and talk further about accepting refugees there,'  Senator Vanstone said today. 

 'Australia has a proud history of opening its heart to people in need,  and a big portion of that heart is in rural Australia. 

 'Many Australians don't realise that Australia is the second largest  acceptor of people in need of resettlement, as determined by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 

 'I'm delighted that the people of Tamworth, through their council,  have said they'll give it a go and be part of a wonderful programme. 

 'The council wants to talk to us and work through some concerns  they have with the programme, and we'll arrange for a high-level  delegation to work through with them right away the issues that have 

 and will be raised. 

 'We understand that change always brings concern and debate, but  we equally welcome Tamworth's willingness to give it a go. 

 'We look forward to discussions about how best to resettle some of  the refugees most suited to life in Tamworth. 

 'The history of migration to Australia shows that new groups arriving  here find a degree of uncertainty and questioning, but that we've  always been successful at helping them find their way and build new  lives here.' 

 Senator Vanstone said refugee resettlement takes place in every  capital city in Australia and fourteen regional areas across the  country including the likes of Coffs Harbour, Goulburn, Shepparton  and Mandurah.  

 'We're delighted that Tamworth will soon be on that list of regions  throwing down the welcome mat to newly arrived refugees.'
