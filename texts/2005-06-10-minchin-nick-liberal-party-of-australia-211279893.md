 AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APRIL 2005

 KEY POINTS

 â     The underlying cash balance for the 2004-05 year to 30 April 2005 was a surplus of $12,331 

 million compared with a surplus of $2,349 million to 31 March 2005.

 â     The fiscal balance for the 2004-05 year to 30 April 2005 was a surplus of $11,499 million 

 compared with a surplus of $1,608 million to 31 March 2005.

 â     The net operating result for the 2004-05 year to 30 April 2005 was a surplus of $9,394 million 

 compared with a deficit of $788 million to 31 March 2005.

 Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years and to full year  estimates. Revenue and expenses vary month-to-month and factors such as The New Tax System, and  the accrual framework including the timing of payments and policy decisions, can also have a large  impact on fiscal aggregates from one year to the next and on year-to-date outcomes.

 FISCAL OUTCOMES

 Underlying Cash Balance

 The main components of the underlying cash balance are cash from operations and cash movements  in the net investment in non-financial assets. 

 The underlying cash balance for the year to 30 April 2005 was a surplus of $12,331 million. This  underlying cash balance is $4,647 million higher than the April pro-rata (a surplus of $7,684 million)  of the 2004-05 Revised Budget estimate, in the 2005-06 Budget, of $9,221 million. The difference  reflects a number of individual variations including the following:

 Movements in underlying cash payments:

 Lower payments for: 

 â     Grants due to:

 â     underspends in several health programmes primarily:

 â      the National Public Health programme due to an increased lead time for 

 deliverables due to the need for more extensive consultation; â      the Medical Indemnity programme due to a lower than anticipated number of 

 doctors participating in the programme; â      the Ageing Support and Strategies programme delays in reports and contract 

 negotiations; and â      the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health programme due to a delay in 

 capital works and negotiating new funding agreements.

 â     lower claims for payments under several programmes including AusLink, Road Safety 

 Blackspots and the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements programmes. Payments are  lower than the pro-rata estimate as a result of delays in a number of projects across these  programmes.  Higher payments are expected later in the financial year; and

 â     Other lower payments due to timing of activities, requirements of partner Governments and 

 organisations, and the unpredictable nature of expenditure on emergencies for AusAID’s three  country and regional programs (PNG & Pacific; East Asia; and South Asia, Africa and Other)  as well as the Emergency, Humanitarian and Refugee Aid and NGO, Volunteer and  Community programs. These payments are incurred on an ad hoc basis. 

 Higher payments for:

 â     Non-government schools:

 â     Non-Government schools have now been paid 100 per cent of their full 2004-05 

 entitlements.  In line with usual practice, non-government schools were paid 50 per cent of their 2004-05 entitlement around August 2004, and the remaining 50 per cent in January 2005. This  is compared to a pro-rata 10/12 th estimate.

 Fiscal Balance

 The fiscal balance for the year to 30 April 2005 was a surplus of $11,499 million. The main  components of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating balance, which was a surplus of $11,486  million, and a net capital investment of $13 million for the year to 30 April 2005 (refer to the  Reconciliation of AAS Operating Result to Fiscal Balance on page 8 for further detail). 

 FINANCIAL OUTCOMES

 Actual expenses are $2,020 million lower when compared with a pro-rata of the Budget estimate. 

 The main reasons for the lower result, provided by function, are due to: 

 â     Health function - lower grants expenses primarily due to lower than expected spending in a 

 number of programmes including: National Public Health, Medical Indemnity programme,  Ageing Support and Strategies programme and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health:

 â     The National Public Health programme has lower than expected spending due to longer 

 than anticipated lead times relating to the delivery of the programme; â     The Medical Indemnity programme has a lower than anticipated number of doctors 

 participating; â     The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health programme has delays in capital 

 works; and â     The Ageing Support and Strategies programme has delays in reports and contract 

 negotiations.

 â     Transport function - lower expenses for several programmes including the AusLink and Roads 

 to Recovery programmes compared to pro-rata Revised Budget estimates. Higher payments  are expected later in the financial year. 

 Partially offset by: 

 â     Education function - higher expenses for education grants. The Ministerial determinations, 

 which create an expense for the full calendar year, were signed in December for higher  education institutions, and in January for non-government schools. In accordance with the  legislation, a large proportion of education grants are expensed between December and  February of each year. These grants are then gradually paid to institutions throughout the  calendar year. 

 Assets and Liabilities

 The net asset balance within the General Government sector is a negative net asset position of  $32,715 million at 30 April 2005.

 NOTES:

 The accounting policies in this part are generally consistent with the requirements of AAS. While the  scope for financial reporting recommended in AAS 31 is the whole of government (that is, the  Australian Government public sector), in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998,  this presentation covers the general government sector only. This publication does not include full  note disclosures. 

 With the introduction of Business Activity Statements and Instalment Activity Statements in 2000-2001, taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several types of tax when lodging  the statement and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known  with certainty at the end of each month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot  be finalised until all statements are received and processed. The outcomes for some revenue items  provided in this statement are thus estimates, in accordance with the best judgement of the Taxation  Commissioner, and subject to revision. The taxation revenue items not affected are: Petroleum  Resource Rent Tax, Excise duty, Customs duty, Other Taxes and Individuals Refunds. The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue  reported in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses. All taxation items in these notes are reported on a AAS basis, unless otherwise indicated.

 NOTE 1: INCOME TAX

 

 NOTE 2: INDIRECT TAX

 

 NOTE 3: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX

 In regard to GST revenue, AAS would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the  Australian Government’s Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of the  Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Australian Government-State Financial Relations is  that the GST is a State tax collected by the Australian Government in an agency capacity. Therefore,  accrued GST revenues and associated payments to the States and Territories are not disclosed in  these statements.

 

 NOTE 4: ADJUSTMENT FOR EDUCATION GRANT EXPENDITURE

 In regard to education grant expenditure, adherence to AAS results in few education expenses being  reported until the signing of the Ministerial determination, which normally occurs between  December and February each year. This produces a bunching of expenses such that the full year's  expense is recognised at that time and remains relatively constant until June. The table below  provides details of the cash paid by DEST and ANTA and attributable to the Education function for  the year to date.
