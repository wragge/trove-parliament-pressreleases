 |t e n t h  ANNIVERSARY o f  t e l e p h o n e  INTERPRETER s e r v i c e

 New «equipment incorporating the most.modern technology 

 would make the Telephone I n t e r p r e t e r S e r v i c e  (TIS) even more

 accessible to non-English speaking Australians within the next

 two y e a r s , the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic A f f a i r s ,

 ·> Mr Hodges was speaking on the tenth anniversary of TIS 

 which was set up simultaneously in Sydney and Melbourne.

 Since then, it has extended to 17 centres around Australia, 

 taking in all capital; cities and nine country r e g i o n s .

 ,  The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is 

 initiating moves to replace the present equipment with an 

 up-to-jlate computerised telephone end information system.

 "The Department also is investigating the most suitable 

 ^systems to make TIS easily accessible to all migrants in 

 'Australia for the cost of a local telephone call."

 Australia's migrants and r e f u g e e s ," Mr Hodges said.
