  The Hon. OR ANDREW THEOPHANOUS, M.H.R. 

  =ESERAL MEMBER FOR CAL’PJELL 

  PRIME MINISTER NOT ONLY IGNORES 

  UNITED NATIONS, BUT ALSO THE VIEWS OF   MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS 

  in j ustitication of his attack on the United Nations Treaty Committees,   Prirne Minister Howard has stated that the UN should allow Australians   to determine our own domestic human rights standards. However, his   decision to cease cooperation with United Nations Treaty Bodies also   shows a total disregard for the views of millions of Australian people. 

  In a Question without Notice this afternoon, the Independent Federal   Member for Calwell, Dr Andrew Theophanous, highlighted the enormous   concern from various Australian organisations in regard to the   Government’s stance on the United Nations Treaty bodies, and the   cot-xerns raised by these bodies, such as mandatory sentencing of 

  Indigenous people and mandatory detention of refugees. 

  In his question, Dr Theophanbus referred to the Human Rights and Equal   Opportunity Commission, the Refugee Council of Australia, and manv   Church and Community Groups that have all voiced their agreement with   the United Nations criticisms of the Australian Governmen; 

  Yet the answer supplied in Parliament by the Acting Prime Minister   displlayed a lack of any real interest in the views of Australian non-   govlxnment and community organisations. He failed to address this   important issue. 

  This Government is sliding closer and closer towards isolationism by its   complete lack of concern for any alternative views from both the United   Nations and important domestic organisations and community groups. 

  Dr Theophanous calls on the Howard Government to give these   organisations the respect they deserve, and at the very least, to conside   the views of the Australian people they are supposed t6 be representing.
