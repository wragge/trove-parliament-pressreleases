 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 10 September 2014   

 TPVs: Morrison’s desperate distraction from  offshore failure   

 Today’s admission from the Immigration Minister that he will process the claims of refugees who  have arrived in Australia after July 19 2013 is a clear admission that offshore processing has  collapsed, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Offshore processing is unworkable and, finally, the jig is up,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “Dumping the government’s commitment to offshore processing like this is a major policy  backflip on the back of a major policy failure.   

 “Until now there was an arbitrary date that decided where people will be dumped, but this  announcement has left that in doubt. The lottery has become even shoddier and no one knows  the odds.   

 “The Abbott government has conceded that it has to process these people’s claims in Australia  and is simply using TPVs as a distraction.   

 “This isn’t about the Senate and TPVs, this is about the government realising offshore  processing has fallen apart.   

 “There are over 200 children on Nauru who are suffering every day. The Minister needs to bring  these children and their families to Australia so that they can have their claims processed like  everyone else.”
