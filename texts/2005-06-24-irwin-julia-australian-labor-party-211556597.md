 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Irwin Supports Easing Mandatory Detention  24th June 2005 

 Federal Member for Fowler, Julia Irwin, told Parliament last week that she  supported the move by the Howard government to soften Australia’s asylum-seeker policies. 

 But, she said, the Pacific solution was still “a sorry chapter in Australia’s  history of overseas detention” which had “more to do with vote-catching votes  than with catching people-smugglers.” 

 She said that Liberal MP Petro Georgiou ? the leader of a group of  government MPs who successfully lobbied the prime minister for changes to  mandatory detention ? had been silent until only four months ago despite  having been in parliament for the past 12 years which saw the arrival of the  Tampa and the sinking of the boat identified as SIEVX which resulted in the  loss of over 350 lives in 2002. 

 The changes to the migration laws include the transfer of families with  children  from detention centres to “community” detention, a new “removal  pending” visa for long-term asylum seekers in detention and the review by the  Commonwealth Ombudsman of all cases where people have been kept in  detention for two years or more.
