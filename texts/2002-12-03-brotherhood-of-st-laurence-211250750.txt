  ALP immigration policy in line with new study:   Seeking asylum: Living with fear, uncertainty and exclusion 

  The Brotherhood of St Laurence (BSL) today welcomed the revised ALP immigration   policy the same day it launched the study, Seeking asylum: Living with fear, uncetiainfy   and exclusion. 

  The study captures the experience of 40 asylum seekers adversely affected by   government policy. It shows they are refused work rights at the same time they are   denied any way of getting food, housing or assistance. 

  “We found that many asylum seekers and refugees live in deep financial hardship, with   unacceptable levels of uncertainty and fear because they don’t get the support they   need. These people are already traumatised,” said Ainslie Hannan, researcher and   coordinator of the Ecumenical Migration Centre of the Brotherhood of St Laurence. 

  The BSL took twelve months to compete the study, which uses purposeful sampling to   ensure that unheard voices would speak for themselves. 

  “We arrived here in fear. We are refugees - we live in fear, ” one of the participants said.   “They won’f give me work permission since I have been in Ausfralia, ” said Mikal, from   the Middle East, Asked if he received financial assistance from the government, he said   “No, no fhing. So 1 somefimes have fo borrow shoes from my friend fo go somewhere. ” 

  The BSL welcomed the ALP’s commitment to quicker processing and just one appeal.   “A new Refugee Status Determination Tribunal with three members instead of one is a   move in the right direction to a more informed 

  and just process”, says MS Hannan. 

  “The appointment of case workers ensures that asylum seekers are kept informed and   linked into humanitarian care systems.” 

  The BSL looks forward to consulting with both sides of government in the future. “Like   many other agencies we find ourselves picking up the pieces left behind by government   policy,” says MS Hannan. 

  Despite possible improvements in the future, 112 children remain in detention today.
