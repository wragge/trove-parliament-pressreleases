 Refugee Appeal Success Shows Why Anti-refugee Bills Should be Rejected

 News that the 43rd and final asylum seeker who arrived from West Papua in January has had his  refugee claim approved by the Refugee Review Tribunal shows that an independent umpire on refugee  claims is essential, Democrats Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett said today.   

 "The original decision to deny this man's claim because his sister was on a study visa in Japan was  ludicrous."   

 "You could not get a simpler example of why there has to be an independent mechanism to review  decisions by the Government when it refuses refugee claims," Senator Bartlett said.    

 "This process is precisely what asylum seekers have not had when they have been locked up in Nauru."   

 "I hope this decision provides the obvious reason for some Liberal Senators to knock back the  Government's anti-refugee legislation, which is still sitting in the wings and which would prevent more  people from being able to access this independent review mechanism."    

 "If this man had been sent to Nauru as the Federal Government now wants to do, he would still be stuck  there, just as many others were stuck on Nauru for years before political and public pressure forced  some action."   

 "No half-baked pretend review of cases on Nauru can substitute for a proper legally based and  enforceable mechanism," Senator Bartlett said.
