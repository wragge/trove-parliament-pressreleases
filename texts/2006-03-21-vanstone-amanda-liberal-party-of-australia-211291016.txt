 Minister Opens Harmony Day Expo in Adelaide

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, today marked Harmony Day by officially opening an expo at the Adelaide  Secondary School of English (ASSoE) in Croydon.

 ‘The ASSoE is a highly appropriate place to celebrate Harmony Day as there are approximately 55 nationalities and 47 languages represented at  the school,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘More than 60 percent of the students are former refugees who came to Australia under our generous humanitarian program.

 ‘The expo showcases the school’s cultural diversity and its strong commitment to promoting racial tolerance in the school and community.

 ‘The expo is the highlight of a joint project between the Croydon High School and the ASSoE funded by a grant of $50 000 from the Living in  Harmony program of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

 ‘The project seeks to address racism in schools and in the wider community by supporting students, staff and parents to work with outside  agencies, community and sporting groups, to promote cross cultural understanding,’ the Minister said.

 ASSoE offers an intensive English language program for students aged 12-18 who are newly arrived in Australia. The students are prepared for  successful integration into mainstream high schools, further education and training.

 Now in its eighth year, Harmony Day has become Australia’s most significant multicultural event and falls on the same day as the United Nations  International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

 ‘Today is a day to celebrate the many steps Australia has taken to free itself from discrimination and racial hatred, but also a day to reflect on the  challenges that remain and to renew our commitment to overcoming them,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our values include respect for the rights of the individual, tolerance of differences, a commitment to the country’s laws, the equality of men and  women and the ‘fair go’ attitude that is about acceptance, fair play and compassion for those in need.

 ‘Australia’s humanitarian program provides 6000 refugee and 7000 humanitarian places each year, putting Australia in the top three countries  (along with US and Canada) that provide a permanent humanitarian resettlement programme.’

 The Harmony Day Expo will be held at Adelaide Secondary School of English.  253 Torrens Road, West Croydon, Metro West, Adelaide, 11am - 12pm.
