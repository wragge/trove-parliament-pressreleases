 GREATER RESPECT FOR

 INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW NEEDED SAYS MINISTER FOR  JUSTICE

 All nations need to co-ordinate greater respect for and compliance with international  humanitarian law, the Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, said today at the opening of  the Second Regional Conference on International Humanitarian Law at the Australian  Defence Studies Centre, Canberra.

 “At the start of this century, 90 per cent of war casualties were military, while now at  the end of the century, 90 per cent are civilian casualties. Instead of large-scale  international wars, we are now seeing more bitter, localised conflicts over deeply-felt  nationalist, ethnic, religious and political issues,” said Mr Kerr.

 “Ironically and tragically, as the need for international humanitarian laws to work  effectively has increased, respect for them seems to have decreased. These laws limit  the use of violence in times of armed conflict by, for example, giving protection to  civilians and prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions and Protocols.

 “Even war should have basic rules of decency and compassion.”

 Mr Kerr singled out anti-personnel landmines as being particularly abhorrent because  of their widespread use and indiscriminate impact on civilians, particularly children.

 “We have all seen distressing images in the media of children with horrific injuries  because they chose to play in the wrong spot,” Mr Kerr said.

 “The Australian Government accepts that landmines are used as conventional  weapons, but is concerned with their appalling human toll. Limitations are proposed  by Australia on their manufacture, stockpiling, trade, operation and use. It is possible,  for example, to make these mines self-neutralising, so that they do not linger  dangerously for up to 50 years.”
