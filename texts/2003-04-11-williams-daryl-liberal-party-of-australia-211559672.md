 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON DARYL WILLIAMS AM QC MP 

 

 NEWS RELEASE   

 11 April 2003 41/03 

 SIX MORE GROUPS LISTED AS TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS   

 The Howard Government has today gazetted regulations listing Asbat al-Ansar,  Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Islamic Army of Aden, the Islamic Movement of  Uzbekistan, Jaish-i-Mohammed and Lashkar i Jhangvi as terrorist organisations  under counter-terrorism laws passed last year. 

 The listing of these groups as terrorist organisations will serve to deter Australians  from becoming involved in their activities. 

 It will also strengthen Australia’s ability to prosecute related offences under our  counter-terrorism laws, which make it an offence to belong to, direct, recruit for,  train with or provide training for, and receive funds from or make funds available to  a terrorist organisation, whether in Australia or abroad. These offences carry  penalties of up to 25 years imprisonment. 

 The regulations follow listings of each of these groups as terrorist organisations by  the United Nations Security Council and recommendations by the Attorney-General’s Department and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.  

 The regulations will take effect immediately. 

 Under Australian law, in order to list a group as a terrorist organisation, the  Attorney-General must first be satisfied that the organisation has been identified by  the UN Security Council in a decision relating wholly or partly to terrorism, or in a  mechanism under such a decision. 

 The requirement to wait for a UN Security Council listing - which unfortunately  prevents Australia from acting independently to list a terrorist organisation - was the  result of Opposition amendments to the Government’s counter-terrorism legislation,  passed by the Parliament last July. 

 In addition to the requirement that the United Nations must first list an organisation,  the Attorney-General must also be satisfied that the organisation is engaged in,  preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. I am  satisfied that the conditions for listing these organisations have been met under  Australian law.

 Asbat al-Ansar / Usbat al-Ansar 

 

 Asbat al-Ansar (League of Partisans aka Usbat al-Ansar) is a Lebanon-based Sunni  Islamic extremist group which follows the same fundamentalist interpretation of  Islam as al-Qaida, with which it is affiliated.  

 Asbat al-Ansar was established in the early 1990s and is primarily based in the Ayn  al-Hilwah Palestinian refugee camp near Sidon in southern Lebanon. To date, Asbat  al-Ansar’s area of operations has been limited to Lebanon. 

 Asbat al-Ansar is led by Ahmed Abdul Karim Al Saadi (also known as Abu  Muhjen/Abu Mahjen). Al Saadi has been sentenced to death by the Lebanese  authorities for the murder of Sheikh Nizar al Halabi, the former leader of the Islamic  Charity Projects Association (also known as the Ahbash movement).  

 Asbat al-Ansar seeks to establish a radical Sunni Islamic state in Lebanon. Its goals  include overthrowing the Lebanese government and thwarting anti-Islamic  influences in Lebanon.  

 It is reported that Asbat al-Ansar is affiliated with the international al-Qaida  network, from which it has received funding. Asbat al-Ansar sent fighters to  Chechnya to fight against Russia. 

 Since the early 1990s, Asbat al-Ansar has conducted numerous low-level attacks and  bombings against targets inside Lebanon it regards as ‘un-Islamic’, such as churches,  bars, theatres and casinos. It has also been involved in numerous murders of rival  Palestinian and Islamic group members.  

 Terrorist acts for which responsibility has been reliably attributed to Asbat al-Ansar  include:   

 â¢ assassinations of Lebanese religious leaders and the bombing of several  nightclubs, theatres and liquor stores in the mid 1990s; 

 â¢ an attack on a court in Sidon in 1999;  

 â¢ a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the Russian embassy in Beirut in January  2000, killing one Lebanese policeman and injuring seven; 

 â¢ the bombing of a church in Sidon on 17 October 2001, causing material damage  but no casualties; and 

 â¢ a series of grenade attacks on army posts in Sidon and arson and bomb attacks on  churches in northern and southern Lebanon.  

 It is assessed that Asbat al-Ansar remains actively engaged in preparing and  planning for terrorist acts against Western interests, primarily in Lebanon.

 Al-Jihad / Egyptian Islamic Jihad 

 

 EIJ formed in the 1970s as a coalition of like-minded groups with the common  objective of replacing the secular Egyptian government with an Islamic state.  Although this remains the primary objective of the organisation, it also supports the  broader international goals of the al-Qaida network of terrorist organisations, and a  number of EIJ members are openly aligned with the al-Qaida network. In pursuit of  these aims EIJ espouses an Islamic extremist ideology, including advocating and  undertaking acts of violence against Egyptian interests in Egypt and internationally. 

 EIJ has a worldwide network of members and supporters, including in Afghanistan,  Lebanon, Pakistan, Sudan, UK and Yemen. 

 During the 1990s members of the EIJ leadership group, drew close to al-Qaida. In  1998, a statement was published declaring the founding of the International Islamic  Front for Jihad on the Jews and Crusaders. This umbrella organisation draws  together EIJ, al-Qaida and other militant Islamic groups.  

 The EIJ has recruited individuals with skills in forgery, military operations and  marksmanship. Many EIJ members have received training at camps that also have  provided training to al-Qaida recruits. EIJ members have received training in  terrorist related skills including the manufacture, use, and smuggling of explosives  and assassinations. 

 Major terrorist attacks which have been reliably attributed to EIJ or for which EIJ has  claimed responsibility have included: 

 â¢ the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in October 1981; 

 â¢ attempts to assassinate the Egyptian Prime Minister, and the Egyptian Interior  Minister in 1993; 

 â¢ the assassination of an Egyptian diplomat in Geneva in November 1995; 

 â¢ a suicide truck-bomb attack on 19 November 1995 against the Egyptian embassy  in Pakistan, killing 17 people; and 

 â¢ the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on 7 August 1998,  killing over 200 people, as well as plans for an attack on the US embassy in  Albania the same year. 

 EIJ has demonstrated a long term commitment to the use of violence in pursuit of its  objectives. The close association between elements of the EIJ’s leadership and other  groups within the al-Qaida network means that the organisation may draw upon  significant material support from Osama bin Laden in relation to its future activities.

 Islamic Army of Aden 

 

 The Islamic Army of Aden (IAA) is a Sunni Islamic group that is believed to have  developed in Yemen in the early 1990s. 

 At that time, members of what was to become the IAA were involved in a series of  attacks against the US Embassy and hotels where US forces were staying, aimed at  forcing the US to withdraw its support base in Yemen for operations in Somalia. 

 The IAA operates in Southern Yemen, primarily in the governorates of Aden and  Abyan, and is committed to overthrowing the Yemeni government and establishing  an Islamic state in Yemen. It also seeks to remove all Western interests from Yemen  and the wider Middle East. 

 The IAA is connected with al-Qaida and has released public communiquÃ©s in  support of Osama Bin Laden, al-Qaida and its terrorist activities. 

 It has received financial and probably wider material support from Osama Bin Laden  and al-Qaida in return for their public support. 

 The IAA has been responsible for a series of bomb attacks and kidnappings,  including of Australian, US and UK citizens, in the pursuit of its objectives. 

 Major terrorist activities for which IAA has claimed responsibility for or for which  responsibility has been reliably attributed to the IAA, include: 

 â¢ two bomb attacks in the city of Abyan during October 1998; 

 â¢ the planning of an attack against the UK Consulate, an Anglican church and two  hotels in Yemen in December 1998; 

 â¢ the kidnapping of 16 tourists including UK, Australian and US citizens in Yemen  on 28 December 1998, which resulted in the deaths of four tourists, including an  Australian; 

 â¢ the issuing of threats of violence against UK and US Ambassadors and other  foreigners in Yemen including western doctors and tourists on 7 March 1999; 

 â¢ the suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole on 12 October 2000 in Yemen,  killing 17 US sailors;  

 â¢ a Molotov cocktail attack against the US Embassy in Yemen on 13 October 2000,  which caused minor damage; 

 â¢ the bombing of a building belonging to the Anglican church in Aden and the  firing of a rocket propelled grenade at the Yemen-Intercontinental Hotel in  Kharmaksar, Yemen in 2001. 

 IAA is assessed to be continuing to plan acts of violence with a view to furthering its  political and religious objectives.

 Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan 

 

 The IMU, which is also known as the Islamic Party of Turkestan, was founded in  1997. It is a coalition of Islamic militants from Uzbekistan and other Central Asian  states who oppose the current Uzbek regime.  

 The IMU’s area of operation is primarily Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and  Kyrgyzstan. The group’s tactics include taking of hostages (including of foreigners),  assassination and car bombings. 

 The IMU formed close ties with al-Qaida and the former Taliban government. IMU  fighters have trained in camps in Afghanistan, some controlled by Osama bin Laden.  

 IMU members have been trained by al-Qaida instructors in guerrilla warfare,  sabotage, bomb making, assassination and urban terrorism. The IMU has also  received funding from al-Qaida.  

 The IMU has been responsible for a series of attacks and kidnappings, including of  US citizens, in the pursuit of its objectives. In October 1999 the Uzbek government  attributed responsibility for 19 murders and 35 significant acts of terrorism to the  IMU.  

 Major terrorist acts for which responsibility has been reliably attributed to the IMU  include: 

 â¢ five car bomb attacks in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in February 1999 in which 13  people were killed and over 100 injured; 

 â¢ the attempted assassination of  Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan, in  February 1999; 

 â¢ the seizure of four villages in southern Kyrgyz in August 1999 and taking more  than 300 hostages, including four Japanese geologists for ransom;  

 â¢ taking four US citizens hostage in August 2000, (the hostages subsequently  escaped); 

 â¢ two major attacks against the southern border of Uzbekistan in Mid 2000; and 

 â¢ engaged in fighting alongside the Taliban and al-Qaida against Coalition forces in  Afghanistan in 2002. 

 It is assessed that the IMU is continuing to prepare, plan, assist and foster the  conduct of further terrorist acts.

 Jaish-i-Mohammed / Jaish-e-Mohammed   

 JEM is a militant Sunni Islamic group founded in Pakistan. It is based in Pakistan,  primarily in Preshawar and Muzaffarabad. The group is active in India and the  Kashmir region. JEM also maintained a presence in Afghanistan until the US led  ‘War on Terror’. 

 JEM is closely associated with a number of militant Islamic groups active in the  India/Pakistan region, including Lashkar i Jhangvi (LJ) and Harkut ul-Jihad-i-Islam  (HUJI), as well as al-Qaida. JEM nevertheless continues to exist as a distinct entity  and retains an operational capability in its own right.  

 JEM draws substantial resources from Harakat ul-Mujahideen (HUM). HUM was a  signatory to Osama bin Laden’s ‘International Front for Jihad’ against the US and  Israel and on 14 November 2002, it was specified by regulation as a terrorist  organisation for the purposes of the Criminal Code.  

 JEM aims to unite the Indian-administered area of Kashmir with Pakistan and  ultimately establish an Islamic state within Pakistan itself.  

 JEM supporters have access to a range of weaponry including machine guns, assault  rifles, mortars, improvised explosive devices and rocket grenades, largely sourced  through HUM.  

 Major terrorist activities for which JEM has claimed responsibility, or for which  responsibility has been reliably attributed to JEM, include: 

 â¢ a suicide car bomb attack on an Indian military base in Kashmir in April 2000. 

 â¢ the murders of three policemen in Srinagar, India in June 2000; 

 â¢ a suicide bomb attack outside the State Legislative Assembly building in Srinagar  in October 2001, killing 31 people; 

 â¢ an attack, in conjunction with Lashkar-e-Taiba, on the Indian Parliament in New  Delhi in December 2002, killing nine  people and injuring 18; 

 â¢ the kidnapping and killing, in conjunction with LJ, of US journalist Daniel Pearl  in January 2002 for which JEM founding member, Sheikh Ahmed Omar Sayeed,  was subsequently found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment; 

 â¢ a car bomb attack, in conjunction with LJ and HUJI members, on the US  Consulate General in Karachi in June 2002 which resulted in the death of 11  Pakistanis; and 

 â¢ the massacre of 24 Hindu Kashmiri in the Pulwama district of Kashmir in  conjunction with Lashkar-e-Taiba members in March 2003.

 Lashkar i Jhangvi (LJ) 

 

 Lashkar i Jhangvi is a Sunni Islamic group based in Pakistan in both Karachi and the  Punjab region. Members of the LJ also maintained a presence in Afghanistan until  they were forced into the tribal areas of Pakistan following the fall of the Taliban. 

 LJ has close ties to other militant Kashmiri groups including Jaish-i-Mohammed  (JEM) and Harkut ul-Jihad-i-Islam (HUJI). LJ continues to exist as a distinct entity  within the coalition and retains an operational capability in its own right. Its primary  goal is to establish a Sunni Islamic state in Pakistan. It is estimated to have 300 active  supporters.  

 LJ has confirmed links with al-Qaida and the Taliban. Prior to the fall of the Taliban,  LJ members were given sanctuary in Afghanistan from Pakistani authorities. Al-Qaida has provided LJ with training and is also credited with enhancing LJ’s  technical capability, providing them with the skills to undertake suicide bomb  attacks.  

 Terrorist incidents for which LJ has claimed responsibility, or for which  responsibility has been reliably attributed to LJ include: 

 â¢ the killing of four US oil workers in Karachi in 1997; 

 â¢ the Lahore Mominpura Cemetery massacre in 1999 in which 25 Shi’a Muslims  were killed;  

 â¢ the attempted assassination of then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in  1999; 

 â¢ the killing of 15 Christians and a Muslim policeman in an attack on a church in  Bahawalpur, Pakistan on 28 October 2001; 

 â¢ the kidnapping and killing of US journalist Daniel Pearl in January 2002, which LJ  conducted in alliance with JEM; 

 â¢ the bombing of a church in March 2002, killing two US citizens;  

 â¢ a suicide car bombing of a Pakistani Navy bus on 8 May 2002, killing 14 people;  

 â¢ a car bomb attack, in conjunction with JEM and HUJI members, on the US  Consulate General in Karachi in June 2002, killing 11 Pakistanis;  

 â¢ an attack on a Shi’a Medhi Mosque in Karachi on 22 February 2003, killing nine;  and 

 â¢ the killing of nine Shi’a Muslims in Karachi on 11 March 2003, in respect of which  one LJ member has been arrested by Pakistani authorities.
