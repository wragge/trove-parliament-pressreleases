 LABOR'S TENT CITY ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND AS ANOTHER BOAT ARRIVES 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today the Rudd Government will preside 

 over a tent city on Christmas Island as their failed policies have resulted in the 62nd boat arrival since they 

 started fiddling with the thermostat on border protection.  

 “Kevin Rudd’s failures on border protection have now seen 62 boats arrive and 2740 desperate people putting 

 their lives at risk since August 2008,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “For the second time, this latest boat, carrying 60 people, is reported to have arrived at Christmas Island without 

 being intercepted,” he said.  

 “Now Christmas Island, once dubbed a ‘white-elephant’ by Labor, is crowded and over capacity and the 

 government will build a tent city to house new arrivals.  

 "Asylum seekers will spend a long hot summer under tents on Christmas Island, with additional facilities not 

 expected to be in place until March next year, at least.  

 “This should be a massive wake-up call for the Rudd Government to get serious about its failed border protection 

 policies. Kevin Rudd must admit this is a mess of his own creation and take responsibility for his failed policies.  

 “Erecting tents and demountables is no solution. Kevin Rudd needs to stop the boats. In Government the 

 Coalition reduced the boats to zero. It seems the only way Australia can now send a strong message to people 

 smugglers is to elect an Abbott led Coalition Government.  

 “The Rudd Government's tent city solution is a blatant demonstration of Labor's failure on border protection, yet 

 they still seem to have their head stuck in the sand.  

 “It poses a further risk that the Rudd Government will consider landing asylum seekers on the mainland once 

 Christmas Island becomes too crowded.  

 “That will raise a whole new set of legal implications for Australia and for the status of people being thrust 

 towards our waters by money-hungry people smugglers.”  

 Mr Morrison said there is now immense pressure on the Rudd Government to come clean and say what exactly it 

 plans to do with further boat arrivals.  

 “More tents is simply not an answer. The first step is for Labor to accept there are ‘pull factors’ of their own 

 making which are drawing continued people smuggling activity, destination Australia,” he said.  

 “This will continue to be the case while the Prime Minister remains in a state of denial over the outcomes of his 

 own actions in tinkering with successful border protection measures set down by the Howard Government.  

 “Australians will judge Mr Rudd on what he does, not what he says. He cannot spin these boats or the people 

 smugglers away,” Mr Morrison said.
