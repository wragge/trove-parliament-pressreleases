  6 April 1999

  TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER

  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP

  PRESS CONFERENCE - PARLIAMENT HOUSE

  

  E&OE

  

  Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve called this news conference with Mr Ruddock 
to announce to announce a number of decisions that the  Government 
has taken today in response to the appalling human tragedy that is unfolding 
in Europe particularly in the wake of the forced expulsion as an act 
of racial persecution by the forces of President Milosevic of hundreds 
of thousands of Albanians who are now trapped in a most distressing 
human situation. There are some varying estimates but there’s not 
much doubt that we are talking about 300,000 to 400,000 people at the 
very least who have been displaced from their homes. It is a humanitarian 
crisis of immense proportions and one that is likely to get a lot worse.

  

 Australia geographically, of course, is a long way 
from Yugoslavia but the Government does not believe that in the circumstances 
it would be appropriate for Australia to rely on geographic distance 
as an excuse for not doing more. We have already announced a contribution 
of $2 million to humanitarian organisations working in the region including 
to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, CARE Australia, 
the Red Cross and World Vision. The Cabinet has decided today to increase 
that contribution by another $4 million to a total of $6 million and 
the assistance will go towards meeting the urgent relief needs of displaced 
people in Albania, Macedonia and other surrounding countries.

  

 But more importantly the Government has decided that 
Australia should play its role in the international effort to relieve 
the burden on neighbouring states and we have decided to provide within 
Australia’s safe haven for up to 4,000 people displaced from Kosovo 
on a temporary basis until the situation on the ground improves. It 
will be for an initial period of three months depending - and that’ll 
be renewable - depending on the circumstances as they unfold in Kosovo. 
I do want to emphasise that this is a purely temporary measure. Our 
main aim must be to see these people returned to their homes, their 
villages and hamlets in Kosovo as soon as possible.

  

 This decision by the Government is taken as a special 
measure. It is to be seen as separate and apart from the normal immigration 
and refugee programme. It is conditional on one very important consideration 
and that is the passage of legislation by the Federal Parliament with 
effect from today, establishing a situation where none of the 4,000 
people will be able to initiate any action within Australia for a change 
of status. They will not be entitled to seek while in Australia any 
change of status. The intention is that they will be provided with accommodation, 
with food, the basic necessities of life and health care. In the nature 
of an emergency operation such as this it would be necessary for these 
people to be received and looked after in perhaps some defence installations. 
We have already initiated an urgent assessment of available temporary 
accommodation and we are, of course, willing to naturally bear the full 
cost of bringing people to Australia. They are to be here as a special 
category of displaced people with the intention that they should return. 
The passage of that legislation is a pre-condition or an agreement for 
the passage of the legislation rather it is a condition of the implementation 
of decision.

  

 I have spoken to Mr Beazley the Leader of the Opposition 
this afternoon. He has indicated strong support for the Government’s 
decision and an in-principle commitment to support the passage of the 
legislation through the Federal Parliament. I welcome that expression 
of support from Mr Beazley. Humanitarian responses of this kind ought 
as far as possible to be conducted on a bi-partisan basis.

  

 I want to emphasise to you, ladies and gentlemen, 
that this is a humanitarian disaster, a human tragedy beyond the normal 
tragedies and developments to which we have almost become numbed over 
the years. The movement of populations is the greatest, I understand, 
in the experience of Europe since World War II. The behaviour of the 
Milosevic forces which have engaged in acts of racial persecution are 
quite unacceptable. The Government believes that despite the fact that 
we are not part of NATO and we are not involved in any way, of course, 
with the military action that we do have a responsibility on humanitarian 
grounds to participate in the relief of suffering of such a magnitude.

  

  Australia has a very long and proud record of providing a humanitarian 
response to the mass uprooting and movements of populations around the 
world and this is very much of a peace with those responses. It is the 
sort of response that I believe the Austra lian public expects 
of its Government but more importantly than that it is the right response 
because this is a terrible tragedy and even though it is a long way 
from Australia we have to play our part.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 [inaudible]…what’s changed the Government’s 
thinking?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well let me something. Mr Ruddock will no doubt say 
something about that as well. But what Mr Ruddock said yesterday was 
utterly consistent with the Government’s immigration policy. And indeed 
one matter that I did not mention was to reconfirm that Mr Ruddock’s 
earlier indication that in recognition of the grave situation on the 
ground Australia is prepared to extend the visas of the estimated 2,000 
visitors from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on a case by case basis. 
What Mr Ruddock said yesterday was utterly consistent with the Government’s 
position and policy. This is a special response to a particular situation 
which should be seen separately and apart from, and in addition to, 
the normal refugee and humanitarian response programme.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 [inaudible]…Mr Ruddock said they would not go back 
after the temporary status.

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 I beg your pardon.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Ruddock argued that people on temporary status 
were unlikely to go back.

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

  We ll I haven’t read every single thing Mr Ruddock has said 
and Mr Ruddock will no doubt speak for himself. But what is important 
is that the Cabinet has looked at this whole situation and has decided, 
quite properly in my view, that a special response in all of the circumstances 
is needed. Now everything that Mr Ruddock said in relation to the normal 
operation of the immigration programme was utterly consistent with Government 
policy. And I completely endorse in every way his handling of the situation. 
We had a discussion about it, we thought about it long and hard, and 
we decided that this was the right thing to do. Now if you want to spend 
the next half an hour asking me questions about what Mr Ruddock said, 
or thought, or I did before today, well you go ahead. But I tell you 
what, I won’t be here to answer them because I think the quality of 
the decision and the appropriateness of the decision that had been taken 
is the right thing.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Can I just ask, how are these people physically going 
to get here? Are Australian RAAF planes going to be involved, and how 
soon do you expect the first people to arrive?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well Tony, I can only say in response to that that 
people are working away furiously now to make those arrangements. I 
can’t answer all of that now. Just a moment Aban. I can’t answer 
that. All I can say to you is that we’ve taken this decision, I’ve 
outlined the basis of the decision. We’ve now asked all of our advisers 
to prepare a detailed game plan. Clearly there will be, I imagine, involved 
the chartering of aircraft, the use of all available aircraft. We’ve 
got to work out appropriate procedures for selection. There are a million 
and one things that will need to be done. The important thing is that 
we are indicating to the Australian people, and we’re indicating to 
the world a willingness to help. And that will make a small contribution 
to I hope improving the spirits and improving the sense of hope and 
relieving the sense of despair which is no doubt being experienced by 
these hundreds of thousands of unfortunate human beings. This is something 
where a nation of Australia’s strength and wealth, and comparative 
affluence has an overwhelming moral obligation to play a part in. That’s 
why we’ve taken the decision and it’s the right decision. As to 
all the details of it, I can’t answer your question. I don’t know 
yet. We’ve got to work many of those details out. I’m sure with 
the support of the Opposition, the goodwill of the Opposition, and I 
hope the goodwill of the Australian community and people who support 
humanitarian responses that we’ll be able to get the job done and 
get it done quickly. We obviously need to act as speedily as possible. 
We know there’s a cost involved. It’s a cost worth incurring because 
there’s a humanitarian response involved.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Howard, can these people be kept under some form 
of restraint, I mean, effective captivity so that they don’t just 
scatter in the community?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well look, initially, Peter, they’ll obviously have 
to go to, you know, arrival centres around the country. There’ll need 
to be health checks and so forth. The question of their future movements 
away from the initial reception areas, that is something that we’re 
giving consideration to and we’re seeking advice on. You can’t resolve 
all of these matters in the space of a few hours. You do need to get 
advice. They are to be seen as not as part of the normal immigration 
programme. And I think if you look at what the Americans are doing and 
many of the other countries are doing, I think the Americans are, so 
I’ve been informed, are going to receive them on the Guantanamo Naval 
Base in Cuba and also at Guam. They’re making special arrangements. 
We will give a broadly similar response. The aim of the exercise is 
to provide a safe haven. The aim of the exercise is to give to these 
people some sense of physical security, sustenance, but not to do it 
in a way that relieves the international political pressure on Milosevic. 
And one of the criticisms that could be made of the automatic inclusion 
of these 4000 people in the normal refugee programme would be that it 
would signal that Milosevic had won and that he had succeeded in expelling 
these people from their own country. We think this is the appropriate 
humanitarian response which falls short of conceding political ground 
to Milosevic.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Do you have any concerns, Prime Minister, that it 
might lead to racial conflict here in Australia?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well, I don’t think it will lead to racial conflict 
here in Australia. Australians are humanitarian people. I think, if 
people look at things from an Australian national interest point of 
view, we have decided to do this because it’s the right thing for 
Australia to do. We think that this country has a moral obligation to 
play its part. I don’t believe it will lead to racial conflict. And 
I can just say again that Australia respects very much the right of 
people of all origins to honour their heritage and preserve their culture. 
It never respects the right of people to bring overseas hatreds and 
bitternesses into this country wherever those hatreds or bitternesses 
come from.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Did you discuss today’s decision with any other 
leaders in NATO or the US?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 No, no. It is not in response to any request. It is 
a decision which has been generated by the Australian Government of 
its own volition, according to our assessment of what Australia ought 
to be doing. I have not received any request and I’m not aware that 
Mr Ruddock or Mr Downer has received any request from any foreign country. 
We think it’s the right thing for Australia to be doing and that’s 
why we’ve taken the decision.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What about the time the Government has [inaudible] 
of the situation not being resolved in the Balkan in the three-month 
period?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well, let’s take one thing at a time. I’ve announced 
the decision. I’ve explained the context in which the decision has 
been taken. And what I am saying and what I’m doing, as I understand 
it, is no different from the way in which Mr Blair and President Clinton 
and others are responding to like questions. I mean, our response in 
concept is broadly similar to that of the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Germany and a number of other European countries.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  What they said about Ti annamen Square when Mr Hawke made his 
decision — one thing at a time — but isn’t the question that was 
on your Immigration Minister’s mind yesterday, what happens after 
three months or, you know, is there an upper limit to the time that 
you permit these people to stay?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well, I am simply not even going to try and answer 
that question, not even try. It is altogether too, it’s too calculated, 
that’s too considered and calculated a question. I mean, you’ve 
got a humanitarian crisis. You’ve got a flood of humanity coming across 
borders in the most appalling circumstances and you are a relatively 
affluent, very peaceful, very stable, very endowed, very lucky country. 
You have a moral obligation to put your hand up and say to the rest 
of the world, we are prepared to take our share and to play our part. 
There will be problems. There will be difficulties. People will criticise 
the decision. After a while people will get impatient and they’ll 
say you should have done this and you should have done that. I know 
all of that and you’ll be back with all sorts of questions. But it 
is the right thing to do. And we’ll deal with three months in three 
months time.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 In relation to President Milosevic, isn’t there 
a situation where you intend to repatriate those people and if you can’t, 
then he has won.

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Matt, I’m not going to answer a whole series of 
hypothetical questions.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 You’ve said there’s no upper limit here, but do 
you have reason...

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 No upper limit?

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Well, you’ve said that it can be renewed after three 
months and presumably Kosovo won’t be actually solved within three 
months...

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well, I’m not prepared to speculate about what the 
situation will be in three weeks let alone three months. So you may 
be able to predict it but I’m not going to try to.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 My question was, really, was if Kosovo hasn’t been 
solved to the point where Albanians can go back and live there, will 
these people be shunted off somewhere else down the track?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 I’m not going to speculate about that. I’m really 
not. Except to make the point that the decision that we’ve taken today 
can hardly be categorised as lacking humanity. It’s a compassionate, 
fair, decent decision. And you can be certain that this Government, 
in these matters, will always act in a compassionate, fair and decent 
fashion but also with a healthy and firm regard to the Australian national 
interest, which is why the whole proposition is conditional on the passage 
of that legislation with effect from today which Mr Beazley has told 
me this afternoon on the phone the Labor Party will support.

  

 Thank you.
