 PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ORIENTAL HOTEL, 22 NOVEMBER 1983

 PM: Ladies and Gentlemen, I will start by going over - for the benefit of the non-Australian contingent - an outline  that I gave to them yesterday of the talks that Foreign  Minister, Bill Hayden and I had with the Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister of Thailand and then add some further  .  comments to that. â 

 In those discussions yesterday I repeated what both Mr. Hayden  '  and I had said consistently inside our own Parliament and  elsewhere - the condemnation by the Australian Government of  Vietnam's invasion and continued occupation of Cambodia.

 I added that from our point of view there should be a phased  withdrawal leading to a total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops  from Cambodia. There there should then be an act of  ,  self-determination for and by the Cambodian people and the 

 creation of the conditions which would permit displaced  Cambodians to return to their country and for normal  relations to be resumed between Vietnam, China, the ASEAN  |  countries and the international community at large. We indicated in our discussions yesterday that we attached very  considerable importance to ending Vietnam's present political  and economic isolation and the growing reliance on the Soviet  Union which was, in our judgement, simply entrenching great  |  power rivalry in the region.

 We indicated yesterday to the Prime Minister and the Foreign  Minister that our Government intended offering disaster relief  assistance to Vietnam and you have seen the reference to that,  but that we had taken no decisions in practical terms to resume  development assistance to Vietnam. We have not taken any such  decision.

 Now, we also pointed out to the Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister that while Australian aid was continuing to be  directed to displaced Cambodians in the Thai/Cambodia border  area, we also indicated to your leaders that Australia 

 continued to consider that meeting the humanitarian aid needs  of internees inside Cambodia was also necessary.

 One of our main intentions in the discussions was to convey to â   the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister our very great  concern - Australia's very great concern - at the possibility â   of any return to power of a regime as brutal as the Khmer  j Rouge in Cambodia.

 I can say that both General Prem and I agreed that our  discussions had been useful in clarifying the misunderstandings  which had recently arisen. We agreed that both Australia and  Thailand had the same view about the Cambodian situation, 

 carried disturbing implications for peaceful relations amongst  all the countries of the SE Asian region. And on the main  issues of principle that I have repeated to you - that is the  condemnation of the invasion by Vietnamese forces; the  necessity for'withdrawal of those forces; the creation of 

 the conditions wherein there can be the free expression of  the will of the Cambodian people; the creation of the conditions  for the return of refugees and displaced persons; and the !   emergence of a free and independent, non-aligned Cambodia -â   on those basic issue of principle, there was a fundamental  agreement between Australia and Thailand and the Prime Minister  and I - while noting that there was room for differences of  emphasis and approach in the manner in which each country 

 sought to give effect to these agreed principles - we agreed  and accepted that each country was directing its efforts towards  the achievement of those objectives. And we agreed that we  would continue to work in the closest possible contact and 

 communications on those matters or mutual interest. So, may  I therefore sum up in respect of that overall coverage which I  had conveyed to the Australian media yesterday, may I sum up  by saying that both Bill Hayden and I could not have been more 

 satisfied than we were with the talks that took place yesterday.

 In addition to those matters in respect of Indo-China generally  we also discussed a number of bilateral matters and those  discussions will lead, we know, to a further strengthening of  the relations between our two countries.

 Yesterday afternoon Mr. Hayden signed - with your Foreign  Minister - a co-financing agreement which is between our two  countries and the handling of the World Bank finance project  within which we will be involved in a managerial capacity.

 There had been some suggestion of the difficulty about that. Those difficulties have been resolved and Mr. Hayden signed  that co-financing agreement yesterday and I also indicated  yesterday that Australia will be joining an association of tin  producing countries - a move which had been urged upon us by  your government. .

 Now, I have in going over those previous matters, indicated to  you our basic position in regard to Cambodia, but I would add  now these observations to what I said to our press yesterday  and what I ’ve outlined to you. I want to emphasise that  Australia recognises the concern of Thailand as a front line 

 state, its special concerns with the problems in the area to  which I've been referring and it's because Australia recognises  that particular security concern of Thailand that we, as an  Australian Government,  have increased our contribution under 

 the defence co-operation program. That has been lifted from an  amount of zero some four years ago to an amount of over  $4 million now. We will continue to give emphasis to that.

 It involves contributions not only here into Thailand, but  maintaining the availability of a wide range of training  positions for Thai Armed Forces personnel within our training  programs in Australia.

 Now, the second point I would make is that Australia has,   through Mr. Hayden and myself-, referred to our ability to  speak to all the main protagonists in this Indo-China problem.-  the ASEAN countries, China, the United States, and Vietnam  itself. But Mr. Hayden, who has had the main carriage of  this, and I have from the beginning made it clear that we  recognise appropriately the modesty of our aspirations in this  regard and we, of course, accept quite straightforwardly, and  it is appropriate to say it here, that the capacity of Thailand  in these matters is potentially greater than our own, but we,  because of the connections and positions we have, will continue 

 to do what we can. .

 Now, the final point that I would wish to make in rounding  off the outline of Australia's position is that we have  referred - and I did hear again this morning - to the dangers  associated with the isolation of Vietnam in its relations with 

 the Soviet Union. I want to make it quite clear that we  understand that this has been a choice of Vietnam itself. It made a conscious decision to be dependent upon the Soviets  in this way. We don't say or imply that it has been something  of the making of the ASEAN countries. What we are talking 

 about - and I believe what ASEAN is talking about - is trying  to provide some incentives for Vietnam to reduce that dependency.

 Ladies and Gentlemen, that was all I would wish to say at this  stage and I would finally make the observation, however, .  |  generally in regard to our visit. I know I speak for Bill  Hayden when I say this, that we want to thank General Prem 

 and Air Chief Marshall Siddhi for the cordiality of their  welcome, the frankness of the exchanges between us and the way  in which we have both been able to not merely indicate the  â¢  Australian position,  but I believe as a result of that, to 

 leave here now with the relations between our two countries  even stronger than they have been in the past.

 JOURNALIST:  Prime Minister, what sort of incentives do you :  have in mind?

 P M :  Well, the position that all of the ASEAN countries and ourselves have been directing our attention to is one in which  the forces of Vietnam and the Vietnamese Government could be  satisfied that once they have phased withdrawal leading "to a 

 total withdrawal, that they would be satisfied that the  vacuum that was left was not going to be filled by the forces  of the Khmer Rouge as a dominant influence and we believe that  that is what we can work for - that there are signs on both  '  sides - if you look at the September statement of the ASEAN 

 I  countries and certain responses from Vietnam - that there is  some evidence of a loosening up of hitherto uncompromising  attitudes and if we can create that situation then we could  obviously- be looking to a position where there would be very 

 sound reasons for the countries of this area and others to start

 /4...

 to themselves to have more formal and constructive relations  with Vietnam. It can't be, in our judgement, be seen by  Vietnam itself, or any of the countries of this region, to  be in any of their interests to have this almost total 

 reliance by Vietnam on the Soviet Union. So, you've got  to move towards the situation where they can see the virtue  in ending that reliance in the way that I've suggested.
