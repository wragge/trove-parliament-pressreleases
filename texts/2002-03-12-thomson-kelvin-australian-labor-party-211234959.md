 KELVIN THOMSONMedia Release from the Shadow Minister for Environment & Heritage Drilling near the Great Barrier Reef Just say no, Dr. Kemp

 The Government’s statement that no drilling for oil or gas will take place on the Great Barrier Reef is not enough to adequately protect the reef.

 David Kemp’s press release on Saturday said that “no exploration will be allowed on the Reef if it significantly impacts on the World Heritage Area”.

 What does Dr. Kemp mean by significantly?  What level of impact on the World Heritage Area does he think is acceptable?

 It is not good enough for David Kemp claim that his hands are tied by the legislation and all he is doing is going through due process. There is nothing stopping Dr. Kemp from protecting the Reef by preventing exploration in the Townsville Trough- either through regulation with a zoning change under the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act, or by amending existing legislation.

 When a Norwegian tanker sought to bring in a load of asylum seekers into Australia last year, all hell broke loose.  The Howard Government called out the navy and introduced new legislation.  But when a Norwegian company wants to explore for oil just 50 kilometres from one of Australia’s greatest national treasures, the Government does nothing to stop it, and cites ‘due process’.
