 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER MR DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 DATE:   13 November 2006   

 TITLE:  Doorstop, Adelaide Airport   

 MR DOWNER:    I’m heading off to Lombok to sign the Framework Agreement on  Security Cooperation between Australia and Indonesia today. I’ll be doing that this afternoon.  This is an historic agreement, it is a very important underlining of the relationship between 

 Australia and Indonesia and it will provide very strong foundations for this relationship in  years ahead. I think it’s clear that the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono and Hassan  Wirajuda - the Foreign Minister and I have very good personal relationships, but this has got  to be a relationship that lasts long beyond personal relationships - this has got to be a  relationship which helps to ensure that in the future Australia and Indonesia are able to  cooperate in meeting the sorts of security challenges we may have in this part of the world.  Our two countries need to work together if we’re going to address those challenges. This  Framework Agreement - or security treaty, as it’s sometimes called - will be a real foundation  for that relationship. I think it’s a historical agreement for Australia and for Indonesia - it’s a  great step forward in our relationship and I think it will serve future generations of Australians  and Indonesians very well.   

 JOURNALIST:   To what extent has this pact been influenced by these recent issues with  Papuan refugees?   

 MR DOWNER:   It hasn’t really because the negotiations over this started around two  years ago and drafts had been exchanged well before that issue blew up. We, in terms of  Papua or other provinces of Indonesia, we just want to make a simple point and that is that we  support the territorial integrity of Indonesia and I think it is fundamentally in Australia’s  national interest that it supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia. I think it would damage  Australia’s security interests and it would damage our broader regional political interests if we  decided to get involved in secessionist movements in South East Asia. I think that’s the wrong  approach for Australia and we won’t be doing it. Nor did the previous Australian 

 Government, nor the Government before that - I don’t recall a time when Australia’s  Government have been supportive of secessionist movements within Papua New Guinea or  Indonesia or anywhere else.   

 JOURNALIST:   What pratical measures (inaudible)?   

 MR DOWNER:  Can I just try to help people - this is taking the Bob Brown narrative  and then turning that into some kind of a story. There is no narrative about Australia cracking  down on dissent within Australia or suggestions that somehow we’re going to intrude into 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 2

 people’s freedom of speech and expression. I think that this country, Australia, more than 100  years old, is mature enough to be able to dismiss those kinds of arguments with a flick of the  hand. Of course nobody is intruding on freedom of speech or freedom of expression in  Australia - people can believe and support what causes they like - but the Australian  Government has not and will not be doing anything to encourage secessionist movements in  Indonesia or for that matter anywhere else in South East Asia or the South Pacific.   

 JOURNALIST:  What (inaudible) before the Papuan issue blew up in Australia?   

 MR DOWNER:   Before the Papuan issue blew up, or before the 43 asylum seekers issue  blew up - there, that is something that has been in draft for a long time.    

 JOURNALIST:   Do you see them as being met?   

 MR DOWNER:   Again, this is the Bob Brown narrative - this isn’t a treaty that in any  way, first of all, derogates from human rights and secondly, let me make this point, this kind  of far-left narrative is based on a proposition that Indonesia is some kind of authoritarian  dictatorship. By the way, Indonesia’s gone through a dramatic transition to democracy - it’s a  liberal democracy. The Indonesian Government I know is committed to upholding  international norms of human rights. The Government is not in favour of human rights abuses  in any province of Indonesia and that abuses take place here and there in Indonesia, including  of course there have been abuses that have taken place in Papua, is not something that has  been endorsed by the Government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.   

 JOURNALIST:   (Inaudible) Indonesian Ambassador (inaudible)?   

 MR DOWNER:  This is not about that issue. It’s about security cooperation between  Australia and Indonesia, that’s a different - that’s not a central issue in the security  cooperation between Australia and Indonesia. That is not a central issue.   

 JOURNALIST:  What about the issue of (inaudible)?   

 MR DOWNER:    I think in the end if you want to develop counter-terrorism capabilities -  including assisting Australians who may be held hostage by terrorists in some part of  Indonesia - you need to have some sort of a relationship with people like that and Australia  historically has had a relationship with Kompassus and other elements of the Indonesian  army. I don’t think the Indonesian Government is encouraging the Indonesian army to  perpetrate human rights abuses - I think the government is very committed to upholding  international norms of human rights. At the end of the day, we need to take steps which  strengthen Australian security and our defence relationship with Indonesia is not a  relationship of sentiment or politics, it’s a relationship based on our own security interests.   

 JOURNALIST:   Will it allow (inaudible) information sharing with regards to (inaudible)  Bali 9?   

 MR DOWNER:   It’s a security agreement - it involves sharing information in relation to  security threats. In a case where people are trafficking in drugs, we obviously want to

 continue to develop cooperation between Australia and Indonesia because we have a very  strong policy on drugs - we have a zero tolerance approach to drugs like heroin, and the  Indonesian Government does, so we want to try to stop that. We’ll always work on the basis  of at least cooperation between our police forces and between our intelligence agencies in our  interests.   

 JOURNALIST:   On a different topic, you put forward some months ago a proposal for a  nuclear powered (inaudible) plant for Adelaide. Malcolm Turnbull’s in town today meeting  with the Government over water. Given that the situation is more dire now than when you 

 made that call, have you put that idea forward to him?   

 MR DOWNER:   I’ve certainly talked about it with my colleagues and what we’re doing  is we’re awaiting the report of Ziggy Switkowski’s committee and when that report comes out  we’ll be in a better position to make judgements about what’s viable and what isn’t viable in  terms of nuclear power. So at this stage, we are waiting for that report. I’ve had a briefing  from the committee but I haven’t seen the final report at all. Let’s wait until we get that  because one of the issues here is going to be the economics of these sorts of proposals. But  what I was talking about was a thousand megawatt nuclear power station which would  provide power for South Australia but also would drive a desalination plant which could  provide as much water for Adelaide as Adelaide currently sucks out of the River Murray. I’m  terribly worried about the dependence of Adelaide on water from the River Murray - 

 Adelaide is far too dependant on the River Murray. Whether a proposal like that is going to be  viable is going to - well, we’ll know more about that when Mr Switkowski reports.   

 JOURNALIT:  Minister, you’re going to Vietnam after Lombok, are you (inaudible)  North Korea?   

 MR DOWNER:  Let me just say about the APEC meeting - I’m going to the APEC  meeting in Vietnam, I’m going to be there with Foreign and Trade Ministers from around the  Asia Pacific region. There will be a series of issues that we’ll be focusing on - we’ll  obviously be focusing on the trade and investment and economic liberalisation agenda which 

 is so important for the prosperity of the region. We will also be talking about energy - clean  energy, energy which is environmentally responsible as well as secure supplies of energy.  APEC brings together many of the major players in international energy produces as well as 

 consumers - a country like Australia (inaudible). So the issue of - as we term it in Australia -  climate change, clean energy is going to be an important issue at this APEC meeting and I’ll  be pushing that at the Foreign and Trade Ministers’ meetings during the week. I’ll be meeting  with Condoleezza Rice and also with the Chinese and Japanese Foreign Ministers and we’ll  have an opportunity in those meetings to talk about the North Korean issue and we’d expect  the Six Party talks to take place before the end of this year and we hope that in those Six Party  Talks there can be a bit of progress. It’s going to be important to talk to the Chinese about  that.
