 impressed with the manner:, which Thailand was coping with its 

 special security problems..

 increased reliance Vietnam placed on the Soviet Union. In 

 these circumstances he was glad of the opportunity to discuss 

 with members of the Thai Government the important initiatives 

 undertaken by Thailand and other members of ASEAN to form a 

 new coalition government in Cambodia. This would clearly require 

 the withdrawal' of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.

 Mr Sinclair said that his visit to Thailand 

 came very soon after his appointment to his present Ministry.

 He had come to Thailand to meet his counterpart and exchange 

 views,  to be briefed on the areas of defence concern,  and to 

 explore possible avenues for closer practical defence contact 

 and co-operation.

 A number of new initiatives had emerged which he 

 would be looking at with a view to further development of 

 practical defence co-operation between Thailand and Australia.

 Mr Sinclair said that over the last two years 

 the Australian-Thai program of defence co-operation had 

 expanded significantly. In money terms expenditure has grown 

 from 2.4 million baht in 1978-80 to around 35 million baht in 

 1981-82.

 Australia's: interest in regional security and co-operation,"

 Mr Sinclair said-.,

 would; train in Australia during 1982.-83 in a wide range of 

 activities, - from advanced specialist, training in areas such 

 as armaments,  artillery and signals to underwater medicine 

 courses. Specialist study visits by groups of Thai Servicemen 

 to Australia to identify and develop other areas of practical 

 support were a particular feature of the program with Thailand,  

 and would continue. .  .

 Australia would provide an assistance package worth 28.25 

 million baht over the next three years to support the 20 

 Australian-built Nomad aircraft which are being progressively 

 delivered to the Royal Thai Air Force. .

 maintenance of Thai military aircraft by Australian defence 

 related industries were identified for detailed examination 

 and consideration. .  _

 Mr Sinclair said that he and his party had 

 been impressed by the warmth of their welcome in Thailand and 

 he was particularly pleased that in the defence area, as with 

 all aspects of Australia's relations,  a friendly and fruitful 

 relationship was being developed.
