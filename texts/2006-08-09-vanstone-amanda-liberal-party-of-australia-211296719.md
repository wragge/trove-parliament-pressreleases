  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  176.06 Wednesday 9 August 2006 

  Designated Unauthorised Arrivals Bill introduced to Parliament 

  An amended Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 was  introduced to Parliament today for the offshore processing of all unauthorised boat arrivals. 

  “The changes, announced by the Prime Minister on 21 June this year, do not alter the  thrust of the Bill or the fundamental principles of the Government’s offshore processing  system,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said. 

  “At the same time, however, the Bill provides significant concessions to those with  concerns, in particular regarding children in detention, merits review, reporting on agreed  time limits and oversight by the Ombudsman. 

  ”The changes received strong majority support from members of the Government party  room at a meeting held on 21 June and follow detailed discussion between Government  members and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. They also reflect the  Government’s response to the Senate committee’s report on the Bill. 

  “The legislation sends a strong message to people who want to travel to Australia illegally. 

  “The amended bill strikes a balance between continuing Australia’s strong commitment to  border protection and consistency with current onshore processing arrangements and our  in t e rn a t i o n a I o bl ig at ions. ” 

  The changes include: 

  Detention of minors as a measure of last resort; 

  0 Reporting to Parliament on merits review and time limits, including additional  provisions to require reporting to Parliament each financial year on arrangements  for review of refugee status determinations including the qualifications of the  reviewer, the number of claims for refugee status not determined within 90 days  and the reasons for this and the number of reviews not completed within 90 days  of their commencement and the reasons for this; 

  Minister’s powers, providing a non-compellable, non-reviewable power for the  Minister to grant a visa to a person covered by the offshore processing regime  where the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so (identical to the  powers that currently exist in relation to onshore applicants); 

  0 Confirming the Minister’s power to direct officers of the Department to take all 

  reasonable steps to encourage declared countries to provide suitable  residential accommodation for offshore processed persons; 

  Confirming the Commonwealth Ombudsman powers and investigations to  investigate action which relates to a matter of administration, taken by a  Department or prescribed authority, regardless of where the action takes place (the  Minister can also refer matters relating to offshore processed persons to the  Ombudsman to investigate and report on). The Ombudsman will provide a  statement that paraphrases the content of the report to avoid any breach of privacy,  with the statement to be tabled in Parliament; 

  0 Independent review of the operation and effectiveness of the arrangements, 

  requiring the Minister to commission an independent review of the legislation 2  years after commencement which must be provided to the Minister within 6 months  of the review commencing, and be tabled in Parliament. 

  Sunset provisions, operating five years after the Bill receives Royal Assent which  will not repeal the Bill as a whole, but will ensure arrangements revert to the status  quo so people who arrive at an excised offshore place after the activation of the  sunset provisions will stili be processed offshore.
