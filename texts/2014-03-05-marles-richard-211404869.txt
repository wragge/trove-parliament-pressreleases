 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Further inquiry into Manus Island events a must   

 Labor will support a motion to have the events that occurred at the Manus Island  Regional Processing Facility between 16 and 18 February 2014, referred to the Legal  and Constitutional Affairs References Committee for an inquiry.    

 Immigration and Border Protection Minister Scott Morrison has demonstrated a  staggering lack of oversight of the Manus Island Regional Processing facility.    

 It is vital we get to the bottom of what went wrong on the Minister’s watch. So far  Mr Morrison has consistently failed to provide an appropriate response to critical  questions relating to events on 16-18 February 2014.    

 The Manus Island facility is the cornerstone of Australia’s border protection policy  and it is vital it operates appropriately and provides asylum seekers with a safe and  protective environment.    

 This inquiry is due to commence on 1 April 2014 - allowing the Government to  deliver its own interim report into the incidents, due on March 31.
