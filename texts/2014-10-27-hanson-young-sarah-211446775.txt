 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 27 October 2014   

 Tony Abbott must overturn Morrison’s West  African refugee snub   

 The Immigration Minister’s announcement that no refugees will be accepted from West Africa  due to the ongoing Ebola crisis must be overturned by the Prime Minister, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 “While the government drags its feet in responding to the Ebola crisis, Scott Morrison has  slammed the door on West African refugees,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young asked.   

 “The Immigration Minister’s crusade against those in need has spread to West Africa and is  simply unacceptable.   

 “This miserly, selfish and cruel announcement from the government is not a reflection of our  nation’s character.   

 “Banning refugees from fleeing West Africa is like shuttering up the windows while a house  burns down.   

 “I call on Tony Abbott to pull his out-of-control Minister into line and reverse this shameful  decision.”
