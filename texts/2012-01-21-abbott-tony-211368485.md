 QUESTION: 

 With Ms Gillard deciding to embark on a trial, is that another broken promise? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Of course it is. She has dudded Andrew Wilkie and all the people who believed in mandatory pre-commitment, in the same way she dudded the Australian voters over the carbon tax before the election. This  demonstrates that the Prime Minister got the keys to the Lodge under false pretences. It shows that she is not  so much a good negotiator as a great deceiver and it shows that there is absolutely nothing that this Prime  Minister says that can be taken seriously. 

 QUESTION: 

 How would you describe this act? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 I think this is a betrayal. It’s the second great betrayal of the Gillard Government after the carbon tax. 

 QUESTION: 

 So how high is the trust factor then now? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 This, the message that every Australian needs to take from this is that nothing this Prime Minister says can  be trusted. Nothing this Prime Minister says can be believed. Nothing this Prime Minister says can be taken  seriously ever again. All of the promises she makes at the next election will have to be discounted, in the  same way all her previous commitments have been dishonoured. 

 QUESTION:

 Now I understand that you suggested that naval boats should be patrolling our waters to enforce the boat  people police. 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 We’ve been entirely consistent. There are three key elements to our policy to stop the boats: Nauru,  Temporary Protection Visas and turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. No-one should underestimate  our determination to stop the boats to protect Australia’s borders. 

 QUESTION: 

 But using sailors and using the Navy to do that - isn’t that putting sailors lives at risk unnecessarily? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 The best way to protect life at sea is to stop the boats. The sooner we can stop the boats, the sooner people  won’t be drowning at sea. 

 QUESTION: 

 So you are confident then that Australian Naval personnel won’t be put at any unnecessary risk? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 I am confident that Naval personnel have the professionalism to do the job. 

 QUESTION: 

 How - I mean you seen what Ashmore Reef looks like… I mean it’s pretty hairy. They might have the  professionalism, but do they have everything else they need to do that job adequately? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 It’s up to the nation to give them the resources they need to do the job and their professionalism will do the  rest.
