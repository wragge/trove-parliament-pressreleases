 Media Statement   

 Dreyfus Must Reveal Legal Advice on PNG Deal   

 The Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus must reveal to the public whether the Government received  advice from the Solicitor-General on the validity of the Rudd Government's deal with Papua New  Guinea on the transfer and resettlement of asylum seekers, before Mr Rudd signed the deal last  Friday. If so, the Attorney-General must release that advice to the public.    

 It  has  now  been revealed that  the  deal  between Australia  and the  Government of  Papua  New  Guinea is nothing but  a flimsy two  page 'Arrangement'.  It  is even more insubstantial than the  deal with Malaysia two years ago, also described not as an agreement but as an 'Arrangement',  which was struck down by the High Court.    

 The  Attorney-General  should  also  reveal  whether  the  Government  received  any  advice  as  to   whether the Arrangement is valid and enforceable according to the laws of Papua New Guinea,  and if so he must release that advice as well.
