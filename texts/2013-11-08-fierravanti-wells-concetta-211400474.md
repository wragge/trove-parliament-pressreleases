 Since 1788, Australia has been an immigrant society.  Successive waves of newcomers 

 eager for a better life have enriched our culture and added a heroic dimension to our 

 national story.

 I send my warmest wishes to everyone attending this year’s conference and am sure it 

 will be a successful event.

 The Hon Tony Abbott MP, Prime Minister of Australia 

 I would like to take this opportunity to add my own reflections to those of the Prime Minister. 

 I am delighted to join so many of you here on the Gold Coast at the 2013 FECCA National 

 Conference. I congratulate FECCA, in partnership with the Ethnic Communities Council of 

 Queensland and the Multicultural Communities Council of the Gold Coast, for organising what  is widely regarded as Australia’s leading multicultural conference. 

 Since 1979, FECCA has established itself as the national peak body representing culturally and 

 linguistically diverse Australians. Through its members, FECCA has strong links to Australia’s 

 diverse communities at the grass roots level and can be relied on for evidence­based advocacy 

 and advice.  This event is just one of the many activities FECCA undertakes each year to get  people thinking and talking about multicultural Australia.

 I would like to take a moment to particularly acknowledge Mr Pino Migliorino and the role he 

 has played over the last four years as Chair of FECCA.  Pino has been a passionate and tireless 

 advocate of multicultural Australia for many years, and certainly over the 30 years that I have  known him.  His skilful and energetic leadership of FECCA has been of tremendous value to all 

 Australians.  I thank him for his significant contribution to the nation and look forward to his 

 continuing support of our diverse society.

 We are here today because we all share an ongoing commitment to a culturally diverse  society which is unified by an overriding commitment to Australia.  This commitment is 

 reflected in my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services, having 

 special responsibility for multicultural affairs and settlement services. I look forward to 

 working closely with the Minister, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP to improve the well­being of 

 people and families right across Australia.

 I am excited by the opportunity to focus on the government’s commitment to building a 

 prosperous, cohesive nation, and to emphasise that multicultural Australia is about all 

 Australians.  As the daughter of migrants myself, I understand very well the hard work and 

 sacrifices that millions of our migrants have made to build a better life for themselves and  their children.

 Today is a good opportunity to share with you my own background within our multicultural 

 sphere of engagement.  Before being elected to Parliament, I was fortunate to serve the 

 Australian­Italian community as both a national and international representative through the  General Council of Italians Abroad and on Com.It.Es. both in the ACT and in NSW.  For 25 years 

 prior to entering the Senate, I had also been actively involved in a wide range of community

 activities.  I was also appointed as ministerial adviser to the Global Diversity Conference in 

 1995 and served with Pino and others as a member of the SOCOG Multicultural Advisory 

 Committee.  In the four years before becoming a Senator, I served on the Board of Father 

 Chris Riley’s Youth off the Streets, including two years as its Chairman.  My experience over  many years has given me a great insight into the expertise and capacity of non­government 

 organisations. 

 Through these roles I have seen first­hand that community organisations and the wider 

 settlement and multicultural affairs sector are filled with dedicated, hard­working people who  want to help others and make a real difference.  I would like to thank you for the knowledge, 

 skills and time that you contribute to help create a better Australia.

 Can I also take this opportunity to thank FECCA for the work you have undertaken in various 

 areas.  I would particularly like to acknowledge the work FECCA undertook in relation to CALD  ageing issues, a subject dear to my heart. 

 The ageing of our population is the biggest social issue facing Australia.  Australia has a rapidly 

 ageing population that is living longer with more complex health conditions and changing 

 disease patterns resulting in increasing and changing aged care needs.  Additionally, we are 

 experiencing a shift in the size and composition of households.  The implication of an ageing  population, including an increasingly larger culturally diverse ageing population, creates 

 challenges.

 One in four of our older Australians needing care come from a culturally diverse background.  

 It is important to cater for language needs in aged care, both in aged care facilities and in­ home care, because those from non­English speaking backgrounds often revert to their native 

 language or dialect and lose much of their English language skills as they age.  In addition, 

 linguistic needs are often overlaid with the need for cultural and religious understanding.

 This week my own personal family experience has crystallised in my mind the challenges that  we often share.  My 84 year old mother looks after my almost 85 year old dad who has 

 dementia.  Her own deteriorating health resulted in dad needing to go into respite just this 

 week.  He, like his friends, will require the appropriate level care which is tailored to meet 

 their cultural needs.  Fortunately this was made possible with a respite bed becoming 

 available in Wollongong in an aged care facility where there are many Italians.  But this will  not always be the case.  We will need to be cognisant that services will have to be delivered 

 across a broad spectrum to address the needs of a culturally diverse society.  I particularly 

 wish to commend FECCA for its innovative thinking in this regard.

 For generations, people have come to Australia for a better life.  Since 1945, more than 7  million people have permanently migrated to our country, including my parents who came to 

 Australia from Italy in the 1950s. They were part of a post­war immigration boom in Australia 

 that was driven in large part by people from Europe whose lives were left devastated by years 

 of conflict.  For many migrants who arrived in Australia at this time, it was a period of 

 separation and hardship trying to fit into a new and different culture.

 It is difficult for those of us who have not experienced migration personally to understand the 

 feeling of leaving behind all you know and love in search of new opportunities.  Yet despite 

 the challenges, migrants who came to these shores after World War Two made immediate 

 and lasting contributions to the well­being of our nation.  And they did so mainly without the  benefit of the modern support structures we now offer to our newest arrivals.

 These structures, such as settlement services — which aim to help refugees and migrants 

 become self­reliant and fully participate in all aspects of Australian life as quickly as possible 

 — are the result of decades of work and constant improvement in the ways in which we  welcome migrants into Australian society.

 With each wave of migration, new and exciting layers have been added to the fabric of our 

 nation.  Our culture is a unique mix that reflects both the rich mosaic of migrant communities 

 that have made Australia their home, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples  who represent the oldest continuous cultures in the world.

 Socially, culturally and economically we have grown through the efforts of all Australians 

 working together for the advancement of our nation. Australia is now one of the most diverse 

 and socially cohesive nations on earth.  Today, Australians identify with around 300 ancestries 

 and speak as many languages, including Indigenous languages.  More than a quarter of the  Australian population was born overseas.  Of those of us born in Australia, one in five has at 

 least one parent born overseas and nearly 4 million people speak a language other than 

 English at home.

 I myself was brought up in a bicultural, bilingual environment.  Indeed, I have lived my whole  life across the diversity that is today mainstream Australia.

 What is remarkable is that from this diversity, our nation has achieved great strength and 

 unity that continues to drive our prosperity.  Australians are united by an overriding loyalty to 

 Australia and our values.  As Australians we respect the Australian Constitution, parliamentary  democracy and the rule of law.  We support the freedom and dignity of the individual, 

 equality of men and women and freedom of speech and religion.  We embrace mutual 

 respect, tolerance, fair play and compassion for those in need.  We understand that English is 

 the national language and that it is an important unifying element of Australian society.

 The Scanlon Foundation’s Mapping Social Cohesion 2013 Report, indicates that Australians 

 have embraced our diversity—they respect our diversity.  It indicates strong levels of support 

 for Australia’s approach to multiculturalism, with respondents agreeing that multiculturalism 

 benefits economic development and encourages immigrants to become part of Australian 

 society.  It indicates Australians continue to have a strong sense of belonging to their country,  and take great pride in our way of life. 

 However, the research also shows that the level of social cohesion in Australia has fallen from 

 what it was in 2012.   The research also records the highest level of reported discrimination 

 when compared to findings of previous years, especially amongst Australians of non­English  speaking backgrounds.  These are issues warranting government and community attention, 

 and I would like to acknowledge the Scanlon Foundation and its partners, the Australian

 Multicultural Foundation and Monash University, for their important work to enhance social 

 cohesion within Australia and identify barriers to its success.

 During his vote of thanks at the 2012 inaugural Australian Multicultural Council Lecture in  recognising the achievements of Mr Frank Lowy AC,  Tony Abbott made the following 

 worthwhile observations.

 He noted that:

 “there’s no doubt that our country has been amongst the world’s most successful  immigrant societies and this reflects the welcome that the Australian people have 

 traditionally extended to newcomers including those from a vast variety of 

 backgrounds.  As well, it reflects the efforts that migrants have made to contribute to 

 their new home. 

 Further Mr Abbott stated that:

 “the policy of multiculturalism, which all sides of politics support, expresses our 

 willingness as a nation to let migrants assimilate in their own way and at their own 

 pace, because of our confidence in the gravitational pull of the Australian way of life.

 And most importantly, he reiterated that:

 “Newcomers to this country are not expected to surrender their heritage, but they are 

 expected to surrender their hatreds.”

 To this end we have succeeded like few other nations.  We have embraced change and turned 

 it into economic prosperity.  We have research and history which shows that migrants are 

 highly committed, hardworking and dedicated to making the greatest possible contribution.  

 Our common threads, such as our dedication to our nation and the desire to build a 

 prosperous future for all, will help us overcome any barriers we identify. 

 And identifying and addressing barriers to full participation is critical here.  The more barriers 

 we can overcome, the more we can connect people to Australia’s economic and social life, the 

 more cohesive and productive we will be.

 And I can assure you that the government is committed to addressing issues which impede  social cohesion.  For some of our newest migrants, these might include a lack of formal 

 education, poor knowledge of the English language, a lack of professional qualifications or a 

 culture and environment which is drastically different to what they are familiar with. 

 Through decades of successful service delivery and groundwork of evidence­based policy, we  have taken great strides to help migrants fully participate in our community.  This includes 

 promoting English language skills to position new migrants to contribute to the labour force 

 and strengthen our social cohesion. 

 However, there is still work to be done to improve, to refine and to further expand upon our  successes to date.  We will continue to investigate and explore new strategies which foster a

 8/07/2014 http://concettafierravantiwells.dss.gov.au/speeches/15

 prosperous and socially harmonious society where there is a sense of belonging for 

 Australians of all backgrounds.  We want to continue to draw out the best from our 

 multicultural society and work towards a better Australia.  Although our economy will evolve, 

 people will remain our greatest asset.  We need to capitalise on the social and economic  dividends that come from our rich cultural and linguistic diversity.  Our diversity will provide 

 us with the social capital which will allow us to reach out to the world, maximise the economic 

 opportunities which are available to us, and at the same time create a wealth of new 

 opportunities.  Our diversity brings knowledge of markets, trading practises and customs, and 

 provides innovation and insights which might not otherwise be available to us. 

 When this is coupled with a commitment to Australia’s prosperity, we can only succeed.  We 

 know that managing diversity and promoting community harmony takes work, and we are 

 prepared to work hard to achieve this.  With a focus on outcomes such as full participation in 

 Australian society, including meaningful employment which benefits both migrants and the  wider Australian community, I am sure we can continue to deliver what is best for the future 

 of our nation. 

 In our knowledge­based economy, we see the key to this as being education and 

 employment.  These are valuable goals and at the same time, they are outcomes which make  concrete and worthwhile contributions to Australia’s future.  Providing opportunities for new 

 Australians to participate in our learning institutions and our workplaces is a means to 

 promote participation, common values and cohesive communities.

 This is where all representative organisations, such as FECCA, can help.  You have your finger 

 on the pulse of multicultural Australia.  You have the knowledge and experience.  We will be  relying on your input and advice to help us identify and address barriers to our future success 

 as a nation.

 As I said earlier, we know that diversity works for all Australians. We have seen it as an 

 ongoing process for generations.  Australia’s cultural diversity is a source of great social and  economic strength and the contributions of migrants and their families spanning generations 

 has helped forge the unique Australian way of life that we enjoy today.  My own experience 

 growing up is a testament to our success. It shows that migrants and their children can, and 

 will, make positive and meaningful contributions to our nation, in many different ways.

 From here, I expect that we will roll up our collective sleeves, look squarely at the challenges 

 in front of us and act in the best interests of our nation’s future prosperity.  But we will need 

 to maintain our eternal vigilance to ensure that any act of intolerance or racism is repudiated 

 and countered at every opportunity. The recent and deplorable anti­Semitic attacks in Sydney 

 when four men and a woman were attacked while walking home from a synagogue  demonstrate that collectively we must always aspire to discourage such unlawful behaviour.  

 As we should also, for example, repudiate any subtle acts in the workplace or on the sporting 

 field which diminishes the self­worth of the individual.  With dedication, effort and 

 commitment, we can build on over 65 years of planned migration.  This conference is one part 

 of that work, and I hope you will find it engaging and meaningful.
