 Media release 

 

 Palmer United Takes Federal Focus to Achieve Even More for Australians  The Palmer United Party announced today it would no longer contest state elections in  order to concentrate on achieving more for Australians at the federal level.   

 National director Peter Burke has confirmed that the Palmer United Party would contest  all seats at the next federal election and move its focus away from state elections.   

 “The party executive has decided, in consultation with our many thousands of members,  that the federal platform is where we can achieve more for Australians moving forward,’’  Mr Burke said.   

 The party’s federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said the Palmer United  Party had received great levels of response and interest for House of Representative  positions at the next federal election.   

 “We are confident of fielding very strong candidates from a wide section of the  community and all walks of life to continue achieving excellent outcomes for all  Australians at federal level,’’ Mr Palmer said.   

 “We believe Federal parliament is where the Palmer United Party can make the most  valuable contribution so that is where we will be focussing our attention in the future.   

 “Our significant achievements to date and ongoing activities show that the Palmer United  Party can make a major positive difference to the lives of Australians and that a vote for  any Palmer United Party federal candidate  is a valuable investment in Australia’s future,  not a wasted vote,’’ Mr Palmer said.   

 Since entering federal politics, the Palmer United Party and Clive Palmer have:  ·         Ensured that a long promised $4.9 billion commitment to upgrade the Bruce Highway  has become a reality;  ·         Ensured that the Palmer United Party policy of lobbyists not holding executive 

 positions within political parties was adopted by the Abbott government at their first  cabinet meeting;  ·         Ensured that the federal Treasurer, Joe Hockey, rejected an American company’s  takeover bid for the Australian company GrainCorp, by: speaking out on the issue,
