  MEASURES TO DISCOURAGE ABUSE OF REFUGEE APPLICATIONS 

  The Coalition will proceed with measures designed to address abuse in the refugee  application process, despite moves by the Greens in the Senate the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today. 

  "The Opposition has accepted and recognised the Government's concern and has  agreed to work constructively to address the problem. I have agreed to some  adjustments which do not affect the integrity of the measures," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "As a result, the Opposition has undertaken to support the Government in rejecting the  Greens' proposed disallowance of regUlations." 

  The measures which take effect on 1 July, include limitations on access to work rights  for people making protection visa applications , and a post-decisi~m fee of $1,000 for  unsuccessful Refugee Review Tribunal applications . 

  "There are clear indications that significant numbers of people are lodging protection  visa applications in the full knowledge that they have no claim for refugee status. Their  intention is to delay their departure and obtain work rights," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "As a result of the discussions, the post-decision fee will have a two year sunset clause  and will be examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, but will come into  effect as planned." 

  "Unless a protection visa application is made within 45 days of arrival in Australia, no  work rights will accrue. At present there is no time limit." 

  "This will be a disincentive for people who are trying to extend their stay in Australia or  who have overstayed their visa and are simply abusing the system by making non bona  fide applications ." 

  "I have agreed that where there are significant changed circumstances, my Department  will give processing priority or in very limited circumstances, access to work rights." 

  Other measures in the discussions with the Opposition related to appeal periods for  merits review of refugee and migration cases and refund of review application fees in  migration cases, where the applicant is successful. 

  "To remain Budget neutral, this will necessitate an increase in application fees for the  Immigration Review Tribunal to $850," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "The government is determined to address fraud and abuse of the refugee and  migration application process and will restore public confidence in the system ."
