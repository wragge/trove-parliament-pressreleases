  SAS storming of Tampa deplorable

  Unions call on IMO to break 
deadlock 

  

 THE Maritime Union deplores what is essentially a 
military invasion of a friendly ship in peace time. National Secretary 
Paddy Crumlin described the actions of the Howard Government as inappropriate, 
inhumane and deserving of international condemnation.

  

 “People smuggling has to be combated,” he said. 
“But the perpetrators are the ones who need to be targeted, not the 
innocent victims, the master and crew of a vessel answering a distress 
call from a sinking ship. Nor pregnant women and children. This is nothing 
less than a cynical reelection gambit - Mr Howard’s Falklands War.”

  

 The Maritime Union has sent messages of support to 
Wilhemsen Line, the Master of the Tampa, the Norwegian Embassy and the 
international trade union movement. It’s WA branch officials are also 
meeting with representatives of the WA labour council and Christmas 
Island unions later today.

  

 Meanwhile the International Transport Workers’ Federation 
yesterday issued a statement in London calling on the Australian Government 
to allow the Tampa to proceed to Christmas Island due to the unacceptable 
risk to crew and asylum seekers. The ITF has also called on International 
Maritime Organisation Secretary General William O’Neill to urgently 
resolve the situation and put in place binding international rules for 
such crisis.

  

 The MUA and the Tampa crew unions are all ITF affiliates.
