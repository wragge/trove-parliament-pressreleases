 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW 

 

 Austal Shipyard, Henderson WA   

 11.30 am, Wednesday 17 December 2003   

 E&oe_______________________________________Patrol Boat, Labor’s Coastguard 

 

 Journalist 

 Senator what role will these patrol boats have in coastal security? 

 Senator Hill 

 Well  they  will  be  covering  our  territorial  waters.   They  will  be  dealing  with  illegal   people movement, our fishing beaches, transnational crime.  They are an important  part of protecting our sovereignty.   

 Journalist 

 How will they enhance it though? 

 Senator Hill 

 Longer range, more capable, faster, heavier weapons.  Really a very capable vessel. 

 Journalist 

 Will they be working in addition to the current fleet?  

 Senator Hill 

 They will follow on from the current fleet.  The first will be produced in 17 months  time.  They’ve then got a 15 year contract for these boats with DMS.  They will be  based  in  Darwin  and  in  Cairns  and  as  I’ve  said  they  will  basically  cover  our   territorial seas and protect our sovereignty.   

 Journalist 

 So this replaces what we’ve got or is it in addition to what we’ve got. 

 Senator Hill 

 No this is the new generation.  This is an enhanced capability.  It actually - we get  more hours at sea with these boats.  They can stay at sea longer.  As I’ve said they  are faster, they’ve got a 3,000 nautical mile range.  They can handle much heavier  sea  states.   We’re  very  confident  and  the  Navy  is  very  confident  that  this  is  the   vessel that they need to protect Australia’s territorial waters for the next 15 years. 

 Journalist 

 What about the North West Coast and the issue of refugees and also the issue of   the North West Shelf?  What about security there?

 Senator Hill 

 They  cover  that.   They  cover  it  in  conjunction  with  our   maritime  surveillance   aircraft and also with the customs service.  So we’ve really got a number of different  layers.  We - our surveillance is from the air.  In more distance waters it’s through  these Navy Patrol boats.  Closer in waters it’s through the customs boats which are  also produced by Austal here in Western Australia. 

 Journalist 

 But how can they cover it from Darwin and Cairns? 

 Senator Hill 

 I  said  they’ve  got  a  3,000  mile  radius  and  they  obviously  refuel  and  replenish  in   other  ports  as  well.   I  simply  said  that  the  bases  are  in  Darwin  and  Cairns.   It’s   economic  reasons,  you  don’t  want  too  many  bases.   You’ve  got  to  maintain   obviously maintenance support staff and the like. 

 Journalist 

 So is this in lieu of a Coastguard that the opposition is talking about? 

 Senator Hill 

 Well  their  so  called  Coastguard,  if  they’re  recycling  Simon  Creans’  Coastguard   which  I  understand  they  are  doing,  is  really  taking  what  we  already  have  in   customs, adding what we’ve got here with the Navy and renaming it.  So it doesn’t  actually  give  you  any  more  capability  at  all.   You  know  we’ve  found  through  a   combination of Air Force with our P3 Orions, these boats that are operated by the 

 Navy and the Customs boats that are obviously operated by Customs, that we can  more than adequately protect our waters.   

 Journalist 

 It is just a reluctance for you to call it a Coastguard because it was the Oppositions  idea? 

 Senator Hill 

 Well they call it a Coastguard but what I’m saying to you is that it is really nothing  more  than  what  we  have  already.   They  rename  it.   It  seems  that  it’s  a  recycle  of   their  previous  policy  and  then  they  try  to  kid  the  Australian  people  that  they  are   more secure.  We already have the capabilities in place.  We have a good working  relationship, well established relationship between Customs, Airforce and Navy and  it’s demonstrated that it does the job well.  So today, here we are, we’ve signed a  contract, $550 million for a new generation of patrol boats.  The Prime Minister on  the  other  side  of  Australia  has  announced  enhanced  surveillance  of  the  Southern   Ocean  as  well  through  another  capability.   We’ve  already  got  it  in  place  and  it’s   doing the job well. 

 Journalist 

 How many of these patrol boats do you anticipate on the waters at one time? 

 Senator Hill 

 The obligation is to provide us with the hours that we need.  So they’ve worked out  that they need 12 patrol boats to be able to do that job.  12 patrol boats of this type  with this range, with this capability.
