 $80,000 TO ASSIST REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS TO SETTLE IN WESTERN VICTORIA   

 A Community Connections programme to help refugees and migrants integrate into the broader Western Victorian  community has received a boost through the Federal Government’s 2007-08 Settlement Grants Programme,  Federal Member for Wannon, David Hawker said today.   

 The Settlement Grants Programme grants are aimed at refugees, family sponsored migrants and the dependents  of those on skilled migration visas with poor levels of English.   

 Mr Hawker said Community Connections will receive $80,000 to assist in orientation to Australia, developing  communities, and integration services to eligible target group arrivals in the Wimmera and Western Victoria.       

 “The project will deliver services to humanitarian entrants, dependents of skilled migrants and small and emerging  communities,” he said.   

 “The services will include casework and referral, provision of information and promotion of Australian norms.  The  project will also assist community leaders to organize and promote their community positively and interact with the  broader community, strengthen links with mainstream services and assist communities to use their existing skills to  generate income. 

 

 “I congratulate Community Connections on their successful project which will help new arrivals quickly develop a  general understanding of the local community so they can integrate as soon as possible and make the most of the  opportunities available in our region.”   

 Mr Hawker said the Federal Government would spend $32 million in 2007-08, including $19 million on new projects,  on a range of services designed to help integrate refugees and other migrants into the broader community.   

 “The funding went to 149 organisations across the country, providing 231 projects to help refugees and other  migrants build self-reliance, connect with mainstream services and generally take part economically and socially in  the Australian community,” Mr Hawker said.   

 Settlement Grants Programme projects help migrants and refugees build practical skills necessary to interact with  the Australian community, such as obtaining a driver’s licence and learning road rules, access medical services,  and helping their children succeed at school.
