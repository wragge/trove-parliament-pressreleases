 YET ANOTHER CALL FOR POLICY CHANGE ON  TPV HOLDERS   

 

 Labor welcomes yet another call for the Howard Government to support a policy change  for refugees in Australia on Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs).   

 Professor Harry Minas, a member of the Federal Government’s Immigration Detention  Advisory Group, has joined a growing group of Coalition backbenchers in calling on the  Howard Government to resolve the uncertainty that many TPV holders face under the  current system.   

 There are currently 8,000 to 9,000 TPV holders in the Australian community.  Nearly  4,000 of them have lived in the Australian community for over 3 years.     

 Under John Howard’s TPV system, these people have no certainty in their lives and  could potentially live in the Australian community on a temporary basis for the rest of  their lives.    

 Professor Minas has highlighted the difficulty TPV holders face by living and working in  the Australian community without any certainty of where their future lies.   

 Labor’s policy change to a two year one-off TPV will end that uncertainty.   

 Labor shares Professor Minas' belief that these people deserve certainty, and along with  several Coalition backbenchers, urges John Howard to face up to the TPV problem he has  created.
