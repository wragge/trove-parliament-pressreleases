 Migrants choose Queensland to settle 

 Increasing numbers of migrants are choosing Queensland to set up home, with settler numbers  at their highest since the Coalition came to government. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said 24 862 people  migrated to Australia and settled in Queensland in 2005-2006, up almost 10 per cent on the  previous year. 

 ‘Australians have always known what a wonderful place Queensland is to live and visit but in  the past five years the state has also become an increasingly popular destination for migrants,’  Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘The Queensland community is to be congratulated for welcoming these people into their lives  so readily and willingly.’ 

 Among the new arrivals to Queensland were more than 5000 people from the United Kingdom,  590 from Sudan, 758 from the Philippines, 640 from China, 713 from India and 995 South  Africans. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’    

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
