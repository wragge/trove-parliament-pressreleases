 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVEW, AMAROO  PRIMARY SCHOOL,  CANBERRA   16 OCTOBER 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:    Solar Schools; Drought & climate change; Media Laws; TPVs;  SA ALP Conference; Siev X memorial.   

 BEAZLEY:  All praise to the good folk who planned and operate this  school.  This is the future of our country.  This is schools which are at least in  part solar powered, wind powered.  It is a fantastic thing that a school as been  constructed and operated along these principles.  This is the way we deal with  the global warming issues.     

 Our future is about renewables, not reactors.  The lines are very clear; John  Howard is now very firmly committed to a nuclear future for this nation.  Nuclear  reactors that will be the source of power generation here.  We say no - that’s not  the modern way.  To be about a decent Australian future you’re about  renewables.  You’re about the solar power; the wind power that you can see now  playing such a role, so effectively, ensuring the comfort and the convenience of  the kids and the teachers in this school.  That’s the way to go.  That’s where we  want to end up.  That is why we’ll deal with our task in making sure Australia  makes a contribution to reducing Greenhouse gas emissions.  That is what will  ensure, not just the future of this nation, but the future of the globe.     

 It also impacts of course on our response to this, on what happens with water.   This school also has recycled water and the truth of the matter is this:  If you’re  not about dealing with climate change, with the heating up of our globe, you’re  not dealing long-term, with the water crisis in this country.  It’s as simple as that.   So, if we’re going to deal both with the issues of global warming and if we’re 

 going to deal with the water crisis, it’s the sorts of renewables that are  represented by the powering of this school and of course too, by it’s recycled  water performance - that’s the way to go.  I’ll just let Anthony say a word or two.   

 ALBANESE:  I’m very please to be here with Kim in support of Labor’s  Solar Schools Policy.  We’d make every school look like this, 10,000 solar  schools around the nation.  Why would we concentrate on schools as a first  step?  Because in recycling, what it showed was that if you concentrate on the  schools the young people go back to their families and pretty soon the message  gets out amongst the broader community.   

 

 Can I also say that tomorrow, the Environment Minister, Senator Campbell will  lead a delegation to China of Australian Renewable Energy Providers.  That is a  hypocritical act beyond belief.  This is a Government that is shutting down our  renewable energy industry.  We’ve had the Bald Hill winds farm, a $220 million  project in Victoria stopped.  We’ve seen the Vestas factory, producing wind  turbines in Northern Tasmania closed with the loss of 100 jobs.  And the very  company, Roaring Forties, which is based in Tasmania, which is opening a $300  million wind farm in China, announced after the Budget they would not proceed  with two wind projects in South Australia and Tasmania, worth some $550  million.  It is a tragedy that renewable energy is welcome in China but not  welcome here.   

 The Environment Minister, on Friday night, on Lateline made the comment that  these companies were taking advantage of the clean development mechanism  under the Kyoto Protocol.  The only way in which they can do that is to set up  business off-shore with offices in Fiji or New Zealand or some other country that  has ratified Kyoto.  So, here you have the case that even Australian companies  are not being allowed to stay in Australia if they want to take advantage of the  emerging trillion dollar industry that is in renewables.     

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the Government is expected to increase drought  support to around about $2 billion, is that enough in your mind?   

 BEAZLEY:  We will support anything that relieves the farmers.  This is a  terrible drought afflicting us and it’s rolling in on top of another drought and the  farmers must be feeling the pinch terribly now.  All our sympathies are with them.   This is a nation which rallies around the farmers in circumstances like this and  we are right to do so - that is the immediate - that’s what has to be done now.   And we will stand alongside the Government supporting all measures which are  effective in dealing with the problem.  But that’s the here and now.  The long-term, if you want to resolve these sorts of issues, or to lessen their impact, we  clearly have to take a stand on dealing with the issues of global warming.   Because you cannot resolve the water crisis long-term in this country without  resolving the global warming issue.   

 JOURNALIST: Turning around the whole renewable energy situation in  Australia is going to cost a lot of money.  How will you do that, will you simply  increase the renewable energy targets?   

 BEAZLEY:  I think the thing that’s interesting about this is it actually  saves money.  It actually saves money on the operation of this school for  example, of the use of solar powered systems and of wind power and it’s been  put in place here with the development of a new school and a lot of the State  Governments now are looking at ensuring that the new schools are  environmentally friendly schools with these capacities.  We think that the issues 

 can largely be resolved with what you might describe as market-based solutions,  putting in place emissions trading.  So, it’s not something that impacts extremely  heavily on the expenditures of government.  It does to a degree, but when you’ve  got the whole community rallied in behind it and taking the steps themselves, you  can go an awful long way without big budgetary impacts.   

 JOURNALIST: On media laws, John Murphy and perhaps one or two other  backbenchers want the laws wound back and are also talking about  compensating the big media owners.  Is that something you will consider? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  Firstly can I say that it’s appalling that these laws have  passed, or will pass as the Government’s got the numbers in the House of  Representatives.  It was a bad day when they when they went through the  Senate.  The previous Labor Government got the balance right on the question  on diversity in the media and there was no reason not to persist with the position  which we had reached to this point.     

 Now, we have this law coming in.  What we’re going to do is we’re going to take  a look at how it works, how its unintended consequences operate as well as its  intended ones.  And then we’ll put forward policy at the next election on media  diversity and it will be relevant to the circumstances that these laws have  created.  We will be pursuing media diversity as a political issue at the next  election.   

 JOURNALIST: How do you think it would go down in the electorate, the idea  of paying Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer and James Packer for these laws?   

 BEAZLEY:  Let’s just take a look at how these laws are bedded down  and the impact they have and what we next need to do to ensure that diversity  can, to some extent be restored.  Everything we do is in the framework of  sensible, budgetary policy and the fiscal restraint we need to ensure that the  Budget remains in balance.  Be in on media issues; be in on environmental  issues; skills - you care to name it - that’s where we come from.  We’re about  being economically responsible.  Having said that we’re about being  economically responsible, we’re also democrats.  We want democratic politics in  this county and democrat politics require diverse media.  So, we’ll take a look at  how the laws go and look at what we need to do.   

 JOURNALIST: There’s a suggestion in today’s media that Labor’s looking at  dumping temporary protection visas and giving refugees permanent status  immediately.  Is this something that you agree with? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  We need to deter people smugglers and we need also to  avoid disasters like that SIEV X, that sad, tragic situation - the anniversary of  which is today - and Tony Burke, our Immigration spokesman, has been taking a  look at the best ways of doing that and will make some recommendations to the 

 National Conference and some of those recommendations will go to the TPV  system.  The Government’s already made substantial changes in its effective  operation so we will be discussing that at the National Conference.   

 JOURNALIST: If you had your time all over again, would you have spoken  to the South Australian Labor Party Conference, given that they barred non-union  journalists?   

 BEAZLEY:  I’ll always speak to the South Australian Labor Party  Conference.  The South Australian position is unique.  There is no other Party  Conference, Federal or State, which operates with a ban on journalists.  What I  did, when confronted with that situation, was to go outside and do a doorstop, not  just rely on anything else that I’d said in the place, so that people had a chance  to have a go at me about it.  But this is an issue you’d have to take up with the  State Secretary in South Australia.   

 JOURNALIST: But it’s not a good look, though, is it?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well, it’s been a position in place for some considerable time  on their part, and the way I deal with it is to ensure that all journalists have a  chance to have a go at me when I’m there.   

 JOURNALIST: You, as the alternative Prime Minister, are going around  talking about IR, saying you’re going to rip them up because Labor is about  choice.  There was no choice at a Labor Party Conference at which you spoke. 

 

 BEAZLEY: Well, as far as I’m concerned, I dealt with that problem by coming  out and speaking to the journalists.  If I didn’t support choice, I probably wouldn’t  have.  But I do, so therefore I was out having a chat to you after that Conference  was over.  The issue itself has to be resolved by the South Australians.  They’ve  resolved it one way.  Every other Conference of the Party resolves it another.     

 JOURNALIST: Just one more on the SIEV X.  Do you think there needs to  be a permanent memorial, rather than a temporary one, here in Canberra?   

 BEAZLEY: I think the tragedy is massive.  The best thing we can do is to deter  people smugglers and to run an effective immigration policy so we don’t have  things like that happen again.  That’s the best memorial you could conceivably  offer to the people who sadly lost their life on that.
