 NSW Maintains its Popularity Among Settlers

 Australia’s most recent Olympic Games host, New South Wales, continues to be an appealing destination for new arrivals to the country.

 More than 44 000 people arrived and settled in New South Wales, with the largest number of people coming from the United Kingdom followed by  New Zealand, China and India.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, with New  South Wales attracting more than 3500 settlers compared to last year’s figure of 40 561.

 Senator Vanstone said New South Wales had always proven a popular destination for migrant and refugee settlers, with an increase of 15 per cent  on the 38 000 settlers in 1994-95.

 On the national front, more than 123 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2004-05, up 40 per cent on the 1994-95 figures.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
