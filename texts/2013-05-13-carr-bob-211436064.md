 Doorstop interview 

 Transcript, E&OE, proof only 

 13 May 2013 

 BOB CARR: I'm proud to report that the budget that will be brought  down tomorrow increases Australia's aid to a record $5.7 billion in  2013, 2014. That's an increase - let me underline it - an increase in  the aid budget of around $500 million or 9.6 per cent. This is a terrific  achievement by the Government given the contraction in revenues.  We can be very proud of that. Australia can be very proud of it. It's  the highest the aid budget's been as a percentage of GNI in over 25  years. And in dollar terms, of course, the largest aid budget in  history. 

 It's going to make a difference. It's going to enable us to target  malnutrition among women and children in the Asia-Pacific,  providing over one million additional people with better access to  food and improved nutrition; lift universal education by supporting  an additional 1.2 million children reaching school; increasing access  to maternal and child health services for a further 900,000 women;  and in Solomon Islands, increase the proportion of births attended  by skilled birth attendants to 90 per cent by 2015. 

 So these are real improvements, practical improvements in the lives  of the people we're committed to help, made possible by they fact  we are increasing the aid budget, not freezing it. We're not reducing  it. We're increasing it. Of course I would love to be able to increase it  according to a more ambitious trajectory. But the revenues have  contracted and the aid budget's going to be affected by this as much  as any other area of government. But because of the support of the  Treasurer, [affected] to a far less extent than I think anyone looking  at revenue trends could have imagined. 

 We can be very proud of the fact that the amount of the aid budget  being used to sustain asylum-seekers on Australian soil is being  capped. This is something the aid community asked us to do. It's  difficult given the sheer cost the budgetary impact of arrivals in  Australia, but nonetheless the Treasurer has agreed to cap it at the  figure it was at last year. 

 So I think, given the pressures on it, it's an extraordinarily good  outcome for Australia. Overseas aid's risen every year in this  government, an increase of over 60 per cent since 2007-2008. And I  think as we enter the election period there ought to be a bit of onus  placed on the Coalition to state clearly, unequivocally where they  stand. 

 QUESTION: Sir, can I ask you about that $375 million because just  going backwards to December that was the first time it ever  happened, that $375 million went from one budget to another. So  now you're confirming it's happening again in this next financial year.  Can you explain exactly how that money will be spent once it goes to  Immigration? What will it be spent on? 

 BOB CARR: Well, first of all, it's being capped. That's the important  point. And it's being spent on the sustenance of asylum seekers who 

 end up on Australian soil. For this reason: supporting them here is  exactly the same principle as supporting them in a refugee camp  somewhere else - with blankets and food and child protection,  emergency accommodation, medical services. The principle is the  same. And that's why the OECD guidelines, the guidelines that  govern our nations, can categorise their aid, what they can count as  aid and what they can't count. Those OECD guidelines contemplate  governments using a proportion of their aid budget for onshore  refugee sustenance. And that's why countries with very substantial  reputations like Norway, Sweden, the United States use proportions  of their aid budget to support onshore refugee sustenance. 

 When it comes to how we do in comparison with others - other  OECD nations - we're about the middle. We're about the middle  when it comes to the investment of ODA funds in onshore refugee  support. 

 QUESTION: And is PNG and Nauru still exempt from that cap? 

 BOB CARR: Yes. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, after you confirmed by September that  $375m was being diverted .. [indistinct] OECD's Development  Assistance Committee's recent review said that that decision was  altered in [indistinct] in the overall ODA budget, which led to a  decrease in 255 million for AusAID's programming. What's the  impact of this going to be on AusAID programming? Isn't it going to  have… 

 BOB CARR: It's too early to say but it is a reprioritisation. And we're  committed to supporting people brought here who claim asylum  seeker status. There wouldn't be an eyebrow raised if the money 

 were going to supporting them in a refugee camp somewhere in the  region. 

 QUESTION: What programs… 

 BOB CARR: It's too early to say. 

 QUESTION: Why is it that Britain can continue its march toward 0.7  per cent of GNI. 

 BOB CARR: Well, we'll see how Britain goes given the pressures on  the British budget, but across the OECD, across the 24 nations of the  OECD, the average cut has been four per cent. We're not cutting.  We're increasing. We're increasing by 9.6 per cent despite all the  pressures on the budget, despite all the contraction of revenues,  we're managing two things to increase the budget on aid by 9.6 per  cent - a pretty respectable figure - and second to cap the amount  within that aid budget that goes legitimately - altogether  legitimately - on the sustenance of asylum seekers on Australian soil 

 QUESTION: Under this cap, are you prepared to provide a  breakdown of what… 

 BOB CARR: We're prepared to provide exactly what we provided last  year. 

 QUESTION: Australia campaigned quite heavily during its bid for the  UN Security Council, that we do what we say we do internationally,  and we also are a leader in the region. What do you say to  international communities and particular in our own region who feel  cheated by this? 

 BOB CARR: They don't. I haven't had a single conversation in all my  travels, in all my engagement with foreign ministers, with presidents,  prime ministers. I haven't encountered anything except support, 

 encouragement and gratitude for Australia's big commitment on  overseas aid. 

 QUESTION: But surely this will mean that some, you know, programs  in our own region will be slashed? 

 BOB CARR: Again, our aid budget is going up. The aid budget is going  up. We're doing more in the region, not less in the region. The aid  budget's increasing and as a result there are more people being  helped to decent nutrition, to attendants at birth, lowering the rate  of maternal death, increasing the level of child support and  sustaining hundreds of thousands of more students throughout their  schooling. That's a very good outcome. Given the pressures on the  budget, given the contraction in revenues, this is an extraordinarily  good outcome. 

 QUESTION: Mr Carr, can we just talk for a minute about that graph  line of increasing the funding. It's now being pushed out two years  later… 

 BOB CARR: Yes. 

 QUESTION: …than the original plan to reach 0.5 percent of GNI. Can  you explain to us, and to everyone else who wanted to know in the  community, what is going to be the impact of that because AusAID  itself has been gearing up all of its resources towards this increase?  All aid agencies… what will happen? What amounts are we talking  about? 

 BOB CARR: Well, what that means is that we are going to be  increasing our aid but not at the rate we had hoped in economically  more buoyant times. As we did last year, we'll provide all those  details. It'll be publicly available. 

 QUESTION: How do recipients provide long-term outcomes if they  can't tell year to year how much money they're getting. How do you  create growth and change? 

 BOB CARR: Well, the alternative would be to borrow money to  spend on overseas development assistance. And that's simply not  sustainable. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, Costello says this decision will cost  lives…thousands of lives. 

 BOB CARR: Well, he could just as logically say that not doubling the  aid budget costs lives. I mean you can play that game endlessly. You  can say not borrowing $10 billion to spend on agencies development  costs lives. You can't spend money you haven't got. You can't spend  money you haven't got. You can't borrow money to sustain an aid  budget. 

 With a dramatic contraction in Australian revenues caused by a drop  in profits caused in turn by the high value of the Australia dollar, the  Government's got to face hard choices. But this is - given those  pressures, to actually deliver an increase in the aid budget of 9.6 per  cent and to say yes, we're going to cap the amount going altogether  legitimately on the sustaining of asylum seekers who arrive on  Australian soil is a very good outcome. 

 And behind the obligatory and altogether understandable criticism  made by members of the aid community who wanted us to get - I  endorse their aspiration altogether - to that 0.5 per cent faster.  There was an implicit or explicit understanding that capping that  amount was a good thing and in these difficult, difficult  circumstances actually increasing the aid budget was a very good  thing. 

 QUESTION: Will any countries be particularly affected by this  change? 

 BOB CARR: You can't say that. Our commitment… 

 QUESTION: [Indistinct] 

 BOB CARR: As I said, I think I've said this three times now, in the way  we did last year, we'll provide full details country by country. 

 QUESTION: When will that be? On budget night or not? Each country  by country. 

 BOB CARR: I think last year we provided it within a couple of weeks.  Yep. 

 QUESTION: How do you think the deferral looks overseas, though?  Particularly for the Prime Minister's who's… 

 BOB CARR: As the rest of the world sees it, Australia is a very  generous donor. Australia is in the front ranks of donor countries. No  one sees it any other way Don't forget across the OECD there's been  an average four per cent reduction in aid. And I look at Australia and  it's up 9.6 per cent. There's only - that only invites a generous  assessment. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, under this cap money that's money  [indistinct], are you clear on who has accountability for that spend?  There seems to be some confusion in the estimates process earlier  this year about who is responsible? Is that DIAC? Is that AusAID?  Who is responsible for that spend? 

 BOB CARR: Well, AusAID doesn't administer the onshore processing,  the sustenance of refugees. I don't know why there'd be confusion  about that. 

 QUESTION: So - sorry - who is responsible? 

 BOB CARR: The Department of Immigration. That's… 

 QUESTION: Okay. 

 BOB CARR: [Indistinct] not been any state secret. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, report after report has identified the need  for Australia to open more overseas postings because our diplomatic  footprint isn't big enough, yet you're cutting postings. What's the  rationale for that? 

 BOB CARR: Well, we're closing one - Budapest - because we're can  serve it… 

 QUESTION: And abandoning plans for another. 

 BOB CARR: … we can serve it from two other postings, Warsaw and  Vienna. But hang on, that is to enable us to build a big new  diplomatic establishment in Nairobi and to give us a strongly fortified  embassy in Kabul, which will be required after the events for 2014.  Moreover, we're proceeding with the opening of the embassy in  Senegal, which will end up with an Australian ambassador based  there. 

 The Hungarian post is one of our smallest in Europe. Diplomatic staff  at the embassy will be reassigned to other positions. If you're going  to expand in Africa, if you're going to what we want to do in  Afghanistan, opening new posts in Asia, as we're committed to over  the longer run, given the contraction of revenues, you've got to find  it by making these sorts of choices. 

 QUESTION: Are there other cuts across Asia or the Pacific? 

 BOB CARR: No. 

 QUESTION: In [indistinct]. 

 QUESTION: Will DFAT face job cuts? Will DFAT face further job cuts? 

 BOB CARR: No. My understanding is that it won't. 

 QUESTION: Julie Bishop says that Labor has effectively ended the  bipartisan support of increasing the foreign aid budget. What do you  say to that? 

 BOB CARR: Well, the Opposition needs to make an explicit  commitment here. When will they reach 0.5 per cent? Do they give a  commitment that aid will increase should they win the next election?  I haven't seen that from them. And if so, by what amount? If they're  critical of our priorities, what are their alternative priorities? 

 I mean, we're now in this election - we're now moving well and truly  into the election phase and the Opposition when it comes to  overseas development assistance can't get away with saying they like  the 0.5 per cent but can't tell you when they will get there. 

 QUESTION: DFAT's parlous budgetary position - have you rethought  your opposition to the idea of a consular travel levy? 

 BOB CARR: No. And it's not a parlous budgetary position at all. In  fact, DFAT - the Government is going to allocate, in this Budget, 49.9  million* over seven years to construct a new, more secure high  commission in Kenya. That'll reflect Australia's expanding trade and  investment links with Kenya and East Africa. 

 The Government will provide 215.9 million over seven years to  upgrade and replace the Government's secure international  communications networks. That was a DFAT priority. I was briefed on  it by Peter Varghese. It was very important, the commitment we  made there, and it is. 

 The Government will commit 14.1 million over four years to continue  DFAT's coordination role for the Regional Assistance Mission to the  Solomon Islands. RAMSI's been one of the most successful security  and development operations anywhere in the world, and the funding  will allow DFAT to continue coordinating Australia's leadership with  RAMSI as the Solomon Islands continues its transition towards long-term stability. 

 In addition to that, the Government's going to invest 52.6 million  over three years to construct secure, purpose-built residential  accommodation in Kabul, to provide a more manageable security  environment for Australian staff working in Afghanistan. So the  adjective parlous should be discarded and repudiated, torn up,  stamped on. 

 QUESTION: The use of aid funding for our refugee program - now  that we've done that… 

 BOB CARR: Be more specific. Not refugee program… 

 QUESTION: Okay, well, okay, into our asylum… 

 BOB CARR: Onshore… 

 QUESTION: Onshore asylum. 

 BOB CARR: Onshore sustenance, in accordance with OECD guidelines  and the practice of a raft of other OECD countries. 

 QUESTION: [Indistinct] done it, do you expect this to be something  that continues for many years ahead? 

 BOB CARR: I can't speculate about budgets way out in the future, but  obviously I, any minister in charge of ODA, would argue strongly  against that re-prioritisation. That would not come as a surprise to  any of you. 

 QUESTION: Why would you argue against the reprioritisation, then?  If you say it's a legitimate use of our money, if you say it's completely  in line with what the OECD… 

 BOB CARR: Because I'm wanting to maximise money going on the  ODA programs that excite me and interest me. But we're running a  budget, and we're running a budget without doing the things on jobs  and growth that a Coalition Government would do. Therefore, with  the contraction of revenues, there must be some response. We are  determined not to do what state Coalition Governments have done,  which is slash jobs and growth. Hence the wise budgeting. But I've  got to say, in all this context, a very generous treatment of the ODA  budget. 

 QUESTION: But if you're arguing against the use of money like this,  or if you prefer not to see it go into that, aren't you, in a sense,  admitting that it's against the spirit of our aid program? 

 BOB CARR: No. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, can I just ask you a question on Pakistan  and the election? 

 BOB CARR: Yes. 

 QUESTION: What do you make of Imran Khan's ascertains that they  weren't fair and free elections in Pakistan this weekend? 

 BOB CARR: Well, we're not in a position to judge that, but we can say  that to see a civilian government … [indistinct] or a civilian  government after an election is a gain for Pakistan. I would urge the  new government to take a very keen and sensitive interest in the  religious and ethnic violence that since the start of the year has  claimed at least 200 lives in the country. We want to see a  democratic and stable and economically developing Pakistan without 

 religious ethnic violence, and we think the aspirations of the people  of Pakistan for democracy are the same as those around the world,  in the Arab world, across Asia, right around the globe. And we hope  that this is the start of a more robust democracy in that country, but  one that respects the rights of religious and ethnic minorities in the  country. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, can I ask about Fiji? It's six months since  you announced that Margaret Twomey was to become our High  Commissioner in Fiji. Fiji still hasn't let her in. Is the new era in Fiji-Australian relations over before it even began? 

 BOB CARR: I don't think I'd claimed it was a new era when, in June  last year, we said we'd exchange high commissioners. If Fiji doesn't  want to receive an Australian High Commissioner, that's their loss.  We'll have Margaret Twomey, a highly qualified and indeed  distinguished diplomat working on other things. Fiji is diminished by  not having an Australian High Commissioner there, as I and Foreign  Minister Kubuabola agreed in the middle of the year. If they don't  want a high commissioner, then that diminishes them, not us.
