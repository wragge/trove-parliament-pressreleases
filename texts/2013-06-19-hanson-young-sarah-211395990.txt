 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 19 June 2013   

 Hypocrisy undermines Australia’s bid for seat  on UN Human Rights Council   

 The Australian Government’s announcement that it will bid for a seat on the UN Human Rights  Council is astonishing, considering the egregious treatment it has inflicted upon the rights of  vulnerable people asking for Australia’s protection.   

 “It is frankly unbelievable that this government expects a seat on the Human Rights Council as a  reward for breaching the rights of thousands of vulnerable people,” the Greens’ Human Rights  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The government’s cruel and ineffective refugee policy is an international embarrassment, so  it’s incredible that the Foreign Minister now thinks we can dictate to other countries on human  rights standards.    

 “Indefinite imprisonment, offshore detention, locking up children and refusing refugees their  right to work are just some of the ways this government is thumbing its nose at the Declaration  of Human Rights and other UN conventions.   

 “Despite the government’s flagrant disregard for the human rights of refugees it now thinks it  can swan on to the very committee that oversees those rights.   

 “How does the government plan to explain the 2000 refugee children it currently has locked up  in detention?   

 “The government made this announcement on the same day that the Parliamentary Joint  Committee on Human Rights said that it is concerned Australia is breaching international human  rights obligations in its treatment of refugees.   

 “The Greens know what it takes to stand up for people’s human rights and will continue to work  tirelessly towards a more caring society.”
