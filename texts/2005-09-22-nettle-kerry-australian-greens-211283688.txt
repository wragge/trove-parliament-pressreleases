 Nauru cruelty must end   

 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said today that the government can not claim to have  changed its culture in regard to immigration detention whilst they continue to keep  27 men in limbo on Nauru.   

 "The minister shouldn't need to send a delegation over to Nauru to know that the  continued indefinite detention of these men is cruel," Senator Nettle said.   

 "I was denied the opportunity to visit these men two months ago by Nauruan  authorities but hope to visit the detainees on Nauru in coming months to lend what  support I can to them.   

 "The detention of asylum seekers in Nauru is an example of the Australian  government 's attempts to keep the cruelty of their immigration detention regime  out of the public eye.    

 "These men should be brought to Australia and either given visas or have their  asylum claims assessed whilst they live in the community."
