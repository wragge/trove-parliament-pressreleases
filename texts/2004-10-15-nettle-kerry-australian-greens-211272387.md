 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales    

 Howard's policy of cruel deportation to  vicious regimes continues 

 15th Oct 2004 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today labelled the actions of the Prime  Minister, Minister for Immigration and DIMIA officials responsible for  the forced deportation of a man to Iran yesterday as 'unconscionable  acts of cruelty.'   

 The Iranian man was snatched from his church service in Baxter  Detention Centre yesterday with no chance to farewell his friends and  forcibly deported to Iran where DIMIA officials admit they have no  intention of monitoring his treatment on arrival.   

 "The deportation of asylum seekers to regimes infamous for their  human rights abuses, which we know pose a real threat to the safety  of these individuals, represents a wilful act of cruelty in the name of  spurious policy objectives," Senator Nettle said.   

 "I have asked the Minister to cease the practice of deporting failed  asylum seekers to dangerous countries but it appears that, post  election, the Minister has resumed business as usual.   

 "We know that some asylum seekers deported from Australia are  beaten, tortured and in some cases have been killed or disappeared.  The Minister has the blood and suffering of these victims on her hands  and must be called to account.   

 "The Greens will be continuing to raise the awareness in the  community of these inhumane acts and put the maximum pressure on  the government to change this cruel policy."
