 Media Centre  Call for Settlement Grants Programme  applications 

 21 September 2007 

 Organisations helping to settle refugees and other migrants in the  Australian community are encouraged to apply for the 2008-09  Settlement Grants Programme (SGP) round. 

 Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Teresa  Gambaro, said a total of $32 million was available under the  Government's SGP with approximately $22 million of that total  available for new projects.  

 'The grants will assist migrants participate in, and contribute to,  Australian society,' Ms Gambaro said. 

 'This means that SGP services will help participants acquire life  skills and knowledge which they require to access mainstream  services and settle successfully in Australia.' 

 'The Government encourages community development through  projects which bring together people's knowledge, skills, personal  networks and enthusiasm.' 

 Applications for funding under the Settlement Grants Programme  will close on October 26, 2007. Successful applicants are  expected to be notified in May 2008.
