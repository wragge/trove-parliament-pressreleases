 SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE

 Asylum report a step in the right direction,  refugee intake must be increased: Greens    

 The Australian Greens have welcomed the release of Beyond the Boats: building an asylum and  refugee policy for the long term, and called for cross-party support for a bill that would increase  Australia’s refugee intake.   

 “This report has some crucial, and very welcome, recommendations,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The Greens currently have a bill before the Senate that would see Australia’s humanitarian  intake increased to a modest 20,000 places per year. I call on any member of Parliament, from  any side of politics, to join me in co-sponsoring this bill.    

 “By working together, across party lines, we can achieve a positive and lasting outcome for  asylum seekers in Australia.    

 “Towbacks don’t save lives, they simply moves the grave stones. What we need to do is find  ways for more refugees to reach protection in Australia safely.    

 “Increasing Australia’s refugee intake and engaging in better in-country processing are  important first steps.     

 “The refugee debate in Australia has sunk to new lows in recent years. This report will hopefully  be the first step along the road to a genuine and lasting regional solution.”
