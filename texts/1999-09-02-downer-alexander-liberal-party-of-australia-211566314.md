  MEDIA RELEASE

  AUSTRALIAN AID WORKERS RELEASED

  

  I am very pleased to announce that a short time ago Steve Pratt and 
Peter Wallace were released from the Sremska Mitrovica prison outsi de 
Belgrade into the care of Australia’s Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Mr 
Chris Lamb.

  

 Their release follows the granting of clemency by 
President Milosevic after intensive representations from the Australian, 
other governments and a number of official and non-government organisations. 
The President’s decision was conveyed to me last week by the Yugoslav 
Ambassador in Australia.

  

 This is a moment of great joy and relief for the two 
men, their families and all those who have worked so hard over the past 
five months for their release. I am sure all Australians will be delighted 
with this news. Mr Pratt and Mr Wallace are now expected to return to 
Australia.

  

 In recent weeks following the appeal process in the 
Yugoslav legal system, the Australian Government redoubled its efforts 
to secure the men’s release. My discussions with the Yugoslav Ambassador 
in recent days followed my further representations to Foreign Minister 
Jovanovic earlier in August and the Prime Minister’s letter in support 
of clemency to President Milosevic.

  

 At the request of the Yugoslav Government, I sent 
three Australians from the Serbian community, Mr Ilija Glisic, Mr Goran 
Petrovic and Mr Nikola Stojadinovic to participate in the release ceremony. 
Two other Australians of Serbian background who were in Belgrade at 
the time also participated.

  

 In the light of his heavy involvement in the campaign 
for the men’s release as the Government’s special envoy, I also 
sent Malcolm Fraser to Belgrade to be present at the prison for the 
release.

  

 A great many people were involved in the campaign 
to bring about the men’s release. I thank in particular the Governor-General, 
Sir William Deane for his efforts in his capacity both as Governor-General 
and Patron of CARE Australia. I thank also Malcolm Fraser for his tireless 
work over the last five months, as well as Ambassador Lamb, Embassy 
staff and Departmental officials who have worked on this case since 
the men were first detained on 31 March. Many members of the Serbian 
community have also made helpful representations supporting release.

  

 On the international front we were able to build one 
of the most effective international coalitions ever assembled by an 
Australian government in support of their case.

  

 The Government is grateful to the Secretary General 
of the United Nations Mr Kofi Annan, the former South Mrican President 
Mr Nelson Mandela, President Ahtisaari of Finland, Greek Foreign Minister 
Papandreou and the Greek Government, United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees Mrs Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights Mrs Mazy Robinson, Russian Envoy Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, 
the Reverend Jesse Jackson, former US President Mr Jimmy Carter, former 
US Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger, and other members of the international 
community who have assisted the Australian Government on this case.

  

 The men’s release removes a major impediment to 
our relations with Yugoslavia and will be welcomed by the many Australians 
who have family ties in Serbia.
