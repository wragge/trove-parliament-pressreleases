 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER   

 FA 4   14 January 2004 

 

 ADDITIONAL HELP FOR NAURU’S HEALTH SERVICES   

 I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide assistance to strengthen Nauru’s health  services capacity to respond to medical contingencies at the Offshore Processing Centre  (OPC).     

 This follows meetings this week in Nauru between a delegation of senior Australian officials  and Nauru’s Acting President, Derog Gioura, and key government of Nauru officials  including the director of Nauru’s health services Dr Kieren Keke.    

 The package of measures could include: supplementation of medical and nursing staff;  provision of additional emergency services equipment and supplies; further support for the  improvement of the hospital infrastructure, including additional ward capacity for emergency  situations; and further training to enhance emergency care.   

 Under the Memorandum of Understanding Between Australia and Nauru for Cooperation in  the Management of Asylum Seekers and related Issues, Australia is committed to provide  assistance to improve Nauru’s health services, which benefits the local population, as well as  Nauru’s capacity to provide medical services to the OPC residents when needed.   

 Australia values Nauru’s cooperation in the management of the residents of the Offshore  Processing Centre.  I welcome Nauru’s strong commitment to continue that cooperation.    

 Australia  remains committed to working with Nauru to address its broader development  challenges in a sustainable way.
