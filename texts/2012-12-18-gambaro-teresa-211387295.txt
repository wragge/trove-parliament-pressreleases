 Media Release   

 18 December 2012 

 It’s official - Labor hijacks foreign aid!   

 Shadows Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, Teresa Gambaro has  slammed the Gillard Government’s hijacking of Australian’s foreign aid program as the inevitable  result of endemic policy failures on border security, settlement services and skewed foreign aid  priorities.   

 “The Coalition has been warning for months that Labor was set to hijack Australia’s foreign aid  program to pay for the gigantic mess it has made with its failed border security policies and we have  not seen the end of it yet - it will get worse.”   

 Ms Gambaro said Labor’s policy failures in this space made for an abysmal report card:   

 ï· border security - more than 31,000 arrivals since November 2007 and a $6.6 billion budget  blow out - fail;  ï· settlement services - record number of arrivals overwhelming service providers, an  additional $1.3 billion in expenditure recommended by Houston Report, asylum seekers 

 being housed in backpackers accommodation and commercial buildings - fail;   ï· Labor’s skewing of foreign aid priorities to buy votes for the United National Security Council  (UNSC) bid - fail; and  ï· Labor’s false promise to the nations of the world that it would increase Australia’s foreign 

 aid budget to 0.5% of GNI by 2015 as part of its bid to secure votes for a UNSC seat - fail.”   

 Ms Gambaro also called on Foreign Minister Carr to come clean on the detail of exactly where the  $375 million in cuts were going to come from.   

 “Where’s the money coming from? This is the universal question that has to be asked whenever the  Gillard Government makes an announcement about anything. It’s a question Australian taxpayers  want an answer to, it’s a question our near neighbours want an answer to, and it’s a question the  rest of the world wants an answer to.   

 “Is it from the health program in Papua New Guinea and the fight against tuberculosis, malaria and  AIDS/HIV in that country? Is it going to come from the $320 million Pacific Women Shaping Pacific  Development initiative that was only announced on August this year? Is it going to come out of  programs tackling infant mortality, maternal health and domestic violence in the South Pacific?”   

 Ms Gambaro also called upon Mr Carr to provide details of the assessment process the Government  would follow in determining which foreign aid projects would be cut and which would survive.
