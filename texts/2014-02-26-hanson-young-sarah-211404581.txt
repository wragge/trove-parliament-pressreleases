 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 26 February 2014   

 Security staff not stood aside on Manus   

 It is unacceptable that the Immigration Department has not undertaken any  process to ensure that staff at the Manus Island detention centre who are  suspected of attacking refugees have been stood aside, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 “Security staff who are suspected of carrying out the attack that night need to be  stood aside until the events, which saw a young man killed, are adequately  investigated,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “If this attack happened in Australia there is no way that this situation would be  tolerated.   

 “Australia is running a lawless gulag on Manus Island and the safety of people in  the Government’s care cannot be guaranteed.   

 “The Manus Island camp must be shut down but, in the short term, security staff  who are suspected of being involved in the attack that night must be stood aside  while an actual independent investigation is carried out.”
