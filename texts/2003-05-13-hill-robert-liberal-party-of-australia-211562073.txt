 MORE MONEY FOR DEFENCE TO MEET NEW STRATEGIC  CHALLENGES   

 In  the  2003-04  Budget  the  Government  will  increase  spending  on  Defence  by    $2.1 billion over the five years from 2002-03 to meet the challenges of the changed  strategic  environment  and  the  increased  tempo  of  Australian  Defence  Force   operations, Defence Minister Robert Hill said.   

 The funding increases Defence’s Budget to more than $15 billion, or about two per  cent  of  Gross  Domestic  Product,  and  continues  the  Howard  Government’s  2000   White Paper commitment to an average real growth in Defence spending of three per  cent over 10 years.   

 Key Budget initiatives include: 

 â¢ An extra $1,145.1 million over five years from 2002-03 to boost logistics support  to  the  ADF,  recognising  the  increased  repair,  maintenance,  training  and   operating costs of our high operational tempo.   

 â¢ An extra $644.7 million over three years to meet the estimated additional costs  of  Australia’s  contribution  to  the  coalition  to  disarm  Iraq  (Operations  Bastille   and  Falconer)  and  Defence’s  contribution  to  stabilisation  and  recovery   operations  (Operation  Catalyst).   This  includes  $421  million  provided  in  2002-03.     

 â¢ An  extra  $156.8  million  over  four  years  to  establish  a  new  Special  Operations   Command  that  will  enhance  Australia’s  ability  to  respond  to  terrorist  threats   and boost Special Forces personnel numbers by about 330.   

 â¢ An extra $102.8 million over three years to recruit more military personnel and  improve  retention  rates  in  the  Australian  Defence  Force,  accelerating  growth   towards the White Paper target of 54,000.   

 â¢ An extra $70.7 million over two years to continue to enhance security at Defence  bases  around  Australia  through  increased  guarding,  patrolling  and  protective   searches.   

 â¢ An  extra  $17.8  million  to  continue  to  protect  Australia’s  northern  approaches   through Operation Relex II.   This is in addition to the $18.7 million provided in  2001-02  and  $22.3  million  in  2002-03  to  deter  people  smugglers  and   unauthorised boat arrivals.    

 Defence  will  spend  $3.065  billion  in  2003-04  on  approved  major  capital  projects   that will increase Australian Defence Force capabilities.  In addition $358 million is  planned for expenditure on new major capital projects and new phases of existing  projects.   

 Senator  Hill  said  the  2003-04  Defence  Budget  reflected  the  reshaping  of  the   Australian Defence Force to meet the challenges of the new strategic environment,  as highlighted by the 2003 Defence Update.

 “The extra money will be spent on ensuring the ADF is well-equipped, flexible and  well-prepared  to  defend  Australia  and  able  to  operate  in  coalitions,”  Senator  Hill   said.
