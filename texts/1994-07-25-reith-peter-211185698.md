 JOINT PRESS RELEASE

 MR PETER REITH, MP, SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE MR BILL TAYLOR, EP, ACTING SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 RWANDA

 4,k

 The Shadow Minister for Defence, Mr Peter Reith, MP and the

 Acting Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill Taylor, MP said today that the Government's reaction to the crisis in Rwanda had come very late and could be better directed to those most in need.

 It is now clear that the Government's contribution to the international humanitarian relief effort of $3.5 million, or approximately 0.002% (less than one five hundredth) of Australia's aid budget for 1994/95, is utterly inadequate when measured against the extent of the human tragedy. The Coalition welcomes reports that the Government is considering increasing this amount and urges it to do so without any further delay and to ensure that the assistance is directed to priority needs and to those most at risk.

 But the Government's delay in deciding whether or not to make an Australian Defence Force (ADF) contribution to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) indicated confusion and indecision in the face of a crisis which called for decisiveness

 and rapid action in order to save lives. Two months after the Government had first been approached by the UN to contribute, the Government now appeared to be nerving itself up to dispatch an ADF medical team to Kigali. Even if the Government does decide to do so, it could be several weeks before the team could be on the ground in Kigali.

 The public was entitled to know why it was that the New Zealand Defence Forces were able to send a Hercules aircraft to assist in relief efforts and Australian civilian medical personnel were able to leave for Central Africa almost immediately, whilst the ADF, despite months of warning, could not be deployed for some

 further weeks?

 A deployment to Kigali to support UN troops would not help the refugees in Zaire. Whilst it was important for Australia to contribute to UNAMIR, the ADF should also be deployed immediately to assist the refugees. The ADF could help with transport and engineering skills to assist in the provision of clean water,

 food and medical supplies direct to the refugees.
