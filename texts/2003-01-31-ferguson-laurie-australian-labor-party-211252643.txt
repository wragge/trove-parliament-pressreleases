 Shadow Minister For Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 LAURIE FERGUSON MP 

 31 January 2003    

 N EW Y EA R GR E E T IN G S F OR C H I N E SE A N D V I E TNAM E S E AU S T R A L IAN S 

 On behalf of the Opposition, I extend best wishes to members of our Chinese and  Vietnamese communities who are celebrating their Lunar New Year this weekend. 

 

 Australia is home to more than 550,000 people of Chinese ancestry, and more than  150,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry. To this number must be added the many  overseas students who are in Australia to further their educational and career goals. 

 

 Chinese Australians come from diverse backgrounds. Many can trace their family  history in Australia back several generations, with Chinese migration to Australia  commencing in the mid-1800s. Others have arrived more recently from places such  as mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.  

 

 Vietnamese migration to Australia is characterised by two distinct phases, with  substantial refugee arrivals between 1975 and 1985, followed by family reunion. The  second generation, which is Australian born and educated, now represents a growing  proportion of Australia’s Vietnamese community.  

 

 I acknowledge the contribution that our Chinese and Vietnamese communities make  to Australia’s cultural, social and economic life, as they strive to build a better life for  themselves and their families. I wish them well in their New Year celebrations over  coming days. I know they will see these festivities as a time of family togetherness,  in which they display respect for their ancestors and their traditions and customs,  while hoping for good fortune and prosperity in the year ahead.  

 

 It is a telling reality of Australia’s changing nature that I and many other  parliamentarians will participate in these festivities both with our personal friends  and in our civic roles.
