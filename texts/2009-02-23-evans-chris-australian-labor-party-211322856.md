 Funding to support displaced people vulnerable to smugglers 

 Monday, 23 February 2009 

 The Rudd Government will provide $12.8 million for overseas assistance projects to  support displaced people fleeing wars, persecution or political strife in their  homelands and help reduce their vulnerability to people smuggling. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said the  Australian Government’s Displaced Persons Program for 2009 will focus on  displaced Afghans, Iraqis, Burmese and Sri Lankans. 

 ‘Most of the 17 international projects to be funded are aimed at reducing the demand  for irregular migration and preventing secondary movement at its source,’ Senator  Evans said. 

 ‘The projects offer immediate support to help stabilise displaced populations and  reduce opportunities for people smugglers to prey upon the vulnerability of these  people.’ 

 The funding will enable organisations like the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), CARE Australia and the International Organization for Migration  (IOM) to undertake projects that will provide assistance, support and protection to  thousands of displaced people and help them return to their homelands.  

 Projects to receive funding include: 

 â¢ $1.9 million for UNHCR and IOM to facilitate the  voluntary return of Afghan refugees from Pakistan  and support their sustainable reintegration in safe  areas of Afghanistan  

 â¢ $756 000 for CARE Australia to help Afghan  women return safely to their homes   â¢ $1.6 million to enable UNHCR to register and  assist up to 40 000 Iraqi refugees in Syria   â¢ $742 000 for UNHCR to improve asylum seeker 

 processing in Indonesia and reduce potential for  exploitation by people smugglers   â¢ $772 000 for IOM to deliver humanitarian relief to  people in the north of Sri Lanka, and   â¢ $484 000 for UNHCR to build new shelters for 

 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  

 Senator Evans said UNHCR estimates that two million Iraqis had fled to  neighbouring countries in the past five years while another 2.8 million people were  displaced within Iraq.  

 There are also some 3.5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, up to 200 000  Burmese refugees in Bangladesh, while in Sri Lanka more than half-a-million people  have been displaced by the internal conflict. 

 ‘Ongoing pressures in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sri Lanka in particular create significant  push factors for irregular migration as people seek refuge in safe countries,’ Senator  Evans said. 

 ‘Australia’s funding will help provide effective assistance and protection to vulnerable  people and reduce the potential for exploitation by people smugglers.’ 

 Senator Evans said the Displaced Persons Program underlined Australia’s  commitment to assisting refugees and complemented the humanitarian program  intake of 13 500 people.   See: Displaced Persons Program 2009
