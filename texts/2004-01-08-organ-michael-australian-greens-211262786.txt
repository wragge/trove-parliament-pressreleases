 GOVERNMENT URGED TO ACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS  ABUSES IN ACEH   

 Cunningham MP Michael Organ is urging the Federal government to  press Indonesian authorities to ensure that two human rights workers  arrested in Aceh receive the full protection of the law.   

 “I have today written to Foreign Minister Alexander Downer seeking his urgent  assistance in relation to two members of the People’s Crisis Centre in Aceh who  were arrested by Indonesian military forces last month”, Mr. Organ said.   

 “The People’s Crisis Centre (PCC ACEH) is a humanitarian institution that  assists the victims of armed conflict, and it concentrates on helping refugees,  especially women and children, and on rebuilding Aceh’s devastated social  structure after armed conflict.”   

 “On Monday, 15 December 2003 the Indonesian National Army (TNI),  accompanied by Cuak (the local people in Aceh who work with TNI as  informants), arrested 26 year old Yusni Abdullah. Mr Abdullah was working as a  volunteer with PCC, and at the time was sleeping in the office and his neighbour  woke him up.  Later the same day the TNI also arrested another PCC activist, 24  year old Mahyiddin, at his cafÃ© shop.”   

 “I believe that these two people have been held incommunicado since that time,  denied contact with other members of PCC, and with their own families.”   

 “Incidents like these do nothing to give me confidence in the way in which  Indonesian armed forced are operating in the troubled province of Aceh, and I  have also asked that the Australian government seek to ensure that international  humanitarian organisations are given full access to the province”, Mr. Organ  said.
