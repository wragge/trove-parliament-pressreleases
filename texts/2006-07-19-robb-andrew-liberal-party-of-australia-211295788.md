  I he SGP provides funding to community organisations to deliver flexible, responsive settlement  services which address the needs of newly arrived refugees and migrants 

  ’ 1 he changes the Government is considering include the fundmg of a range of additional practical  projects to more quickly integrate new migrants into the Australian community These would include  projects such as driver education, employment mentoring, homework clubs, household budgetmg and  sporting activities for the young,” Mr Kobb said 

  “1 he fastest way for refugees and migrants to succeed in thelr new lives is to ensure they have a  functional grasp of the English language and other skills necessary to integrate into the broader  Australian society 

  -‘ 1 he Settlement Grants Programme assists new entrants to become self-sufficient and become  comfortable with day-to-day activities such as shopping in supermarkets, accessing medical services  and understanding day to day events going on around them 

  “By helping provide these skills we are helping people prosper in their new home .. 

  Mr Kobb was the keynote speaker at the conference attended by ethnic community leaders, settlement  service providers, legal experts, health and education providers and State and Commonwealth  government representatives 

  Ivk Robb thanked all the stakeholders who had provided valuable input to the changes being  considered tor the programme. 

  “1 believe Australia’s migrant resource centres and agencies, and other settlement support  oIganisations will welcome these proposed changes,” he said 

  “Some of the changes to the programme under consideration include a greater emphasis on Australia’s  newest arrivals, those who had been here two years or less, and a simpler, more streamlined process  for organisations applying for funding.”
