 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s great to be here on the banks of the Tamar with Andrew Nikolic our candidate for Bass to announce a  Coalition Government will provide $2.5 million to clean up the Tamar, in particular to address the silt issues  which obviously you can see right behind us. We are serious about environmental remediation. Yes, it's  important to reduce emissions but it's also important to take practical steps to improve our environment. So  as well as the $2.5 million to improve the health of the Tamar, there will also be a Green Army team  working on the South Esk between Kings Bridge and Duck Reach. This will be doing remediation work on  the bank, fencing, weed removal and so on.    

 I'm about practical steps to help our environment and these are two practical steps forward here in the  electorate of Bass. This is what our real solutions plan is all about. It's about real action to make a real  difference to people's lives. It's the polar opposite to the kind of all talk, no action approach that we get from  this current Labor Government, particularly now that Mr Rudd is back in charge and while I am on that  subject I just want to point out that there have now been some 800 illegal arrivals by boat since Mr Rudd  made his announcement that everyone would go to PNG last Friday. So, Mr Rudd can talk and talk and talk  but the boats just come and come and come. And right now the capacity of the Manus Island detention  centre is about 300. So, the existing capacity has been completely swamped by the numbers of people who  have arrived and for all of Mr Rudd's talk as yet not a single one of those arrivals has actually gone to  Manus. Now, if Mr Rudd expects the people smugglers to take him seriously, he's got to actually turn words  into actions. He's actually got to be able to more than simply announce things, he's got to be able deliver  things and Mr Rudd on past form, on present form, is all announcement and no delivery.    

 I've got Andrew Nikolic here beside me, our candidate for Bass. We've got great candidates running for the  Liberal Party throughout Tasmania, we've got Eric Hutchinson in Lyons, we've got Brett Whiteley up the  road in Braddon, Bernadette Black in Franklin and we’ve recently got Tanya Denison for Denison. I’ve got  to say I'm particularly proud of Andrew Nikolic he has served his country in our armed forces. He was a  senior commander with our forces in Iraq and elsewhere. He served our country in uniform, I know he will 

 2 

 

 do a great job serving our country in the Parliament and I will now ask him to say a few words before I take  some questions.   

 ANDREW NIKOLIC:   

 Thanks, Tony. Can I just say how great it is to have Tony back talking about projects in northern Tasmania.  Can I also say how proud I am to have a healthy Tamar River on page 46 of what is a strategic national  document and underlying that strategic aspiration is real action and real solutions. $2.5 million for a  healthier Tamar which importantly is no longer conditional on matching funding from a State Labor/Greens  Government that has failed our river for years. We've got the project that was announced this morning, the  Kings Bridge to Duck Reach Green Army project. We've got a basin to coast plan that Greg Hunt talked  about when he was in Launceston a while ago sitting down with key stakeholders to determine those  medium and long-term priorities for a healthy Tamar River. I want to be a champion for the Tamar River  and I'm so pleased that our leader, Tony Abbott, in this national document acknowledges our interests and  aspirations for that healthy river. Thank you, Tony.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks so much, Andrew. Ok, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 What about the $200 million problem facing the river which is untreated sewage going into it. The council  wants federal funding for that too, will you commit that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I accept that there is a problem. I accept that over the years TasWater has perhaps not upgraded  infrastructure as it needed to be. I'm happy to keep looking at that but, you know, let's do one problem at a  time. Let's address one issue at a time. Today we're addressing the issue of siltation of the Tamar and should  we form a government I'm sure we will come back to other issues such as the sewage issue.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] for the silt what will be done?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Essentially the Tamar Flood Authority has developed a new and much more cost effective way of doing this.  Essentially you stir it up and it gets taken out to sea by the ebb tide. It's much, much more cost effective than  traditional dredging.   

 QUESTION:   

 It’s not a long term solution though is it, ultimately we will be back to where we started?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well this will ensure that a river that has been neglected for the best part of a decade, because of  Labor/Green Government, will once more be returned to reasonable health and this is going to ensure that a  decade or more of neglect from Labor/Green governments is addressed. Now is it going to address this  problem for all time? Well, no, because as long as European civilisation has existed in this part of the world  we have had this issue of siltation here in the Tamar. It is a naturally occurring problem. It does have to be 

 3 

 

 addressed on a recurring basis. It hasn't been addressed on a recurring basis for a decade or so and we're  going to do it.   

 QUESTION:   

 There's some speculation that the Government will abandon its surplus to give it a bit more spending room.  When will an Abbott government get back to surplus?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We would get back to surplus as quickly as possible but we don't know the situation that we would inherit.  What we do know is that none of this Government's figures have turned out to be true. None of this  Government's forecasts are really believable. Let's never forget that this Government, starting with Mr Rudd,  back in the 2010 Budget, promised until it was blue in the face that there would be a surplus in the 2012-13  financial year. Instead of giving us a surplus they gave us a $20 billion deficit and now the Cabinet is split,  the election is potentially going to be put off even longer because there is a crisis in Cabinet over economic  policy.   

 QUESTION:   

 And just as a follow up, would you be prepared to have your costings looked at by Treasury in the lead up to  an election?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, we understand that the Parliamentary Budget Office will be looking at policies and will be costing  policies and we will have a process for ensuring the Australian people can be confident that our policies are  accurate and all of that will be well and truly before the Australian people in good time before the election.   

 QUESTION:   

 Joe Hockey says he doesn’t trust [inaudible] the election forecast and how will you cost them if [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Joe was making the point that figures from this Government have never turned out to be true. Never, never,  never. Starting from their very first Budget when they promised I think a $22 billion surplus and they ended  up bringing in a $30 billion or thereabouts deficit and from there on they've given us the five biggest deficits  in Australian history. So you just can't trust Labor's numbers and as I said, right now there is apparently a  split in the Cabinet over the fundamental direction of economic policy. Quite likely the election will be put  off even further because this Government cannot get its economic policy right. The basic problem with this  Government is that it doesn't understand that you've got to live within your means. When Kevin Rudd was  Prime Minister first time around they were borrowing $100 million every day. Now, they're borrowing $50  million every single day and this just can’t go on.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Rudd handed out a fair bit more than $2.5 million yesterday, about $100 million, if you're elected will  you maintain those payments over the forward estimates?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We're certainly not in the business of breaking contractual arrangements and I'm not in the business of  begrudging hard-pressed local businesses some government support, but let's remember what these 

 4 

 

 payments are for. These payments are essentially compensation for closing down the forest industry and that  is a tragedy for Tasmania, a disaster for Tasmania. I want the forestry industry to have a future, not just a  past and as far as I'm concerned if we're going to be supporting business, it's going to be supporting business  to grow, not to shrink and that's the tragedy of these payments.   

 QUESTION:   

 Is that a bit misleading though given some of the money’s actually going to forestry projects. You say  they're shutting it down, but there is a new plywood mill in the wings?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, if you look at what the industry experts are saying, they're saying that under the policies of the  Labor/Green Government in Hobart and the Labor/Green Government in Canberra what has traditionally  been a $1.4 billion a year industry, will shrink to about $700 million a year, but frankly under these sorts of  policies it is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller with each passing year because Labor/Green  governments, instead of loving forestry as a way of having sustainable, clean green industries, they hate  forestry and they want to close it down.   

 QUESTION:   

 Did Kevin Rudd consult with Indonesia before announcing his PNG Solution?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, Mr Rudd has a pretty bad track record when it comes to working with Indonesia. Ever since he totally  mishandled the Oceanic Viking issue back in 2009, the Indonesians, it seems have had difficulties working  with Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd has had difficulties. The important thing is to have a no-surprises, no-excuses  approach, and that's the approach that the Coalition will bring. That's why before we officially launched our  latest border protection initiative latest border protection initiative yesterday, Julie Bishop, as a courtesy,  informed the Indonesian ambassador of what we had in mind.   

 QUESTION:    

 The Government says that your policy is just an organisational restructure that won't have any real impact in  stopping the stopping the boats. What's your response to that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, it's important that you've got the policy right, but you've also got to have the implementation right as  well. It is one thing it make an announcement. It is another thing to actually get the delivery right, and this is  a government which has consistently willed the end, but never the means. It has been hopeless at actually  getting things done. It thinks that when you've put that press release you've done the job. Well, to do the job,  you've got to have the right structures and the difficulty that we've had or one of the many difficulties we've  had in border protection is no clear lines of command, no clear lines of authority, a whole lot of people all  with fingers in the same pie and no-one quite sure who is really in charge, and that's why we're going to  make sure that this mess is fixed. And the best way to ensure that a very difficult problem, what constitutes a  national emergency on our borders is addressed, is with clear lines of command and control with a three-star  military officer running the operation.   

 QUESTION:    

 The Defence Force Association has concerns, though. Are they legitimate concerns and will you meet with  them to address those concerns? 

 5 

 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I respect Neil James and I respect the work he does. From time to time I do meet with him. I know my  colleagues liaise with him quite regularly, but you know, I announced that policy yesterday, standing  shoulder to shoulder with retired General Jim Molan. General Molan was the operations officer for the  American Army in Iraq at the time of some of its largest operations there in Fallujah and elsewhere. There  are very few recent Australian soldiers with as much operational experience running complex manoeuvres,  complex operations as General Molan, and General Molan obviously has given this initiative from the  Coalition his seal of approval, and as I said, if Jim Molan thinks it can work, I'm very happy to be the  advocate and the ultimate authority for this particular policy.   

 QUESTION:    

 Can you just clarify what will happen with the Gonski reforms if you win government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the point I keep making is that no school will be worse off, and we're not in the business of adding to  the tremendous uncertainty which this government has created, but I just want to make this fundamental  point: you talk about Gonski reforms. Well, which Gonski? Because there is a separate Gonski for New  South Wales, a different Gonski for South Australia, a different Gonski for Tasmania, a different Gonski for  the ACT, so all of these things are going to have to be re-negotiated because everyone has the right to a deal  which is at least as advantageous as every other deal. So, we really don't know where the Government is at  with this. They haven't come clean with the Australian people. The point I make is we are not going to add  to the uncertainty. We're not going to undo done deals at the start of next year but we think that serious adult  government does not operate the way this government has, which is basically to hold a gun to the head of  the states and say, "sign up or else."    

 QUESTION:    

 When you say renegotiations, does that mean you are going to break it all down and start again?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We are going to work, should we have the opportunity after the election, we will continue to work  constructively with the states, to come up with arrangements which genuinely do improve our schools and  which are affordable for the long term, but arrangements that have been put in place for the start of next year  are not going to be disturbed by the Coalition.    

 Thank you.
