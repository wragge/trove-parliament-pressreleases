 Albanese right on uranium - Brown 

 Senator Brown, 25th July 2006 

 Labor voters offered Green haven  

 Labor's environment spokesperson Anthony Albanese's policy of phasing out uranium  mining is morally right and will find strong backing from party members, Greens  Leader Bob Brown said in Hobart today. 

 "If Anthony fails, there will be a big swap to the Greens from Labor supporters fed up  with Kim Beazley's pursuit of John Howard on uranium. The Greens have a stronger  parliamentary record than Beazley on the workplace and refugees, so the Greens offer  disgruntled Labor voters a logical haven. We will campaign strongly to keep Australia  nuclear-free in next year's election," Senator Brown said.
