 Media Release

 13 May 2003

 Budget 2003-2004 - Joint Statement -  Minister for Foreign Affairs, The Hon  Alexander Downer, and Minister for  Trade, The Hon Mark Vaile

 Contributing to the security of Australians

 In this Budget the Government has announced a  number of measures to enhance the Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade’s capacity to respond to  deterioration in the international environment, including  the increased threat of terrorist attacks. 

 Secure travel

 To better protect Australians overseas, the Government  has committed additional funding of $9.8 million over  four years to improve awareness of security issues  associated with overseas travel. The Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade will implement a  comprehensive public information campaign to ensure  all Australians intending to travel are informed about  travel advice and how to access it. The campaign will  involve promotions through various media, in airports,  post offices and passport offices. 

 In addition, we will make access to travel advisories  easier by placing consular kiosks with touchscreen  access to travel advisories in public areas such as  passport issuing offices, major post offices and 

 international airports. We will improve electronic  delivery of travel advisories via a consolidated system  comprising website, e-mail, fax, and sms mobile phone  messaging to travellers, and webmail delivery to travel  agents. 

 A further element of this initiative will be enhanced  cooperation with the travel industry in encouraging  travellers to consult travel advisories. By working with  industry in support of our shared interest in promoting  safe travel, we will ensure Australians are well informed  about, and prepared for, travel from the time they book  or purchase their ticket. 

 Secure passports

 The Government will commit a further $3 million in  2003-04 to continue research into a biometric identifier  for the Australian passport. The introduction of a  biometric identifier has the potential to strengthen  border protection and reduce significantly the possibility  of terrorists and other undesirables using a fraudulently  obtained Australian passport to enter Australia. 

 The research will build on that undertaken with funding  provided in the 2002-03 Budget. The results of this  research have been very encouraging and show that  facial biometrics matching is effective in detecting  people who have applied for a passport under a false  identity. It will allow Australia to stay at the forefront of  international developments relating to this technology. 

 Secure communications

 The Government has committed $9.4 million in 2003-04  to enhance Australia’s secure international diplomatic  communications network. The network covers Australian  posts in the South Pacific, Asia, the Americas, Europe,  the Middle East, and Africa. 

 The network, which serves the whole of Government, 

 ensures sensitive information can be communicated  between Australia and our overseas posts securely and  reliably. It provides a platform for new crisis  management systems implemented in response to the  Bali and September 11 terrorist attacks. 

 Deterioration in the international security environment,  and our increased alliance responsibilities in responding  to it, have made the need for a global secure  communications network greater and more urgent. 

 Re-establishment of an Australian Diplomatic  Presence in Iraq

 The Government has committed $24.8 million over five  years to re-establish an Australian Mission in Baghdad. 

 Establishment of an Australian Representative Office is  indicative of Australia’s commitment to developing its  bilateral relationship with Iraq, and participating in the  continuing development of Iraq. Iraq will be an  important power in the Middle East in years to come, a  region of significant strategic importance to Australia. It  will enable Australia to advance its commercial,  security, immigration and humanitarian interests in post-conflict Iraq. 

 The mission will help advance important Australian  trade interests. Australia already has strong commercial  interests in Iraq, supplying 90 per cent of its wheat  market, and Australian business has expressed interest  in opportunities in a range of other sectors.

 Continuation of Australia’s Temporary Presence in  Nauru

 The Government will provide $1.7 million to continue  Australia’s diplomatic presence in Nauru for a further  year, to support and facilitate the work of Australian  Government agencies in processing asylum seekers.  The Consulate-General provides a central point of 

 contact for official dealings with Nauru and is necessary  for the smooth functioning of the facilities. 

 Aid Highlights

 In 2003-04 the Australian Government will provide  $1.894 billion as Official Development Assistance  (ODA), an increase of $79 million over the 2002-03  figure of $1.815 billion. The ratio of Australia’s ODA to  Gross National Income (GNI) for 2003-04 is estimated  at 0.25 per cent, placing Australia above the donor  average which, in the latest year available (2002), is  0.23 per cent.

 The Australian aid program will continue to place a high  priority on promoting development in the Asia Pacific  region, with a focus on good governance and enhancing  partner governments’ capacity to promote peace and  manage non-military threats to security.

 Australia will increase total aid flows to the Pacific to  $176 million, including the establishment of a Peace and  Security Fund to provide flexible and targeted  assistance to post-conflict societies such as the Solomon  Islands. Total aid flows to Indonesia will increase by $30  million to $152 million, to support improved  governance, counter-terrorism and more effective  delivery of basic services. Other initiatives include a  major program to improve the quality and accessibility  of mainstream education services and a package of  measures to improve health services as a practical  memorial to the victims of the Bali bombing. Additional  funding will also be provided to support regional counter-terrorism measures in East Asia.

 Funding for international humanitarian, emergency and  refugee programs will increase from last year’s budget  to $132 million. Australia will continue to play a  significant role in the reconstruction of Iraq, particularly  in the area of agriculture. An estimated $94 million will  be provided in 2003-04 towards programs that enhance 

 the sustainable management of water resources and  sanitation services in Australia’s region. Trade-related  assistance to developing countries will increase by  approximately 10 per cent, including regional initiatives  for South East Asia and Africa. Beginning in 2003-04,  the Australian Government will pledge $1 billion over  five years towards programs and initiatives that  enhance the food security of people in the developing  world. Australia will make a multi-year commitment of  $16.5 million to the Global Conservation Trust to  provide secure funding for gene banks to conserve plant  and genetic resources for food and agriculture around  the world.
