 Media Release    

 Saturday, 16 April 2016    

 A Better Way Í´  Greens announce plan to  welcome 50,000 refugees a year    

 The Australian Greens have unveiled a bold yet fiscally responsible vision to harness the nation  building capacity that people seeking asylum represent, ahead of the 2016 Federal Election*.    

 By closing the detention camps on Manus Island and Nauru while welcoming 50,000 people seeking  asylum per year, which includes 40,000 under the humanitarian intake and 10,000 under a new    *Z^*l*]*o*o*****Z***(*µ*P*****[**Ã¢*Ã¥*}*P*Ã¥***u*u***U**Ã¶*Z****Ã¢*o***v**¡*}*µ*o******Ã¥*****Ã¶*******Ãª***(****¡***«**(*}*Ã¥**Ã¢***}*Ã¢*o****]*v**}*µ*Ã¥**Ã¥***P*]*}*v**Ã¶*}**Ãª*****l* asylum in Australia.

  The number of people seeking asylum worldwide is at  crisis levels as war and persecution force more people to  leave their homes than ever before. The current approach  by the Australian government, including turning boats  back to Indonesia and detaining people in cruel camps on  Nauru and Manus Island is at a stalemate with people  continuing to languish in detention with no meaningful  prospects of resettlement. The Australian Labor Party  offers no genuine alternative to the government as they  are committed to maintaining offshore processing and  boat turn-backs.   

  The Australian Greens offer a unique proactive alternative  for the fair and efficient assessment and resettlement of  people seeking asylum which ensures they are treated  with respect and dignity and integrated into our  community. Importantly, the Australian Greens policy will  ***v*Ãª*µ*Ã¥****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**Ã¢***}*Ã¢*o***[*Ãª  safety is paramount. By increasing  our humanitarian intake and adequately funding  organisations in the region, the Australian Greens will  create a fair system whereby people*[*Ãª****o***]*u*Ãª****Ã¥*** processed efficiently and they are flown to Australia from  Malaysia and Indonesia. People will no longer face the  impossible choice of getting on a leaky boat.

  A better way for people seeking asylum  Australia says “Welcome”  Close detention camps, create a safe pathway 

  People seeking asylum have been an asset to Australia for  generations and they can help make our country stronger than  it has ever been. Closing the offshore detention camps will let  us save money, while creating a safe way for people to seek  asylum in Australia and helping 50,000 people per year

  > BUDGET IMPLICATIONS  Th*****µ*Ãª*Ã¶*Ã¥***o*]***v*'*Ã¥*****v*[*Ãª**Ã¢*}*o*]***«**¡*}*µ*o*** save more than $160  million over the forward estimates. By shutting down  Manus Island and Nauru, which will save $2.9 billion over  the forward estimates, we can reinvest that money into a  fairer system that helps more people. 

  > BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND OUR  ECONOMY  The Liberal and Labor Parties support locking children in  offshore detention camps, towing people back to danger  on the high seas and subjecting families to mandatory,  indefinite detention in Australia.   

  Those who are in need should have their claims for asylum  assessed and then be resettled in Australia so that they  can be integrated into our community and live in safety.   

  People seeking asylum have a lot to contribute to  Australia and we will offer 10,00*Ã**Z^*l*]*o*o*****Z***(*µ*P*****[**¿*]*Ãª***Ãª* per year, allowing them to build Australian communities  while contributing to our economy.
