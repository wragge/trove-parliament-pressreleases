 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Migration changes from 1 July 

 Changes to immigration processing and fees come into effect from 1 July 2009,  demonstrating the Australian Government's ongoing commitment to legislative  reform and improved service delivery. 

 The bulk of the reforms to the Migration Regulations 1994 and the Australian  Citizenship Regulations 2007 were announced in the May Budget. 

 The cost of some visa application charges and citizenship fees will increase  tomorrow to offset the wider costs associated with the operation of the migration and  temporary entry program. 

 The majority of visa application charges were increased by a flat 20 per cent (no  CPI) and then rounded to the nearest $5 increment.  

 A skilled independent visa first instalment application fee has increased from $2105  to $2525 and a student visa will increase from $450 to $540. Other visas have only  been increased in line with the CPI. For instance, a tourist visa has increased from  $100 to $105 because the tourist visa application fee was substantially increased in  2008-09. 

 Other changes to come into effect from 1 July include: 

 â¢ removing the discrimination between same-sex  and opposite-sex de facto couples and their  children so they will be eligible to apply for all  subclasses of visa which allow spouses and  dependents  

 â¢ allowing subclass 410 retirement visa holders to  apply for a visa which is valid for 10 years and  removes the 20-hour a week work restriction,  allowing them to make a greater contribution to the  community, through, for instance, volunteering.  These visa holders are retirees and their spouses  who want to spend some of their retirement years  in Australia  

 â¢ preventing split contributory parent visa  applications by not allowing a permanent  contributory parent visa holder from sponsoring  their partner or fiancÃ© for a partner or prospective  marriage visa for five years, ensuring they make  the required contribution through the visa  application charge to partially offset the significant  costs of parent migration to the broader community  

 â¢ extending work rights provisions for asylum  seekers so that people who have remained lawful  in Australia and actively engaged with the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship to  resolve their visa status are permitted to work.  Currently only those who apply within 45 days are  granted work rights. Although people will still have  no access to Centrelink benefits, the changes will  alleviate the burden on Australian community and  religious groups who provide support to asylum  seekers.  

 Changes to the people trafficking visa framework also come into effect from 1 July,  including offering to all identified suspected victims of people trafficking who are  unlawful access to a bridging F visa and allowing it to be extended to 45 days, and  including immediate family members of such victims who may be overseas, in the  offer of a witness protection (trafficking) permanent visa. 

 Amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994 and the Australian Citizenship  Regulations 2007 can be viewed on the Department for Immigration and Citizenship  website.  See: www.immi.gov.au/legislation/amendments
