 Media Statement 

 Saturday, 8 February 2014 

 

 Correcting the record - claims of further investigation on allegations of  abuse by Border Protection Command personnel    

 Reports in today’s Fairfax newspapers that “Border Protection officials will make fresh inquiries into  claims that its sailors deliberately burned the hands of asylum seekers” are wrong.    

 No such new inquiry or investigation is underway. The allegations were assessed at the time they  were first made and found to be without foundation.    

 Border Protection Command remains confident its personnel continue to act with the highest levels  of professional conduct in a demanding and difficult environment.    

 Statements on this matter, including the nature of the assessment undertaken into the original  claims, were made by the Commander of Operation Sovereign Borders, LtGen Angus Campbell,  and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, at a media  conference in Canberra on 15 January 2014.      

 Transcripts of this and other media conferences are available on the ACBPS website at  customs.gov.au    

 There has been no change to this position and no request for assistance or information in relation to  this matter has been received from Indonesian authorities or any non-government organisation.     

 No new evidence has been presented which would warrant further action at this time.
