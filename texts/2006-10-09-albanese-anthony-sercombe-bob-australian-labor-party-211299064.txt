 Anthony Albanese MP  Shadow Minister for Environment, Heritage and Water 

 

 Bob Sercombe MP  Shadow Minister for Overseas Aid and Pacific Island Affairs   

 Labor calls for international coalition to accept climate  change refugees   

 It’s in Australia’s national interest that we lead on climate change, not wait  decades to act.     

 While the Minister for Environment accepts Australia “does have a substantial  role to play in helping smaller, less-developed countries” that will be  devastated by rising sea levels, he fails to show leadership.  The Howard  Government does not have a strategy to combat climate change and its  impact on Pacific countries.   

 On  today’s  AM  program,  Senator  Campbell’s  limp  response  was  to  put  off   action: “The major impacts, the long-term impacts, of climate change will take  many decades to unfold.”    

 Pacific countries need a plan now, not when they are already under water.   

 Tuvalu is expected to become uninhabitable within 10 years because of rising  sea levels, not in “many decades” as the Minister said.       

 Pacific countries are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events,  including contamination of their fresh water supplies.   

 Labor supports the Kyoto Protocol and has a comprehensive plan to assist  Pacific countries threatened by climate change.   

 Labor’s policy discussion paper, Our Drowning Neighbours, advocates the  establishment of an international coalition, led by Australia, to accept climate  change refugees from Pacific countries. (Released January 2006)   

 The paper recommends the establishment of a Pacific Climate Change Centre  to monitor climate change, protect fresh water sources and plan for  emergency evacuation where necessary.   

 Labor welcomes the release of today’s report, Australia Responds: Helping  Our Neighbours Fight Climate Change, by a coalition of groups including  Oxfam and World Vision.   

 The report reinforces Labor’s call for urgent action to reduce greenhouse  emissions and highlights the need for climate change to also be addressed  through the aid budget.
