 CREAN:  I’m out at Pine Rivers today to demonstrate the dramatic  decline in bulk billing. Our health system is in crisis. People can’t afford to get  sick, they certainly can’t afford to go to a doctor. Bulk billing has seen a  dramatic decline under John Howard’s stewardship - most notably in the past  two years. Out here in the Pine Rivers area, for example, bulk billing has  declined by 31 per cent in just two years. Across Australia it’s something like  13 per cent.    

 If bulk billing disappears Medicare goes. Universal health coverage as we  know it goes. I asked a few weeks ago, the end of last year, the Prime  Minister, was he aware of the declining rate of bulk billing in this country?  And he said it wasn’t a problem. Well he should come out here and see that it  is a problem.   

 In circumstances in which a family, a mother, goes off to the doctor with the  two kids sick - we all know that if one gets sick they both get sick - having to  pay out here $75 up front and only get $50 back. Little wonder they can’t  afford to go to a doctor. We have to arrest the decline in bulk billing, it has to  be a number one priority and for the Labor Party it will.    

 The solution to this lies in a much better cooperative effort between the state  and Federal Governments. That opportunity was there last Friday for the  Federal Government to engage the debate, to address it, to understand the  problem and to solve it. They didn’t do it, they stayed away from the meeting,  boycotted the meeting. That’s arrogance at its foremost, a belief that this is  not a problem and the further belief that because of the war, the fog of war,  it’s a matter that the government doesn’t have to address. It is an issue that 

  1

 has to be addressed and Labor will address it. I’m here today to highlight the  problem and to make my commitment to ensuring that we do restore bulk  billing as a fundamental entitlement to the Australian community.    

 JOURNALIST:  That’s one of the issues Mr Howard should have his  Ministers look at during the two-day cabinet meeting to focus on domestic  issues?   

 CREAN:   Absolutely, but they won’t be doing it. The Government  demonstrated its concern about this issue by having its Health Minister  boycott a meeting of state health ministers last Friday. John Howard doesn’t  care about this problem, doesn’t think it exists. He should come out here and  bring his Cabinet out here to realise the extent of decline. We’ve got to  restore bulk billing. He won’t do it, we will.    

 JOURNALIST:  On other issues, Mr Downer has gone to Korea, I know you  said something about this prior to this, what moves do you think he should be  making there?   

 CREAN:  I welcome the fact that he’s finally gone up there. The  engagement on the North Korea issue has to be government to government  level. It has to be at the top of the representation. What he also ought to be  doing though is reinvigorating the Canberra Commission - a Commission that  was established by the Labor Party back in 1995-96 and which reported to  this Government. A Commission that had a plan of action for containing  nuclear proliferation and encouraging disarmament. That’s the plan that he  should be going to North Korea with. He should also be going to urge them to  get back in to the UN family. But you can only do that with credibility - if you  believe in the effectiveness of the UN family. And therein is the Government’s  test so far as the Iraq issue is concerned - to get behind the UN to solve the  problem not back the US Coalition of the Willing.    

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Crean, if Australia does become involved in a war on  Iraq, what should our role and responsibility post-war be both in Iraq and in  terms of taking refugees in Australia?   

 CREAN:   This is a very good question. This is something that  fundamentally has to be addressed. As the deadline looms we’ve got to  increasingly turn our minds to what happens in the circumstances of a change  of regime. What happens in circumstances of the humanitarian outpouring  that is going to occur. What steps have been put in place and what usefully  can be done. We have to contribute to the peaceful disarmament, it’s not  good enough to be just committed to war. And the Government has said  nothing on this. It was interesting to note that Mr Downer yesterday on his  way to Korea said that, started to hint that the UN should be involved in the  reconstruction of Iraq. Ironic isn’t it? They don’t want the UN involved in the  war but they want it to clean up the mess. Let’s get some consistency about  it. Do it all through the United Nations, it’s still the path of the peaceful 

  2

 resolution and the disarmament of Iraq. It’s something that has to be looked  at beyond sending in the warplanes.    

 JOURNALIST:  What should our involvement be? Should there be a  financial commitment? Should we take extra refugees?   

 CREAN:  I noted that the Prime Minister has said that we would be  prepared to take our fair share of refugees. I want to know what contingency  planning they’ve made, what numbers they’re looking at and how they intend  to take our fair share.  These are very valid questions that the Government  has to answer. It’s the one that’s hell-bent on going down the path of the  war, what it should be explaining is how it intends to secure the peace.    

 JOURNALIST:  Nevertheless, Labor has supported a war on Iraq if it is  mandated by the UN. If we go in with a UN mandate what should our  involvement be?   

 CREAN:   Then in circumstances in which the UN decides that it has  to go in, so too does the UN have to turn its mind to these questions. But it  would be far better to have been having these discussions through the United  Nations as part of the diplomatic resolution of the issue than undermining the  United Nations authority by backing a Coalition of the Willing which is  essentially a preparedness to go to war outside of the UN resolution.   

 JOURNALIST:  What is your reaction to Dr Mahathir’s `collateral  damages’?   

 CREAN:  Well, I was interested to read what he had to say and  disagreed with him. What I do believe fundamentally is that that sort of  allegation that he’s making can’t be made if the United Nations is the  determinant of the disarmament of Iraq. It was also interesting to see if Mr  Mbeki’s statement at the same conference where he said that the  disarmament of Iraq must occur in accordance with the Untied Nations  resolution. Now I believe if we pursue this through the UN, if we pursue the  diplomatic means, that is the best way forward, the only way forward. And  the sorts of allegations that Dr Mahathir had purported to have made, those  sorts of allegations can’t be made. You can’t say this is West versus Islam if  you have the United Nations behind the authority that is the disarmament.    

 JORUNALIST:  Making claims though that the victims of the Bali Bombings  are collateral damage, that’s insulting.    

 CREAN:  Very offensive, totally insensitive in the circumstances.  What we’ve got to do is to not react to those circumstances, understand the  context in which they’re being made, but importantly, get behind the  authority of the United Nations. I disagreed with what Mahathir had said, but  in the inflammatory circumstances that we’re in, people will say all sorts of  things. It’s not a question of focussing on what one individual says, it’s what 

  3

 the collective strength of the Untied Nations determines. And that’s been a  consistent position that I’ve held and argued since April.    

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think that Malaysia’s potentially a greater threat to  us than Iraq?    

 CREAN:  I don’t put it in terms of threat. I certainly don’t see  Malaysia as a threat to Australia. But, what is the threat is the circumstance in  which a resolution of the United Nations, passed under Chapter 7 -  unanimously determined - is ignored. And that’s why it’s very pleasing today  to see the Untied States and the UK, by way of the new resolution, accepting  that this matter has to be progressed through the United Nations. That is a  welcome development. But the next important step is going to be Dr Blix’s  report on the 1st of March. That, only the weapons inspectors can report on  whether Iraq is in material breach. And that is something that the United  Nations Security Council then has to determine. So, the next important step is  Dr Blix’s report on the 1st of March and in particular, Iraq’s response to the  specific request to disarm and dismantle the extended range missiles that Dr  Blix has written to them about. That’s where we’ve got to keep this focussed.  The weapons inspectors report, the specific response by the Iraqis and then  the determination by the United Nations Security Council.    

 JOURNALIST:  Back to Dr Mahathir, are his comments potentially  inflammatory?   

 CREAN:  Well, they can be portrayed that way but I think that we  have to see them in the full context of the meeting that he’s participating in.  And I was pleased to see the report of Dr Mbeki, the South African President,  in terms of his focus and where they expect the resolution of the non-aligned  countries to emerge. The last thing we want is a circumstance in which a war  is portrayed as the West versus Islam. It’s easier to assert that point, it’s  harder to justify it if the United Nations gets behind the resolution as to the  next step forward. The path forward is through the United Nations, any US-led Coalition of the Willing is going to undermine that authority and we should  not be part of it.    

 JOURNALIST:  On a separate issue of the Government’s Higher Education  blueprint, what do you say about that?   

 CREAN:  This is another strategy to price eduction away from  ordinary Australian families and students wanting to get an education. It’s  another cost shift to the individual, it’s like health care, you’re pricing  education and health care out of the province of ordinary Australian families.  And we as a nation that prides ourselves on our education and our health  system should not be going down that path. We must aspire to affordable  health and education in this country for all Australians. And that’s a policy  direction that I’ll be leading to the election.

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Crean, we see overnight that the Australian Dollar has  pushed through 60 cents, surely that must be good news for Australia?   

 CREAN:  Well it’s certainly about time isn’t it? The Dollar has been  languishing around about, down at the 50 cent level last year for a  considerable amount of time. And that’s because, I argued at the time,  Australia was not demonstrating its belief in its own capacity, its  preparedness to build the nation and strengthen the economy. If we don’t  believe in it, if we’re not prepared to invest in ourselves, why should the rest  of the world? What we seem to be benefiting from, at the moment, is the pick  up in commodity prices consequent upon a view that there is going to be  increased demand for those commodities and particularly China being  strongly in the market. This is good for Australia in terms of our commodities.  But, we as nation have to do more than rely on commodities for our exports.  We’ve got to more effectively value our,  this is where industry policy and  nation building and trade policy become so critical to our future.    

 JOURNALIST:  And the Iraq situation? How do you think that may affect  things in terms of the dollar on the economy?   

 CREAN:  Well the Iraq situation has already affected the economy  most noticeably through the increased prices of petrol. An increased price of  petrol is producing a huge windfall for the Federal Government - a windfall  through increased profits to the oil companies that translate in to higher  taxation to the Government. A specific increase in the amount obtained from  the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, super profits tax on oil companies and the  third area of course is the increased GST revenues which in the current  transition period for the GST payments all goes to the Commonwealth’s  bottom line.    

 The Commonwealth says it’s powerless to act in relation to the increased  petrol prices - it’s not. It can give the powers to the ACCC to review whether  there is profit taking in the current circumstances. And there’s a huge case to  argue profit taking in Queensland because that 8.5 cent differential is not  being reflected in the prices. So the Commonwealth should be referring the  issue of petrol pricing to the ACCC and the second thing it should be prepared  to do is prepared to freeze oil prices [tax] in the event of war. I say prepared  to, because it’s what Labor did back in 1991 where, off the back of the war,  the argument was that petrol prices had to rise. These are two things that the  Federal Government should be engaging itself in, the fact that it’s not is  another demonstration of its arrogance and the fact that it’s out of touch and  doesn’t understand the real impact on ordinary Australians.     

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think with the high Aussie dollar there is a case for  a shift in the official interest rates?    

 CREAN:  That interest rate question is a matter for the Reserve  Bank to determine and is a matter that next meeting…

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think there is a case for it though?   

 CREAN:  That’s a matter for the Reserve Bank.    

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Crean, there has been a little bit of criticism of your  leadership, mostly on talkback radio this morning - does this worry you or is it  just part of politics?    

 CREAN:  No, there’s a lot of support for it on talkback radio. Look,  the Opposition is one of those difficult jobs in life, probably the hardest in  politics. There are always going to be people who agree with you, disagree  with you, that’s political life. I’m not concerned by it, I’ll be leading the Party  to the next election.
