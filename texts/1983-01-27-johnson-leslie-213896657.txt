 CUTS IN MIGRANT ACCOMMODATION

 The Federal Government has withdrawn subsidised on-arrival 

 migrant centre accommodation from migrants selected under 

 labour shortage programmes Mr Les Johnson MHR for Hughes said  this week. '

 Family reunion migrants and those sponsored under employer 

 nomination schemes are also ineligible for a period of  residence in migrant hostels which in future will mainly cater  for refugees.

 The Minister for Immigration has told Mr Johnson that the  present economic climate is responsible for the cuts in  migrant accommodation.

 Mr Johnson claimed that the reduced accommodation program 

 will trigger off large-scale retrenchments of hostel staff  throughout Australia and the closure of some hostels which  had been in operation for many years.

 "Subsidised accommodation will now be restricted to hard-core  welfare cases and refugees requiring on-arrival English and 

 orientation classes".
