 Speech 

 ADDRESS BY 

 HIS EXCELLENCY MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC 

 GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 

 ON THE OCCASION OF 

 ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL COMMONWEALTH SOCIETY (ACT BRANCH) DINNER 

 GREAT HALL, UNIVERSITY HOUSE, ANU, CANBERRA 

 12 MARCH 2007 

 

 â¢ Mr Hugh Craft, President, Royal Commonwealth Society, ACT Branch, and Mrs Lynne Craft  

 â¢ Your Excellencies the High Commissioners and Ambassadors  

 â¢ Distinguished guests all  

 

 Thank you for your warm welcome to Marlena and me this evening. It is a great pleasure to be here for the 

 Commonwealth Day dinner with members of the Royal Commonwealth Society and kindred societies - to be 

 amongst old friends.  

 

 Where, in a national and international sense, the expression of practical friendship and the sharing of skills 

 and ideas still count for something - where neighbours help neighbours - where struggling countries are 

 given the means (be it through individual citizens, local communities or other national governments) to 

 elevate themselves.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen. In her Silver Jubilee speech in 1977, The Queen made the relevant point that the 

 Commonwealth symbolises “the transformation of the crown from an emblem of dominion into a symbol of 

 free and voluntary association. In all history this has no precedent”.  

 

 To quote the Commonwealth’s own literature, the association is “a large slice of this world of ours. We are 53 

 nations and 1.8 billion people. We are African, Asian, Caribbean, European and Pacific. Home to the richest 

 and poorest and those of every colour and creed - an association of equals sharing the fundamental beliefs of 

 democracy and freedom. We celebrate diversity, respect difference and promote understanding - between 

 faiths, ethnic groups and communities - at every level: local, regional, national and international.”  

 

 The Statute of Westminster that began the then British Commonwealth of Nations in 1931 coincided with the 

 fading days of European empire during which some former colonies were treading the path to independence. 

 Indeed the Statute of Westminster gave legal status to the independence of Australia, Canada, the Irish Free 

 State, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South Africa. After the Second World War, India gained 

 independence, the new state of Pakistan was simultaneously created, and a global wave of decolonisation

 followed which saw several other former colonies become independent and sovereign states.  

 

 As the Commonwealth notes: “The London Declaration of 1949 was a milestone on the road to developing 

 the modern Commonwealth. India provided an interesting test case: it desired to become a republic yet 

 wanted to remain a member of the Commonwealth and this posed a fresh challenge to the entire concept. 

 Would Commonwealth membership only be for countries "owing an allegiance to the Crown" as the Balfour 

 Report had stated? A conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1949 decided to revise this criterion 

 and to accept and recognise India's continued membership as a republic, paving the way for other newly 

 independent countries to join. At the same time, the word 'British' was dropped from the association's title to 

 reflect the Commonwealth's changing character.”  

 

 That flexibility has been one of the keys to the Commonwealth’s success.  

 

 The Commonwealth is unique. It has no army; it has no constitution (its structure is based largely on 

 unwritten and traditional procedures); it had an imperial past yet is unhindered as a modern catalyst for 

 global consensus-building; it is not a political union of states, and its members enjoy equal status regardless 

 of size or wealth (from India with a population in excess of one billion to Tuvalu with just over 11,000 

 people). It employs English as the lingua franca and joy of joys, many of its members play cricket!  

 

 There is truth in the old saying that “the shifts of fortune test the reliability of friends.” The Commonwealth’s 

 flexibility has ensured its bonds have survived and indeed prospered despite the challenges and 

 understandable differences of opinion and approach over the years - through the difficult years for countries 

 such as the then Rhodesia. (We remember the 1966 CHOGM in Lagos, convened to discuss action against the 

 minority regime which had unilaterally declared independence in Southern Rhodesia, set up a committee to 

 review UN sanctions against Rhodesia, and launched a training program for Rhodesian Africans). And for 

 South Africa. (We recall the 1985 CHOGM in Nassau when the Commonwealth Accord demanded the 

 dismantling of apartheid and agreed a range of measures to put pressure on the Pretoria regime).  

 

 The Commonwealth’s own transformation has naturally enough not been without growing pains, but its goals 

 are noble and worthwhile. Its capacity extends to fostering international peace and security, democracy, 

 liberty of the individual and equal rights for all, through its focus on eradicating poverty, ignorance and 

 disease and its opposition to all forms of racial discrimination.  

 

 Those promises of the Commonwealth are in large part reality. The greatness of the Commonwealth is not 

 expressed in the number of countries it represents, its budget, the muted elegance of its secretariat building 

 in London, nor necessarily the association’s history. Its reputation and weight of influence is represented by 

 the scale and scope of its programs that touch individual lives; for example:  

 

 â¢ Developing and instituting programs to review and update clinical guidelines for HIV/AIDS sufferers in 

 Africa and elsewhere, and instituting the Young Ambassador for Positive Living program that encourages 

 young people infected with or affected by HIV and AIDS to educate their peers on the dangers of the disease; 

 

 â¢ Instituting enterprise schemes and training courses for young women and men to help them develop a skill 

 or vocation in developing countries where the majority of young people (aged 15 to 24) work in menial tasks 

 and otherwise have little chance of earning a decent living and breaking out of the poverty cycle;  

 â¢ Spearheading good governance at senior levels within public sector agencies in Bangladesh;  

 â¢ Training Mauritian prosecutors and others investigating money-laundering;  

 â¢ Developing effective financial management practices in Papua New Guinea;  

 â¢ Training the trainers on poverty alleviation in Nigeria;  

 â¢ Instituting management programmes for metropolitan local government services, and developing small 

 business and entrepreneurship in India; and  

 â¢ Running training sessions in conflict management in Zanzibar, Tanzania.  

 

 I have first hand experience working for the Commonwealth. In 2000 it was my privilege to help review the 

 PNG Defence Force and to co-author The Commonwealth Eminent Persons Report on ways and means to 

 Page 2 of 4 Governor General of Australia ~ Speeches

 create a more cost-effective and operationally oriented force.  

 

 I mention this mix of programs, which incidentally merely scratch the surface, not to labour the complexity of 

 global problems but to point optimistically to the organisation’s effectiveness. The Commonwealth builds on 

 its sense of purpose by reaching out to others, no matter how difficult the circumstances, how seemingly 

 insurmountable or long-term the challenges.  

 

 Building happy and fulfilling lives, promoting good governance and sustainable nationhood is akin to building 

 a web. One little strand at a time may seem insignificant but there is an old Ethiopian proverb that states, 

 "when spider webs unite they can tie up a lion".  

 

 We know that many threads have fashioned the web of Commonwealth life and that of its member nations 

 but there is still far more to be done.  

 

 There are still countries within the Commonwealth family that face the spectre of HIV and AIDs-related 

 illness, particularly some of our friends in the Pacific and Africa. There are still institutional or governance 

 failures and law and order problems which in turn lead to war, poverty, refugee crisis and infrastructure 

 breakdown. There are still issues within some of our Commonwealth family of water and food shortages, and 

 of education deficiencies.  

 

 What is the solution? In simple terms, there must be a recognition that the problem exists.  

 And there must be a desire to fix the problem.  

 

 This is not always easy, but where countries express a desire for help, then the rest of the Commonwealth 

 should respond as best it can in a generous, coordinated and sustained way.  

 

 In Australia, I strongly suggest to newly accredited High Commissioners that they visit our research 

 institutions, and our educational, agricultural and health facilities to see for themselves how and where we 

 might be able to work more productively together.  

 

 I am always encouraged by the exchange of students between nations as was so significantly fostered by the 

 Colombo Plan, which is still remembered with affection by the participating countries of Australia, Canada, Sri 

 Lanka (or Ceylon as it was then), India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom; who were later 

 joined by Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, the Philippines, the United States, Thailand and Malaya; 

 and eventually by the enlarged Federation of Malaysia and Singapore.  

 

 The spirit of that plan continues with the broadened Australian scholarship program, and indeed, I am 

 pleased to see the increasing opportunities for exchange between public servants, teachers and other 

 professionals between nations.  

 

 I am sure you would all agree that Commonwealth Day should be a day of genuine celebration and reflection. 

 And within this context let me congratulate the ACT Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society for its role in 

 helping raise the profile of the Commonwealth and the high values for which it stands.  

 

 I commend Hugh Craft and his executive for reinvigorating the RCS in the ACT, for deliberating on and 

 devising new ways to encourage interest in the work of the Commonwealth especially through programs 

 targeting younger members of the community.  

 

 May I also congratulate you on today's multi faith celebration of the Commonwealth - a recent initiative for 

 Canberra, following a pattern established in London and other Commonwealth capitals. It emphasises the 

 importance of the Commonwealth's spiritual diversity and its role in bringing together individuals and 

 societies with different creeds and ethnicities.  

 

 Indeed, such a celebration resonates with the theme of The Queen’s Commonwealth Day message this year - 

 respecting difference, promoting understanding. These are powerful sentiments, and I congratulate members 

 Page 3 of 4 Governor General of Australia ~ Speeches

 of the RCS for holding true to proven values whilst at the same time looking at new ways to view the world 

 and how we best interact with it. In so doing I am sure you will encourage others to take a life-long interest 

 in the work of the Commonwealth.  

 

 And thus I return to the very heart of the Commonwealth ideal. The word “commonwealth” derived from the 

 ancient Latin meaning “serving together”. Such a notion transcends individual interest - a not insignificant 

 challenge in itself. But as The Queen rightly noted ten years ago at CHOGM in Edinburgh: “the real soul of the 

 Commonwealth, the motor, the drive, call it what you will, is provided by people within and without those 

 governments. It is people who run the non-governmental organisations, who give a helping hand to the sick 

 or unemployed…..it is people who elect their governments and exercise, by the discipline of the ballot box, 

 their right to choose how they are governed. The more the activities of the Commonwealth bring direct 

 benefits to its people, the stronger the organisation will be.”  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen. Congratulations on commemorating Commonwealth Day with this happy and 

 enjoyable event. I wish the Royal Commonwealth Society in the ACT every success for the future and my 

 hope is that many more young Australians will be encouraged to consider the role they can play in promoting 

 the Commonwealth. Indeed we need the presence, energy and insight of young people to provide the very 

 flexibility of approach that enabled the Commonwealth, from it early days, to prove itself. I wish you all well 

 for the future.  

 

 Thank you.
