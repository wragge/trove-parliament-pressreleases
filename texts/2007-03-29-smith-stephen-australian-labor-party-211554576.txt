 RETIREMENT FROM THE PARLIAMENT OF   DR CARMEN LAWRENCE    

 My very best wishes go to Carmen Lawrence following her decision to retire from public  life after more than 20 years of State and Federal Parliamentary and Ministerial service.   

 Carmen’s retirement will be a great loss to the Parliament, the Australian Labor Party and  the people of Fremantle.   

 Carmen is a long standing friend and colleague, an association which began with her first  campaign for election to Parliament, her 1986 campaign for the Western Australian State  seat of Subiaco.   

 In 1990, Carmen made history, the first woman to become a Premier and Australia’s first  woman Treasurer. As the then Western Australian ALP State Secretary, I was pleased to  be able to work closely with her as Premier and Treasurer of Western Australia.   

 Carmen entered Federal Parliament in 1994 and served with distinction as Minister for  Human Services and Health.    

 Carmen became the Party’s first popularly elected National President in 2004.   

 Carmen has always been motivated by good public policy. She has been a tireless  advocate for social justice and an active campaigner for refugee and asylum seekers.    

 Carmen has made a substantial contribution to public life.   

 I wish her all the best for her future contribution to thoughtful public policy at the  University of Western Australia.
