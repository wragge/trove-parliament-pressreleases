  ASSISTANCE FOR REFUGEES ON THAI-BURMA BORDER

  I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will continue 
to provide humanitarian assistance to Australian non-g overnment 
organisations to assist Burmese refugees living in camps along the border 
between Thailand and Burma. Funds will be provided through AusAID’s 
humanitarian relief program

 The Australian Government 
is aware of the strain placed on Thai Government resources due to the 
presence of the large numbers of Burmese refugees in their country and 
is prepared to assist where necessary to help alleviate the situation. 

 It is encouraging to 
note the continued assistance the Thai Government provides to these 
unfortunate people caught up in the internal conflict back in their 
homeland. We encourage Thailand to continue this assistance until a 
solution can be found in resulting in their safe return to Burma. 

 We also encourage the 
Burmese Government to improve human rights issues in their country, 
which is the underlying cause of the outpouring of so many people seeking 
the sanctuary of these camps.

 The Australian Government 
funding will provide assistance to some 110,000 refugees composed largely 
of Karen ethnic minority but also the Mon and Karenni peoples. The funds 
will be disbursed as follows.

 Medecins Sans Frontieres 
will receive $900,000 over three years to improve the health status 
of refugees by controlling communicable diseases and improving sanitation 
conditions in the camps. Activities will include a malaria control program, 
training and supervision of local medics and nurses, public health education 
and an expanded program of immunisation.

 The National Council 
of Churches in Australia will receive up to $3 million over three years 
for its project to provide food and basic commodities such as blankets 
and mosquito nets to people living in the refugee camps. 

 Australia has provided 
over $5 million in the past five years through the aid program towards 
assisting people living the refugee camps.
