 Abstract: This paper will characterise the major economic dimensions of Australian 

 research  into  economic  aspects  of  immigration.  This  will  cover  macro-economics  

 (labour  markets,  current  account,  government  budgets),  long-run  growth  

 (productivity, real income) and social economics (distribution of income and wealth, 

 discrimination) and discuss the major gaps remaining for informing Australian policy 

 (ageing,  environment,  regional  distribution).  It  will  speculate  on  the  likely influence  

 of research on future policy and may even bravely speculate on lessons from Australia 

 for Europe and vice versa  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 I  Introduction 

 

  Since the Second World War migrants or the children of migrants have provided 50 per cent of 

 population  increase  and  almost  60  per  cent  of  work  force  growth.   As  at  2001,  23  per  cent  of  the  

 population  were  overseas  born,  one  of  the  highest  shares  for  any  country.   Migrant  labour  directly  

 increased Australia’s post-war GDP growth rate by 42 per cent (Withers 1999).  In this sense, modern 

 Australia is a product of immigration. 

 

  In  the  Australian  pragmatic  tradition  there  has  been  much  focus  in  public  discussion  and  in  

 research  on  the  linkages  between  immigration  and  the  economy.  In  public  debate  over  immigration,  

 economic  issues  are  often  a  central  element.  On  the  one  hand  many  supporters  of  substantial  

 immigration base their position on its perceived role in Australian development and prosperity. On the 

 other  hand  many  opponents  of  high  immigration  take  that  position  because  of  their  concern  that  

 immigration  is  a  source  of  national  economic  problems.  In  scholarly  discussion,  the  economics  of  

 immigration  has  been  a  distinctive  concern  of  Australian  economists,  as  with  like  areas  such  as  

 agricultural economics and international trade. For Australian economics the interdependence between 

 resources, people and cross-border movements has been an abiding themei. 

 

  In  the  early  post-war  period,  major  names  in  Australian  economics  such  as  Karmel,  Corden,  

 Bensusan-Butt, Kmenta and  Arndt found  immigration a topic worthy of their close attention.  In more 

 recent  times  economists  such  as  Norman,  Lloyd,  Chapman,  Nevile,  Pope,  Cobb-Clark,  Junankar,  

 Creedy, McDonald and others have been ongoing contributors. A recent trend has been for economic 

 consultancies  such  as  Econtech,  Access  Economics  and  the  Centre  for  International  Economics  to  

 provide  valuable  commissioned  studies  in  the  field.  However  a  brief  flurry  of  high  quality  official  

 research work in the 1990s under the aegis of the Bureau of Immigration, Population and Multicultural 

 Research stopped when that organization was abolished in 1996ii.  

 

  The early post-war focus was upon the short-run macro-economic impacts of immigration, and 

 analysis in this vein has continued ever sinceiii. For the short-term issues the basic economic concerns 

 have  been  the  implications  of  immigration  for  unemployment,  training,  wages  and  inflation,  public  

 outlays and the balance of payments, wage and income distribution This paper reviews the literature on 

 these issues and argues for a substantial professional convergence today on their nature and outcomes. 

 However it is argued that the same convergence does not apply for a range of issues that go beyond the 

 short-run  macro-economics  tradition  that  has  dominated  Australian  research.  In  other  areas  a  more  

 contested professional terrain is still found-including in long-run income growth, demographic ageing, 

 regional impact and the environment. 

 II. The macro-economics of immigration. 

 

  In relation to  the short-term economic issues for immigration,  considerable policy concern has 

 been evinced from time to time regarding perceived adverse consequences of migration. In almost each 

 case  research  however  has  consistently  shown  a  basically  neutral  outcome  of  immigration  for  the  

 economy. This is not to say precisely neutral. Nor is it to say that a different outcome might not have 

 occurred under different conditionsiv. But the key point emerging from the economic research in these 

 areas  is  to  recognise  that  immigration  has  impacts  on  both  the  supply  and  demand  sides  of  the  

 economy, thus producing offsetting effects (Foster 1994). 

 

  Much of the popular public debate recognises only one side or the other for these impacts. Often 

 this is understandable, since the offsetting effects may be subtle, indirect or complex. But this is not to 

 say  they  are  not  equally  important.  The  precise  balance  of  effects  is  a  matter  for  empirical  

 investigation, the results to date of which are now discussed for the major short-term impacts of labour-market outcomes, current account deficits, and public outlays and revenue, respectivelyv. 

 

 Labour market outcomes. 

  Particular concern often arises over the labour market effects of immigration. A popular view is 

 that immigration only adds to  the number of workers and  so  increases the level of unemployment or, 

 more specifically, that newly arrived migrants take jobs from existing residents.  

 

  Such a view is understandable. It does seem obvious that there is competition for jobs and that 

 migrants  may  displace  other  residents.  But  this  view  misses  the  demand  created  by  migration,  for  

 immigration can boost spending on goods and services which, in turn, increases demand for the labour 

 to  produce  those  goods  and  services.  This  is  to  say  migrants  are  not  only  workers  but  are  also  

 consumers, a point stressed in the Australian literature as early as Karmel (1953). Moreover many also 

 bring capital funds with them and  they may induce others to  spend  eg domestic and  foreign business 

 investment to meet the greater consumer demand  (Arndt 1964, Lloyd 1982, Lloyd 1996).  

 

  This issue has been examined in a wide range of studies in Australia over different time periods 

 and  using  different  methodologies  such  as  time-series  analysis,  structural  modeling,  and  simulation,  

 and  beginning with Harrison (1984), Pope and Withers (1985, 1993), through Ackland and Williams 

 (1992),  to  Shan  and  Sun  (1998)  and  Addison  and  Worswick  (2002).   The  burden  of evidence  is  that  

 immigration has not caused any net increase in the unemployment rate in Australia.  

 

  This finding is in no way incompatible with the observed fact of higher average unemployment 

 rates for recently arrived migrants. Settlement adjustment can take time and in the interim, expenditure 

 effects  may  disproportionately  benefit  the  employment  prospects  of  existing  residents.  Chapman  and  

 Cobb-Clark (1999) show a significant benefit to local unemployed where immigration is accompanied 

 by  capital  transfer.  The  conclusion  is  also  consistent  with  an  impact  that  can  vary  across  industries,  

 occupations  and  regions  (Brooks  and  Williams  1995).  Moreover  some  migrant  groups  themselves  

 experience  very  low  unemployment  and  others  can  have  quite  high  rates.  For  instance,  it  is  not  

 surprising that many refugees whose education and work have suffered massive dislocation as a result 

 of their experiences, may have higher than average unemployment. 

 

  In  contrast  to  public  concern  over  perceived  adverse  unemployment  consequences  of  

 immigration, a long-standing concern of the union movement has been instead the potential impact of 

 immigration on training opportunities for existing workers. If immigration is used by employers to fill 

 shortages of skilled workers, the fear is that this provides an incentive to avoid proper training of local 

 employees.  Of  course,  recruiting  migrant  workers  is  not  cost-less.  It  is  subject  to  problems  of  lags  

 before they arrive, problems of compatibility of qualifications, and problems of firm retention. Migrant 

 workers  are  also  subject  to  the  same  minimum  requirements  for  conditions  of  employment  as  for  

 existing residents. Nevertheless employers do seek skilled migrants and the remaining issue is whether 

 the numbers arriving displace local skill formation. 

 

  The answer, as with unemployment, is a matter of the balance between offsetting effects. In the 

 case  of  training,  as  with  jobs,  migrant-created  demand  itself  induces  a  need  for  new  training  slots  

 wherever that demand is sourced. And while there could be particular imbalances from time to time in 

 the process, the available research evidence (particularly Wooden 1990 and Baker and Wooden 1991) 

 finds at least an overall match of extra skill supplied and extra training induced or possibly a small net 

 gain (Stromback et al 1993). 

 

  Finally,  in  terms  of   labour  market  effects,  it  is  possible  that  unemployment  effects  of  

 immigration would be muted if adjustment in the labour market took place via changes in wages. Then 

 imbalance between supply and demand effects would not be observed in unemployment, but rather in 

 wage movements. Local workers would suffer from reduced wages, rather than from unemployment. 

 

  This is less likely to be the outcome for Australia however, as the Australian labour market has 

 been one of the most highly regulated amongst industrial countries. The extensive system of minimum 

 wages  in  place  since  early  in  the  twentieth  century  has  meant  limited  capacity  for  wage  reduction.  

 Nevertheless it is possible that wage-setting authorities may have themselves responded endogenously 

 to the presence of migration in fixing wages and, in recent years, the wages system has itself become 

 increasingly  deregulated.  Or,  again,  the  immigration  could  have  induced  inflation,  so  reducing  real  

 wages  if  not  nominal  wages.  Empirical  research,  however,  has  found  that  there  is  no  linkage  from  

 immigration to nominal wages (Norman 1985), nor to price inflation (eg Junankar and Pope 1990), thus 

 confirming  again  a  broad  balance  between  aggregate  demand  and  supply  effects  on  the  macro-economy. 

 Current account deficits 

  With  broad  macro-balance  being  a  consistent  finding  of  labour  market  studies  in  relation  to  

 immigration,  it  would  be  surprising  if  a  different  result  held  for  the  balance  of  payments  on  current  

 account. 

 

  Nevertheless this could be possible. The demand created by migrants could well be “bunched” 

 so  producing  foreign  borrowing  requirements  for  that  period  (Argy  1990,  Mitchell  1996),  or,  if  

 migrants bring in fairly large sums of lifetime accumulated funds when they arrive in Australia, there 

 could be improvements on the current account, offset later by the prospect of remittances. Some have 

 suggested migrants are irrelevant to much of Australia’s exports (eg agricultural and mineral products), 

 but  may  be  major  importers,  including  of  products  from  their  source  countries.  Or  will  there  be  a  

 foreign exchange benefit from visits from friends and relatives? 

 

  Clearly  there  are  a  myriad  of  transmission  mechanisms  for  an  effect  on  the  current  account  -  

 and there are further downstream induced effects. In addition while it is likely that any one cohort may 

 have  a  definable  sequence  of  impact  eg  early  borrowing  and   subsequent  saving,  overlapping  cohort  

 effects must also be taken into account. The only effective resolution of the issue can be empirical. And 

 again  the  available  evidence  in  this  respect  is  that  migrant  arrivals  are  neutral  with  respect  to  the  

 current  account  balance  (Junankar,  Pope  and  Kapuscinski  1994),  though  an  emigration  ‘brain  drain’  

 may  have  had  a  significant  negative  effect  on  the  current  account.  Certainly  the  composition  of  

 departures  is  even  more  skewed  to  skilled  persons  than  is  arrivals.  Within  arrivals,  there  are  studies  

 showing  high  export  pay-offs  to  particular  migration  categories  eg  business  migrants  (Access  

 Economics 1998), but overall there has been a basically neutral average impact. 

 

  Very  major  changes  in  migrant  entry  composition  could  shift  outcomes  somewhat.  But  the  

 migration  program  itself  represents  an  ongoing  political  balancing  of  competing  humanitarian,  

 economic and social objectives such that complete dominance by any one type of migration is unlikely 

 for Australia - and hence so is dramatic change in impact. By contrast, there are US studies (eg Borjas 

 1999)  showing  that  the  lower  skill  composition  of  US  immigration  has  had  more  negative  net  

 consequences  there  for  some  workers  (especially  in  local  low-skill  labour  markets)  than  has  been  

 discernable for Australia (and for Canada). 

 

 Public outlays and revenue  

  As with labour markets and the current account, the effect of immigrants on the public purse is a 

 matter of balance between demand and supply-side effects.  

 

  In the popular debate over immigration and the public purse, criticism of immigration focuses 

 on  the  demand  generated  though  migration  for  government  spending  on  welfare  services,  education  

 and  health  and  wider  infrastructure  eg  roads,  water.  But  there  is  equally  a  need  to  examine  the  less  

 evident supply effects for public revenue through income tax, indirect tax, user charges and the like. 

  There  has  been  some  debate  over  migrant-specific  services  where,  in  the  early  stages  of  

 settlement,  it  is  likely  that  outlays  do  exceed  revenue  eg  language  classes  (Rimmer  1988).  Also  it  is  

 likely  that  for  a  specific  intake  there  is  a  period  where  migrant-induced  public  expenditure  exceeds  

 revenue  generated  for  a  time,  but  thereafter  moderates.  It  equally  needs  to  be  recognised  that,  with  

 adult migrants, expenditure on education, training and health costs prior to arrival have been incurred 

 elsewhere, a major saving for the Australian taxpayer (Lander 1988), just as is receipt of pension for 

 retirees  who  relocate  to  Australia  on  overseas  pensions.  Conversely  those  who  retire  overseas  on  

 Australian pensions constitute a budget cost (Whiteford 1991).  

 

  The net impact of the many considerations such as these will vary with the type of migrant, the 

 type of expenditure or revenue and the level of government. It will also vary over time as the nature of 

 public sector activity alters eg greater requirements for self-funding in retirement for income support, 

 health care and aged care services. For the particularly politically sensitive area of social security, the 

 finding is that despite extensive benefit reliance for some migrant sub-groups (eg refugees), there is no 

 overall disproportionate demand for social welfare support ahead of tax contributions (Whiteford 1991, 

 Hellwig  et  al  1992).   And  indeed  adding  up  all  outlays  and  revenues,  the  burden  of  the  empirical  

 evidence indicates that there has been a significantly positive contribution of immigration to the public 

 purse  in  Australia  eg  Centre  for  International  Economics  (1992),  Cutts  (1992),  Mathews  (1992),  

 Access Economics (2002). 

 

  A particular policy issue of interest in this context is the position of illegal migrants. Given their 

 restricted  take-up  of  social  support,  it  is  possible  that  illegals  make  a  larger  net  contribution  to  the  

 public purse than legal migrants (Lukomskyj and Borowski 1991). However no case for their toleration 

 on  these  grounds  has  been  made.  The  spillover  cost  to  society  of  toleration  of  illegality  is  no  doubt  

 instinctively seen as too great. The public opinion reaction to the Tampa asylum seeker issue in 2001 

 would  seem to  strongly affirm this  view.  The  notion of “queue-jumping”  gained  some  prominence  in 

 public debate over the issue. 

 

 Wage and Income Distribution 

  In  interpreting  the  macro-economic  impacts,  some  related  social  economics  dimensions  have  

 also  been  important.  One  proposition  emerging  from  some  past  studies  has  been  that  migrants  might  

 benefit  more  than  natives  in  the  migration  process  eg  Parmenter  (1990),  Parmenter  and  Peter  (1991)  

 and  Peter  and  Verekios  (1996).  This  conclusion  arises  because  the  models  used  in  such  analysis  

 emphasize how extra workers will either bid  down wages or  they will create unemployment if wages 

 are inflexible.  

 

  However  the  results  can  in  fact  be  otherwise  once  two   factors  are  allowed  for  viz.  offsetting  

 positive  dynamic  benefits  and  the  ownership  of  capital  by existing  residents.  In  the  latter  case,  if  the  

 return to labour did decrease with immigration, the return to capital will increase. This capital is largely 

 owned by residents. And when housing stock is acknowledged as part of capital and when ownership 

 of shares is widespread (eg through compulsory superannuation), then capital return benefit can also be 

 quite widespread. 

 

  Even for labour earnings, when Addison and Worswick (2002) use regression to analyse cross-sections from the official income distribution survey for the years 1982 through 1996, no detrimental 

 effect  of  immigrants  on  native  earnings  are  detected.  Nor  is  this  altered  when  the  specific  impact  on  

 less-educated  or  younger  Australian  workers  is  investigated.   This  reinforces  earlier  compositional  

 findings  such  as  those  by  Saunders  and  King  (1994).  Addison  and  Worswick  (p.77)  conclude  that  

 “these results add to a growing body of literature that has consistently failed to find  that immigration 

 adversely affects the earnings of native-born Australians” 

 

 III. Contested Terrain 

 

  The  preceding  section  established  that  overall  the  macro-economic  effects  of  immigration  to  

 Australia  have  been  neutral  or  benign.  This  was  not  always  the  view  and  for  some  decades  these  

 matters were contested professional terrain.   However in these particular matters the accumulation of 

 economic  knowledge  has served  policy well.  Refinement  of theory and  conduct  of ongoing empirical  

 research,  often  using  competing  theories  and  alternate  empirical  methods  and  data,  have  produced  

 increasingly  consistent  and  robust  conclusions.  The  results  are,  however,  not  always  obvious  or  self-evident   and  they  are  highly  dependent  on  offsetting  and  subtle  indirect  effects,  which  makes  the  

 subsequent  task  of  policy  persuasion  still  somewhat  difficult.  Hence  their  full  benefit  has  yet  to  be  

 realised in the practical domain of policy. 

 

  A  bigger  problem  professionally  today,  however,  is  that  a  number  of  other  issues  central  to  

 immigration  policy  do  still  remain  professionally  contested  or  under-developed.  These  include  the  

 issues  of  real  income  growth,  population  ageing,  population  distribution  and  green  house  emissions.  

 These are core issues for policy since the more immigration is understood to assist real income growth 

 and mute population ageing concerns it will be enhanced, the more it is seen as being maldistributed 

 and causing environmental problems the more it will be opposed. The remainder of this paper looks at 

 recent professional and policy contributions in these areas. 

 

  Real IncomeGrowth 

  An  older  view  was  that  the  law  of  diminishing  returns  meant  that  adding  population  to  fixed  

 capital reduced marginal product and hence real wages. A more modern variant of this approach to real 

 income issues has been the work of Guest and McDonald (2002). It has pursued and obtained extensive 

 press  reporting  and  so  deserves  close  scrutiny.  Essentially  Guest  and  McDonald  also  argue  that  low  

 fertility and low migration may actually enhance adult consumption per head, so that there is no need 

 for concern over population slowdown. Their logic is that there is a lower investment requirement and 

 associated savings with fewer children. Further, with fewer workers down the track with lower fertility 

 and  low immigration,  there  will  be  a  lower  investment  requirement  to  sustain  the  capital-labour  ratio  

 for  the  domestic  labour  force  (a  “Solow  effect”  or  “investment  dividend”).  “Smoothing”  allows  the  

 dividends  to  be  used  to  finance  an  optimum  inter-temporal  consumption  path.  To  demonstrate  this  a  

 simulation model is used. 

 

  But the model that simulates this process assumes the following, inter alia: 

 

 â¢ constant returns to scale 

 â¢ exogenous technology  

 â¢ homogeneous capital 

 â¢ constant unit cost for (age-adjusted) social outlays 

 â¢ easy substitution of capital for labour 

 â¢ constant (age-adjusted) labour force participation rates. 

 

 

  The  first  five  of  these  features  causes  the  model  to  under-estimate  the  economic  benefit  for  

 consumption  of  higher  fertility,  while  the  sixth  causes  the  model  to  under-estimate  the  economic  

 benefit for consumption of lower fertility. Addressing each in turn: 

 

 (a)  The  analysis  provides  no  empirical  justification  for  the  constant  returns  to  scale  assumption,  

 however analytically convenient. Certainly much business literature refers to the need for scale 

 or,  more  convincing  to  economists,  the  industry  economics  literature   provides  guidance.  For  

 instance,  Antweiler  and  Trefler  (2002)  have  found  one-third  of  global  trade  to  be  subject  to  

 increasing  returns,  and  Keller  (2002)  shows  how  distance  for  countries  such  as  Australia  

 reduces  international  technology  diffusion  from  the  industrial  population  centers  originating  

 most new technology. 

 (b) Exogenous technology  seems quite inconsistent with the direction of modern endogenous growth 

 theory which emphasises the contrary. More production induces more innovation. For instance, 

 the new growth theory models of Romer, Grossman, Helpmann, Aghion etc have been applied 

 by Jones (2002) to measure how long-run growth arises from discovery of ideas which depend 

 upon  population  growth.  For  Australia  itself,  Nevile  (1990)  calculated  that  a  one  per  cent  

 increase in total output  increased the rate of innovation by 0.6 per cent. 

 (c)  In  relation  to  homogeneous  capital,  Australian  economists  more  than  most  have  known  since  

 Salter that capital comes in vintages. Concern for the “Solow effect” therefore carries with it the 

 danger of ignoring the “Salter Effect” and the associated problem of relying on an ageing capital 

 stock  embodying  increasingly  outdated  technology  and  hence  of  having  declining  total  factor  

 productivity (as conventionally measured). The same applies to human capital. If the response is 

 to  keep  the  latter  up-to-date  via  life-long  learning  then  this  reduces  the  consumption  dividend  

 otherwise claimed.   

 (d)  A  constant  unit  cost  for  (age  -adjusted)  social  outlays  seems  most  improbable.  Baumol’s  

 unbalanced growth model would indicate costs for aged care rising much faster than is the fixed 

 trend  productivity growth assumed,  which latter so  much helps the Panglossian conclusions of 

 the model. Reinforcing the artificiality of this assumption of constancy in unit social cost is the 

 whole  trend  of  health  care  technology  to  increase  costs  too.  These  are  pressures  to  increase  

 costs.  If  these  pressures  further  render  benefits  endogenous  and  reduce  them  accordingly,  this  

 may save on outlays-but expose an underlying intergenerational conflict that could be anything 

 other than benign. 

 (e)  There  are  important  limits  to  capital-labour  substitutability,  including  especially  in  labour-intensive  service  activities  often  of  the  essence  in  relation  to  an  ageing  population.  Such  a  

 population needs home maintenance, personal care and health care services etc for which some 

 increasing capital substitution may be found, but with substantial growing direct personal labour 

 requirements still likely from a diminishing workforce 

 (f) Labour-force participation is likely to be endogenous with respect to fertility. As child-rearing falls 

 off  with  lower  fertility,  adult  female  labour  market  participation  should  rise  (or  leisure  

 consumption).  This  reinforces  the  net  consumption  benefit  (after  due  deduction  of  the  loss  of  

 consumption benefit from the pleasure in raising children). 

 

  A final point is to stress the limitations to simulation analysis in providing definitive answers on 

 these matters. Such analysis is best at providing indicative or suggestive answers. But direct estimation 

 methods may be more able to balance the range of factors, including the effects of difficult to measure 

 effects  such  as  scale  economies  and  even  broader  effects  through  endogeneity  and  spillovers  and  

 synergies  eg  productive  diversity  and  entrepreneurship  effects.  The  several  Australian  attempts  to  

 provide such direct estimation based  on historical data find  strong positive links from immigration to  

 productivity and per capita income growth eg Nevile(1990), Withers (1988), Pope and Withers (1995). 

 This is direct evident which directly contradicts Guest and McDonald’s simulation. Caution is therefore 

 required before acceding  to the blandishments of the Guest-McDonald extinction economics.  

 

 Population Ageing 

  A  related  matter  is  the  issue  of  population  ageing  and  immigration.  There  was  another  

 somewhat  Panglossian  view evident  amongst  many economists  in  a  major  conference  on  these  issues  

 convened by the Productivity Commission (1999). The dominant view was that Australia has far lower 

 shares of elderly than other OECD countries, it had put in place the appropriate policies to deal with the 

 ageing that would occur, immigration did not help slow ageing anyway and besides it is good that we 

 have greater longevity, particularly since in most cases it is accompanied by a healthy and rewarding 

 lifestyle.  

 

  It is helpful to look at these propositions. Yes, Australia is in the fortunate position of having a 

 younger age profile than many OECD countries and of having moved in the direction of reducing the 

 public  transfers  required  by  an  ageing  population  through  compulsory savings  policies  and  increased  

 incentives  for  private  health  insurance.  But  it  remains  true  that  substantial  demographic  ageing  will  

 occur  for  Australia  over  the  decades  ahead  and  that  the  self-provision  arrangements  are  incomplete.  

 More  is  needed  to  prevent  a  bigger  intergenerational  transfer  burden  from  bedeviling  our  political  

 future. This will require a range of measures including higher savings, greater control of health costs, 

 greater aged workforce participation and higher selective immigration. 

 

  The Inter Generational Report (Treasury 2002) that accompanied the 2002-2003 Budget was an 

 important  correction  to  the  preceding  orthodoxy  among  economists  on  analysis  of  these  issues.  That  

 report  documents  a  significant  role  for  immigration  in  population  ageing  despite  the  contrary  public  

 statements of Finance Minister Minchin who, in this matter, seems to have not read thoroughly his own 

 Government’s budget papers when he said: "The report rules out an increase in immigration as a way 

 to water down the problem" (ABC News, May 15,2002). The Inter Generational Report concluded that 

 population ageing under present trends would require an increase in the public outlays share of GDP of 

 5% by 2042. It also found that an increase in net migration from a base case of 90,000 to a higher level 

 of 135,000 would raise GDP by 10% and real per capita income by 2% by 2042, and reduce the aged 

 population  share  by  six  percentage  points.  This  latter  could  represent  some  $30billion  in  reduced  

 outlays,  a  worthy  target  for  a  Finance  Minister-and  for  it  to  be  achieved  via  enhanced  immigration  

 might also have been thought to be potentially attractive to a South Australian Senator. 

 

  Indeed the estimates in the Inter Generational Report are, if anything, conservative. They ignore 

 the scale and induced innovation effects already discussed and further productive diversity effects (see 

 Goff  et  al  2002  for  fascinating  evidence  on  the  latter).Also  they  adopt  a  demographic  projection  

 methodology  based  on  absolute  migration  levels  which  inevitably  shows  a  diminishing  influence  of  

 immigration  over  time.  An  alternative  immigration  rate-based  methodology  supports  an  even  greater  

 estimate of the role of immigration in muting (though not reversing) the impact of demographic ageing 

 (Withers 2002). Of course, the focus of that impact is upon public transfers and the tax base, but there 

 are also issues of the adjustment and innovation capacity of an ageing society. This is not to denigrate 

 the aged nor to decry the benefit of greater longevity. The latter of course is what used to be called a 

 motherhood  statement,  though  no  doubt  that  specific  invocation  is  reducing  pari  passu  with  fertility.  

 The point only is that of population balance - an appropriate mix of the old and the new.  

 

 Regional Distribution and Impacts 

  The new economic geography and environmental and ecological economics do tell us to to pay 

 attention to location and space. So do the contemporary policy realities of debate over immigration in 

 Australia. And economists have offered their insights here too, as this section will discuss. 

 

  But  the  lead  in  this  area  no  doubt  comes  more  from a  political  leader  than  the  economists.  In  

 particular  NSW  Premier  Bob  Carr  has  been  prominent  in  expressing  concern  that  the  costs  of  

 immigration are too high because of their concentration upon Sydney. In  recent speeches to the Davos 

 Leadership Forum and the Urban Development Institute of Australia (Carr 2002a,b), Mr Carr has given 

 nine reasons for his view that expansive immigration is unwarranted. He termed these points a “mental 

 picture”  that  conveyed  the  need  for  caution  on  immigration.  In  particular  he  cautioned  against  

 population targets like 50 million for Australia. The arguments were: 

 

 â¢ Environmentally,  Australia  is  not  North  America.  It  is  North  Africa.  This  limits  our   

 population potential substantially. 

 â¢ Our  population  growth  is  coastal.  But  the  wholesale  urbanization  of  our  Eastern  coastal  

 strip  from  the  mountains  to  the  sea  is  unacceptable.  50  million  people  represents  12  

 Sydneys. 

 â¢ A higher population requires higher taxes. 50 million needs a trillion dollars more in taxes. 

 â¢ Population  is  a  Commonwealth  responsibility  but  Sydney  is  the  honey  pot.  This  means  

 Sydney suffers the pressures of population disproportionately. 

 â¢ Small  is  beautiful.  Prosperity  does  not  come  from  sheer  weight  of  numbers  but  from  

 knowledge eg Finland 

 â¢ Australia does not have an aged population. We are a young country compared to Japan or 

 Germany. 

 â¢ Immigration was needed for a labour-intensive economy, not a global knowledge economy 

 â¢ Population  expansion  must  await  new  technical  fixes  which  improve  our  ability  to  carry  

 population on Australia’s resource base. 

 â¢ Globally  it  is  population  expansion  that  has  produced  poverty,  misery  and  environmental  

 degradation. 

 

  Some comment on each of these is helpful, for each embodies some partial truth, but only that. 

 As with much in the migration field these propositions appeal to the direct and observable and ignore 

 the  indirect  and  subtle.  As  such  they  are  populist  rather  than  educative,  and  they  do  not  in  this  area  

 exercise leadership through information and persuasion. For example: 

 

 (a)  We  may  not  be  North  America,  but  the  Jones  Committee  on  Australia’s  Carrying  Capacity  

 (Jones 1994) did find  that our northern plains are a biophysical homologue of Southern China 

 with 1/500th the population-and that we have twice the renewable water per capita of the United 

 States.  Our  population  density  is  2.6  persons  per  square  kilometre.  The  Netherlands  has  385  

 persons per square kilometer. 

 

 (b) Our population growth is certainly predominantly coastal, but critique of a 50 million Australian 

 population is really attack on a straw man and even so the associated twelve 12 Sydneys would 

 each be an average 700kms apart. And for a more realistic 30 million population, that is seven 

 Sydneys, bearing in mind that Sydney is only the 67th world city in population and that 5 cities 

 have Australia’s total population and 25 have more than 10 million.  

 

 (c)  The  cost  of  a  larger  population  is  of  course  a  larger  tax  aggregate.  But  every  study  available  

 shows that migration in the Australian pattern produces as much tax as it requires outlays-and, 

 indeed,  that  there  is  a  surplus  for  government  arising  from  the  overseas  funded  education,  

 working  age  and  good  health  of  migrants  (Access  Economics  2002).  The  marginal  cost  of  

 infrastructure extension is below the marginal tax receipts of migration. But this is caught up in 

 the buckpassing of Australian fiscal federalism, where it suits a state premier such as Mr Carr to 

 shift blame for congestion to the Commonwealth over immigration while reaping the rewards of 

 global cosmopolitanism that are only feasible with that immigration. 

 

 (d) Mr Carr exaggerates the population pressure on Sydney from immigration. It is true that Sydney 

 receives the lion’s share of new settlers. But it is equally true that Sydney’s population growth 

 rate is no more than the national average, as Garnaut (2002) has demonstrated. Indeed even in 

 absolute  terms,  Greater  Brisbane  has  been  growing  as  much  or  more  than  Greater  Sydney.  

 Internal  migration  is  the  explanation,  and  is  almost  an  automatic  stabilizer,  responding  to  

 Sydney property prices  as  they rise  under  the  constraint  of  limited  release  of  new land  by the  

 NSW  Government.  Mr  Carr’s  Sydney  receives  an  educated,  globally  integrated  work  force  in  

 exchange  for  retirees  and  welfare  dependents  moving  out  to  cheaper  locations.  There  are  

 problems  indeed,  but  they  are  those  of  poor  planning,  infrastructure  and  land  release  policies,  

 not  excessive  population  growth.  Indeed  even  on  the  premier’s  own  proclaimed  turf  of  

 environmental enhancement, NSW has lagged substantially on commitments  and in comparison 

 with other states in a whole range of public transport, emission control and like policies. In these 

 circumstances, scapegoating and blame-shifting becomes an almost inevitable feature of policy-but  a  most  unfortunate  one  when  it  all  too  easily  lends  itself  to  encouraging  a  climate  of  

 uncertainty over some dimensions of our multi-cultural society. 

 

 (e)  Certainly  population  alone  does  not  guarantee  prosperity.  Otherwise  Bangladesh  would  be  

 wealthy and Finland poor. But its absence does not guarantee affluence either. Otherwise Chad 

 would  be  rich  and  the  USA  would  be  poor.  The  point  is  that  of  conditionality  and  

 complementarity. The link from population scale to real income per capita is a conditional one. 

 A  rich  industrial  country  that  can  properly  invest  for  a  growing  workforce  can  obtain  payoffs  

 from  a  larger  population  that  poorer  countries  and  low  population  growth  countries  cannot.  

 Cross  -country  studies  have  trouble  incorporating  these  complementarities  and  their  

 interdependence. But single country historical studies do not-and they support this interpretation 

 eg for Australia see Pope and Withers (1995) 

 

 (f)  We  are  indeed  a  young  country  demographically  compared  to  Japan,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  

 Korea and many others. But we are rapidly catching up. Our aged population share will double 

 by 2030 under present trends, from six workers for every aged to three workers for every aged 

 person. We do have a window of opportunity to get our policy settings right. But as a nation we 

 must  beware  the  complacency  that  a  short  electoral  cycle  may  condone.  As  such  we  need  

 political leadership that will display the necessary vision in this area. 

 

 (g)  Immigration  is  not  needed  for  a  labour-intensive  economy,  unless  it  is  a  national  ambition  to  

 remain an economy predicated on raw labour. It was precisely because Australia turned its back 

 on its nineteenth century commitment to open trade and investment, skilled labour importation 

 and  strong  domestic  infrastructure  and  education  investment  within  free  markets,  that  our  pre-eminent  position  in  pre  capita  income  was  progressively  lost  over  the  twentieth  century.  We  

 turned  inward,  stopped  investing  in  ourselves,  took  in  unskilled  labour  and  built  a  system  of  

 protection  based  on  rural  rents  that  made  us  sclerotic.  Strong  human  capital  formation,  both  

 domestic and imported, is precisely what is needed in the new global knowledge economy. 

 

 (h)  Mr  Carr  believes  technology comes  like  manna  from heaven.  Yet  it  can  come  as  readily from 

 navel-gazing-and the more navels the more ideas. Or, as endogenous growth theory has it, the 

 more  output  we  have  the  more  likely  we  are  to  find  ways  to  improve  on  that.  Australian  

 economist  Ron  Duncan  (1997)  shows  how  the  Green  Revolution  conforms  to  this  prediction-and Popp (2002) gives precise elasticities for induced environmental innovation. Thus both for 

 innovation  in  general  and  for  environmental  innovation  in  particular,  waiting  for  a  technology  

 fix  is  again  precisely  the  wrong  policy.  The  market  aided  by  market  compatible  policies  can  

 reduce environmental damage and produce innovation supporting environmental sustainability. 

 

 (i) Globally, the world is facing a decline of population from the third quarter of this century. The 

 same  forces  which  have  produced  ageing  as  a  problem  for  industrial  countries  are  reducing  

 fertility  dramatically  world  wide.  The  drivers  are  women’s  education  and  work  and  

 contraception. The population bomb is not the threat it was. If it ever was-because there is much 

 truth to Sen’s observation that no country with a free press has ever had a famine. The problems 

 are  those  of  institutions  and  distribution,  not  population,  resources  and  technology.  Duncan  

 (1997)  calculates  that  global  output  of  cereals  (the  main  food  source  for  most  people)  has  

 increased by 2.7 percent a year since 1950, whereas population has grown at 1.9 per cent. This 

 rather  disproves  the  Malthusian  pessimism  whereby  food  will  grow  arithmetically  and  

 population geometrically.  

 

  In  principle  a  way  through  such  a  complexity  of  contending  incentives  and  impacts,  and  

 associated rhetoric and selective argumentation, is to move to large scale modeling to try and embody 

 and  quantify  the  full  range  of  drivers  of  economic  change  and  environmental  outcomes  and  their  

 interdependence.  Such  an  endeavour  recently in  Australia  was  to  be  found  in  the  work  conducted  by 

 the  Wildlife  Ecology  Division  of  CSIRO  for  the  Commonwealth  Immigration  Department  (Foran,  

 2002).  But,  while  well-funded  and  well-intentioned,  it  fell  well  short  of  the  mark  because  it  failed  to  

 blend  modern  economic  principles  with  contemporary  scientific  insight.  Indeed  the  model  is  not  so  

 much scientific as primitive economic, in the sense of the classical growth economics of two centuries 

 ago.  As  such  it  appropriately  re-introduced  natural  resource  use  into  the  production  process,  but  it  

 ignored  the  subsequent  neoclassical  recognition  also  of  the  crucial  role  of  prices  in  inducing  

 conservation  of  scarce  resources  and  the  new  growth  theory  recognition  of  induced  technological  

 change. On the population side, the neoclassical recognition of substitution even in the family sphere 

 also helps understand why there is ongoing reduction of birth rates, rather than unrelenting population 

 pressure. For an effective critique of the CSIRO work see Wooden (2002)  

 

 Immigration and Greenhouse 

  Of  course  the  market  is  not  the  answer  to  all  things.  In  particular  it  does  not  deal  well  with  

 externalities,  public  good  and  commons  problems,  though  improved  property  rights  allocations  can  

 assist  the  market  in  many cases.  But  in  matters  of  the  environment  some  forms  of  market  failure  can  

 still  be  of  the  essence.  This  is  most  clear  in  relation  to  a  global  problem  such  as  greenhouse  gas  

 emissions. . Interesting work on this and its possible linkage to population for Australia has in fact been 

 provided by economists. 

 

  Originally the Business Council of Australia (1991) commissioned work that linked greenhouse 

 emissions to population scenarios. The identity I =PAT, where I is impact, P is population, A is attitude 

 or  behaviour  and  T  is  technology,  summarized  a  simple  accounting  framework  for  this  purpose,  and  

 spreadsheet  analysis  showed  population  growth  as  a  major  force  behind  growth  of  greenhouse  

 emissions. The National Population Council (1992) drew attention to the fact, however, that while the 

 immigrant  component  of  population  growth  added  to  Australian  emissions  it  reduced  emissions  

 elsewhere,  so  that  net  greenhouse  effects  were  smaller  than  a  purely  national  analysis  showed.  Most  

 recently  Turton  and  Hamilton  (1999)  have  revisited  this  conclusion  and,  quantifying  emission  

 reduction elsewhere from emigration to Australia, conclude that the net effect of Australian population 

 growth  is  still  very  large.  The  essential  basis  for  this  conclusion  is  the  attribution  of  per  capita  

 Australian  emissions  to  migrants  here,  and  source  country  effects  are  calculated  using  per  capita  

 emissions there. Since Australia is a high fossil fuel using country in per capita terms, the conclusion 

 follows. This is an improvement over the earlier BCA and NPC work. But it is not conclusive. 

 

 In particular the result can be criticized because: 

 

 (a)  it  attributes  average  use  in  source  countries  to  migrants  who  may  have  higher  than  average  

 emission patterns there but not in Australia eg business and skilled migrants; 

 (b)  it  uses  current  patterns  of  emissions  whereas  in  fast-growing  source  countries  emissions  may  

 grow faster than in Australia in the future; 

 (c) other environmental damages in both locations are not considered by such a narrow indicator of 

 environmental  welfare,  but  it  is  quite  possible  that  in  other  dimensions  of  ecology  Australian  

 impacts are better than in less-regulated source locations; and 

 (d) the possible greater efficacy of alternative policies addressed at the behaviour of all residents of 

 Australia is not considered. 

 

  Overall  the  Turton-Hamilton  analysis  would  be  at  one  with  the  Guest-McDonald  approach  in  

 accepting  great  benefit  from  low  fertility,  since  it  reduces  aggregate  population  growth.  Turton-

 Hamilton might be less committed to a consumption per head maximand, but in greenhouse matters the 

 low population implication is the same, if the analysis is accepted. 

 

  By contrast, work by Swan Spiller  for the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and 

 Engineering  (2001)  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  population-related  environmental  impacts  and  the  

 opportunities for their reasonable remediation even with only existing technology and concludes that : 

 “It  is  not  appropriate  (and  indeed  simplistic)  to  use  population  as  the  only  policy  option  to  address  

 environmental  concerns  whilst  maintaining  environmentally  damaging  technological,  lifestyle  and  

 economic arrangements into the future. There are a wide range of technological, behavioural, pricing 

 and settlement planning strategies (52 identified) that could be applied to address the four population-related environmental issues” (p.21) 

 

 IV. Conclusion 

 

  Much  Australian  economic  analysis  of  immigration  has  focussed  on  the  relatively  short-run  

 effects on aggregates such as unemployment, wages, inflation, public finance and the foreign debt. Yet 

 the general finding in all of these areas is that the effects have been reasonably balanced or, where not, 

 they  have  in  fact  been  marginally  positive  for  the  Australian  macro-economy  and  for  Australian  

 residents. 

 

  Of course further work may be needed to examine and refine these findings further. And there 

 remains the long and arduous task of persuading both decision-makers and public opinion that fear of 

 generally  adverse  effects  may  mostly  be  myths.  Economists  faced  just  such  a  task  earlier  in  

 recommending the benefits of tariff reduction and other market liberalization, so that it can be done - 

 though eternal vigilance is needed. 

 

  But an even greater research priority might now lie with examining implications for our longer-run future. In this present paper issues of per capita income growth, population ageing, regional growth 

 and greenhouse emissions growth were highlighted as major issues in research and in current political 

 debate over immigration and population. 

 

  A  distinctive  feature  of  Australian  economics  has  been  its  close  orientation  to  policy  and  a  

 willingness to  draw on a  range  of quantitative  methods to  put empirical  flesh on the  bones of theory.  

 Sometimes  the  theory  and  empirical  method  are  inappropriately  applied  without  due  recognition  of  

 their limitations. That is the case in the way in which some economics is addressing some of the current 

 core issues in  immigration economics and policy, as this paper has sought to demonstrate. 

 

  At the same time this is not to condemn the endeavour. Clearly stated assumptions, transparent 

 logic,  full  data  documentation  and  competent  statistical  methods,  for  all  their  faults  in  practice,  do  

 remain  the  best  way to  advance  understanding  when  operating  in  a  contestable  marketplace  of  ideas.  

 Professional  economics  on  immigration  issues  in  Australia  happily illustrates  this  proposition  and  we  

 can look forward over time to increasing convergence based on expanding knowledge. Then new areas 

 of contestation will emerge to challenge our intellects for the good of our societies. 

 

  Whether this Australian journey can mean much for European discourse and policy is a whole 

 new  paper.  But  my  own  view  is  that  much  can  indeed  be  learned  from  the  policies  and  the  role  of  

 research  in  underpinning  those  policies  in  the  Australian  case,  which  I  believe  overall  provides  an  

 interesting blend of reasonably successful policy and research by world standards. 

 

  Good economic theory and empirical research help underpin understanding and sensible policy. 

 They  do  not  guarantee  it  -  as  populist  politics  and  rent-seeking  will  often  undermine  public  interest  

 outcomes. Also, at times, the economics itself can be faulty and inadequate. But the belief that sustains 

 independent  scholars  interested  in  policy  is  that  ongoing  accumulation  of  systematic  knowledge  

 improves the prospects for constraining policy error.

 i  This survey looks at post World War Two Australian research. A succint review of previous  discussion is given in Pope (1999).  ii

  The Bureau of Immigration Research (later Bureau of Immigration, Population and Multi-cultural  Research) was established in 1989 as an independent, professional research body within the  Commonwealth Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Its research was  published by the Australian Government Publishing Service and is listed in the Bureau’s Annual  Reports. 1989-1996.  iii

  Nevertheless there is a distinct diminution in this focus over time dating from floating the exchange  rate in 1983 and the subsequent flow-on reforms which served to mute the traditional balance of  payments crises and induced wage- inflation of concern to earlier economists.  iv

  For reasonable variations in migration program composition little difference in short-term macro-economic outcomes is observed eg Foster (1994), Cobb-Clark (2000). But longer-term effects eg on  per capita income, can be more marked eg Econtech (2001).  v

  Recent surveys of the macro-economic material are to be found in Foster and Withers (1992), Sloan  and Villaincourt (1994), Foster (1996), and Junankar et al (1998). Much of the stimulus for analysis in  these areas for the decade of the 1900s was Norman and Meikle (1985).
