 THE ROLE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN FOREIGN POLICY

 One of the most difficult challenges in any foreign policy is the  

 balancing of morality with realism - to find a: policy which  

 reflects the democratic ideals of Australians,  but does so  

 without damaging our national interest.

 If you ignore power politics,  if you believe that moral  

 principles alone can guide your relations with the rest of the  

 world, you will get it wrong.

 Like all politics, the politics of human rights must involve what  

 is possible.. '  -  -

 Whilst one might like to believe that there is an ultimate moral'/ '  'V- 

 order, we must accept the reality - that is, that the great  

 majority of states are authoritarian in nature.  Some have  

 totalitarian Communist regimes; many have one-party systems of  

 supposedly "socialist" bent;  many are governed by the military. 

 Few, are.democracies as Australia.

 The consequences of forgetting this reality will not only be to  

 leave you with a foreign policy that is largely futile, and  

 escapist,  but one which will harm the prosperity of the  

 community.  Good intentions alone do not make for a successful  

 foreign policy.

 . . .2/

 But to accept the reality of nationalism and the sovereignty of  

 the state, is not to accept for a moment that we should embrace  

 the view that morality has little or no role in internatipnal  

 relations. -

 Today it is accepted that questions of human rights have become  

 an important subject for international discussion and action. We  

 have seen national and international, official and  

 non-governmental bodies set up to promote the greater exercise of  

 human rights. The U.N. Declaration on Human Rights,  the  

 covenants, and various other Conventions and instruments reflect  

 a revolutionary change in attitude to human rights since the  

 horrors of the Second World War. '  .  .  .  â   â   .  " ~  .  '  .  .  /

 The Western alliance is not just a grouping of powers,  it is the  

 embodiment of these ideals.

 We should be proud to represent these values and we must '

 recognize that they may be lost if we do not assert them.

 The fact is that only democracies properly protect the rights of  

 all their citizens and it is for this reason that their survival  

 must be the first priority of those committed to the protection  

 of human rights.

 We need also to recognize the need both to maintain conventional  

 and nuclear forces. â   â   '  â   .  -  .1

 ' i  - Î; '  '  · ' / 

 *  V ' Western democracies in recent decades have increasingly assumed   that military power has lost its utility in the nuclear age.  

 Totalitarian regimes have declined to share this assumption.

 In Hungary, in Czechoslovakia,  Angola,  Ethiopia, Afghanistan and  

 Kampuchea,  the Soviet Union or its allies have achieved  

 considerable,results through the use of military power.

 It is obvious from my remarks that I believe human rights and  

 democratic values must form a integral part of foreign policy  

 under any Coalition Government.

 . . .4/

 But I also recognize that Australia lives and works not in the  

 Scandinavian Tundra, but in a region which does not share to the  

 same extent many of these values.  - â 

 We must recognize, two things about our region.

 Firstly,  that in applying moral standards to foreign policy, we  

 are not talking about compliance with some clear and generally  

 accepted international code of behaviour. Morals vary. 

 Furthermore, differences in culture, tradition, history and  

 developmental stages necessarily impart differences to the degree  

 to which state activity will be viewed as a violation of human  

 r ights.  .  ·  .  .

 I understand that much of today's seminar was to concentrate on  

 regional human rights issues such as East Timor and Irian Jaya as  

 well as discuss other issues such as South Africa.

 I spoke recently on these regional issues at a forum organized by  

 the Aus t r a l i a n  Institute of International Affairs on the  

 relationship between Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. â .

 I regret I must point out that I had my office telephone the  

 Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace to ascertain what  

 statements the" Commission had made on Human Rights in- Cambodia  

 and Afghanistan - my office was told that a statement had been  

 made on Cambodia in 1978, and nothing had been said on  

 Afghanistan I!

 Afghanistan is now in the seventh year of a struggle for  

 independence against Soviet occupation whose methods of warfare  

 have reached unparalleled depths of brutality.

 The Soviet Union has not only waged warfare against the Afghan

 rebels but has waged warfare against the civilian population. . â   '  -  .  " ~  /

 , / 

 - .  I , · ' ·  â  

 One example, the dropping of explosive devices disguised as

 children's toys resulting in the maiming and killing of many

 children adds a new dimension to the barbarity of warfare.

 But the Soviet effort in Afghanistan is not being fought by 

 military means, only.

 Areas under Soviet control have been the subject of attempts to 

 destroy the basic facets of Afghan culture.

 ... .7/

 The Hawke Labor Government has said little on the issue. The  

 Foreign Minister went to the Soviet Union and didn't even raise  

 the issue, because of so-called time restraints.

 Cambodia remains occupied by ten Vietnamese army infantry  

 divisions, associated support divisions and a country-wide  

 civilian military controlled apparatus.

 It is this occupation force which maintains a puppet regime in  

 Cambodia.

 A recent report by the Lawyers' Committee on International Human  

 Rights has summarized its observations as follows:

 It is Vietnam which continues to impose massive changes on  

 Cambodian society and its administration which has settled / 4  ' 

 300,000 refugees in Cambodia and gives them priority over  

 Cambodians.

 Yet the Australian Labor Government has continually adopted a  

 policy of appeasement of Vietnam and the Foreign Minister has  

 even called on the Foreign Minister of the Vietnamese puppet  

 Government of Kampuchea.

 The question remains why the Labor Government and many of the

 human rights organizations in Australia are prepared to overlook

 the appalling standards of behaviour of countries whose policies   â   â   ‘  -  ‘  â   / 

 and interests conflict sharply with our own interests, and those/;' *  -  .  â   fi 

 of the Western Alliance. They do this a-t the same time they atfe

 prepared to sharply criticize the actions and behaviour of

 friends in the region.

 It would be foolish to pretend that there can be no selectivity  

 in the application of human rights policy. Clearly, there will  

 be, for we live in a region where many of our neighbours do not  

 share our standards of freedom and democratic government.  .We  

 must recognize that we live on the rim of a region where  

 democracy is a comparatively new idea - where at best it is one  

 aspiration among a host of others, no less urgent.

 We must remember the third world tendency to stress collective  

 and economic rights,  sometimes at the expense of political  

 rights.  These countries will emphasise the priority they give to  

 nation-building and development.  Whilst we should resist any  

 suggestion that individual and political rights are unimportant  

 or subordinate,  we should at least be sympathetic to the third  

 world's stress on economic rights.

 We are friends with them because our interests are compatible and  

 because we share the desire for a stable and prosperous region.

 In pursuing a policy of human rights we should be clear about a  

 number of things v i  .

 / â 

 Firstly, our own fundamental commitment to democracy and freedom  

 must be unequivocal.  '  â   -

 Secondly, we should recognize the dangers that the totalitarian  

 regimes such as the Soviet Union pose to our way of life and rule  

 of law.  ~

 Thirdly, in assessing what human rights role we can play, we  

 should be careful to ensure that our actions will not be  

 counterproductive.

 The term human rights is very wide. At the root of difficulty in

 any discussion on this question is the definition accorded to the '  / «  â   â  

 term.

 Further, you cannot ignore economic, social and cultural rights,  

 as well as collective human rights, such as the right to self  

 determination and development.

 One must not forget that the vast majority of people around the  

 world place greater relevance to the struggle for basic  

 necessities - food, health, shelter and work.

 The Western concept of human rights is just that - a Western one. .  ' ' ' /

 Concepts of the state, society, family, god,, modernity - concepts  

 that we in the West consider part and parcel of our heritage, are  

 often hard to translate adequately into the idiom of the Third  

 world. '  '

 We must accept that each country produces its own domestic back  

 drop and that in each country's case, one must appreciate the  

 full local circumstances in determining Australia's response and  

 the appropriateness in making representations.

 As Foreign Minister, I oversaw Australia's election to the U.N.  

 Commission on Human Rights in 1977. I was pleased to note that  

 last year saw Australia's re-election to that body. '

 I believe it is possible, indeed essential, for the Government to  

 incorporate humanitarian principles into a coherent foreign 

 policy. Promotion of human dignity should be an essential 

 element in a democratic country's foreign policy, but must 

 necessarily be one, of many, objects of foreign policy.
