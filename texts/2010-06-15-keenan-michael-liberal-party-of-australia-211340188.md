 Michael Keenan 

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 

 Boat Kevin 137 puts further pressure on  border budget blowout   16/06/10  

 The illegal arrival of the 137th boat since Kevin Rudd rolled back the strong border  protection regime inherited from the Coalition, will lead to further cost blowouts in  the Rudd Government’s immigration budget, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Just a month ago the Rudd Government handed down a budget that contained a $1  billion cost blowout in immigration costs due to the Rudd Government’s border  protection failures. That budget was based on total arrivals in 2009/10 of 4,500  people,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “This latest boat arrival brings the total number of people to arrive in 2009/10 to  5,388 people, meaning the costs released just a month ago have already blown out,”  he said. 

 “Of greater concern is that the Rudd Government has based their 2010/11 budget for  managing asylum seekers on their estimate that the number of people to arrive  illegally by boat will fall by 60% to just 2,000 people. 

 “This is an absurd forecast that not even the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  believes. 

 “In Senate Estimates, Minister Evans stated ‘I am not very confident that we can with  any surety say that the 2,000 figure that is used for accounting purpose in that budget  paper can be supported.’ 

 “If Kevin Rudd’s own Ministers don’t believe their budget, how can they expect  anyone else to. Kevin Rudd has lost control of our borders and his own budget. 

 “If boats continue to arrive at their current rate of three a week and more than 600  people per month, Labor’s projected surplus will vanish, along with whatever is left  of Labor’s budget credibility,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “The state of Australia’s border protection system resembles the  current state of the Labor leadership -a complete shambles. 

 “The mounting public pressure on the Prime Minister to account for this  government’s long list of failures, most notably the complete collapse of our borders,  has sent the Labor ranks into crisis mode. 

 “However Kevin Rudd still believes this is a PR problem, when the reality is that it is  a problem caused by failed policy and a lack of leadership. 

 “Whether it is Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard that leads Labor to the polls at the next  election, it is clear that a Labor Government will always lack the resolve necessary to  secure Australia’s borders,” he said.
