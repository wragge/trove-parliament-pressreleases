 $2 MILLION IN SUPPORT SERVICES FOR SYRIAN REFUGEES   

 The Australian Government has committed more than $2 million over two years to  deliver CARE Australia’s Emergency Assistance and Safe Spaces for Crisis Affected  People in Jordan project.    

 The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton said the project would  support people who have been affected by the Syrian conflict and help them to rebuild  their lives.   

 “The project will provide 111,000 individuals with support and information to gain access  to essential services, as well as providing more than 1100 households with emergency  cash assistance to meet urgent protection needs,” Mr Dutton said    

 “More than 9000 individuals, including 2000 children, will receive additional services  including mental health support, and 600 women will receive training to develop  essential skills to create their livelihoods.   

 “This project expands on $1 million worth of services that the Australian Government  funded in the region through CARE Australia in 2015.   

 “This funding will be provided in addition to the Australian Government’s $220 million  assistance package, which will be delivered over three years from 2016-17, to support  for those affected by the crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting large  numbers of refugees.   

 “This work forms part of the Australian Government’s commitment to address the  humanitarian and longer term resilience needs in Syria, and supports our broader  contribution to the global management of refugees and displaced populations.”    

 Australia has committed more than $258 million to the humanitarian response to the  Syria and Iraq conflicts since 2011.
