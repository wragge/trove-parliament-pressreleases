 Daily Telegraph’s editorial bias trumps facts again; energy  efficiency saves money 

 22 Dec 2011 | Broadband, Communications & the Digital Economy / Climate change / Resources & Energy 

 The Daily Telegraph has launched another error-ridden attack on sensible policy today, the Australian Greens 

 said. 

 "Rupert Murdoch's Daily Telegraph is once again allowing its editorial bias to trump factual reporting, at great 

 cost to the community," Australian Greens Acting Leader, Senator Christine Milne, said. 

 "How sensible policies to help Australian householders save money and cut pollution can be twisted into a scare 

 campaign about increased costs is almost beyond imagining, but that is what the Daily Telegraph has done 

 "Apparently the Daily Telegraph would rather scare its readers with dishonest reporting than actually advise 

 them on how to reduce their living expenses. 

 "At the same time, today's Daily Telegraph editorial makes the bizarre claim that processing asylum seekers 

 onshore would be costly, when the facts plainly show that offshore processing is vastly more expensive. 

 "Whatever you think of the merits or otherwise of whether to process asylum seekers in Australia or elsewhere in 

 the region, this abuse of editorial power by telling readers a complete untruth undermines our democracy. 

 "Laurie Oakes said of a recent front page in the Daily Telegraph on the passage of the Clean Energy Future bills, 

 the ‘scary ridiculous headlines' are ‘not particularly accurate' and ‘not my idea of journalism [but] propaganda'. 

 The Daily Telegraph is doing it again on energy efficiency and asylum seekers. 

 "The Daily Telegraph's readers deserve more than to be subject to nasty and dishonest scare campaigns."
