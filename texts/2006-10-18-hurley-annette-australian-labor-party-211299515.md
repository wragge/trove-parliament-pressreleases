 Admission of failure by Howard Government in refugee  settlement services   

 Wednesday, 18 October 2006 

 

 The most recent DIMA Discussion Paper, titled “Measures to Improve Settlement  Outcomes for Humanitarian Entrants” ¹, and the Department’s Annual Report are  an admission of failure by the Howard Government in its handling of refugee  settlement.   

 The discussion paper, released yesterday, proposes the introduction of a  Complex Case Support Network (CCSN) which will provide greater assistance to  more complex refugee cases. 

 

 As pointed out in the Department’s Annual Report, the Government introduced  new arrangements for delivering settlement services under the Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) in October 2005, based on a  Departmental review. 

 

 One year later, the Government puts out its latest discussion paper in an attempt  to address its shortcomings in stealth.   

 “This shows that Minister Vanstone and the Howard Government have raised the  white flag with regard to providing quality refugee settlement services, and this is  a major concern to me because good settlement results in even better  integration,” Senator Hurley stated last night in Parliament.   

 “The Labor Party, service providers and clients have been saying for a long time  that the current settlement contract needs to more closely monitored.   

 “Currently, the Government has no way of clearly assessing contractual  compliance, complaints have been routinely mismanaged and now the Auditor  General’s Office is considering a formal inquiry,” she said. 

 

 “So what does the Howard Government now propose to do? Shovel more money  into the programme rather than address the major management problems of the  current $50 million contract,” Senator Hurley concluded.
