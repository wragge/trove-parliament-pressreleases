 MEDIA RELEASE

 SENATOR ROBERT HILL LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 Friday, February 12 17/93

 HILL RELEASES KEY FOREIGN POLICY PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill, today released a statement outlining the key principles and priorities of the Coalition's approach to foreign policy.

 Under an approach of "enlightened self-interest", the Coalition will clearly identify Australia's national interests and put those interests first.

 The primary aim of Coalition foreign policy will be to contribute to an Australia which is a significant economic and political power in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2000.

 The Coalition's foreign policy approach will be based on the principles which have provided the foundations of its political direction: a belief in liberal democracy; a

 commitment to liberal trade and economic policies; the search for global peace and stability; and the promotion of overseas aid and development.

 Adherence to these principles and the complex and challenging international environment dictate a foreign policy approach which is pragmatic and results-oriented.

 The Coalition will put economic and trade issues at the top of our foreign policy interests.

 It will also focus on the Asia-Pacific region because it is vital to Australia's future prosperity, and it is where our economic future lies.

 A Hewson government would give first priority to building strong and substantial bilateral ties with our neighbours.

 The Coalition will also pursue Australia's interests on a regional level. Throughout the world, there is an increasing emphasis on regionalism, and it is important Australia maximises the benefits and minimises the costs of such regionalism.

 The Coalition's foreign policy aims are strongly linked to domestic reform. Australia will have more to offer and more to gain if it works from a competitive economic bases.

 FOREIGN POLICY AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIC REFORM

 Our foreign policy goals can only be fully achieved when domestic economic reform results in an Australia that is able to compete effectively in the international marketplace.

 For Australia to fulfil its potential we need to implement domestic structural reform. We need to remove the cost disadvantages imposed on Australian exporters. Especially needed is reform of the waterfront, telecommunications and land transport. Reform of the tax system and our labour markets is also essential for greater competitiveness, as is the reduction of protection to negligible levels by the Year 2000.

 Domestic economic reform is essential to make Australia stronger and provide the opportunity for Australians to have a better quality of life.

 Our foreign policy aims - based on liberal principles, focused on the Asia-Pacific, with priority to economic and trade issues - are strongly linked to domestic reform. If Australia's domestic economy is competitive then we will be better respected as an equal and valuable international partner. Australia will have more to offer and more to gain in foreign relations if we work from a competitive economic base.

 In contrast to Labor's failings, the Liberal/National Coalition has determined new priorities in foreign policy. We will pursue these priorities in a clear and focused manner. We have faith in Australia's ability to meet the challenges of this changing world and to ensure security, protect our way of life and maximise economic opportunities.

 THE HEWSON GOVERNMENT FOREIGN AFFAIRS STATEMENT

 Australia needs a more focused and hard-headed foreign policy. In an approach which we call enlightened self-interest, a Hewson Government will clearly identify Australia's national interests and put those interests first. Enlightened self-interest will maximise Australia's potential without sacrificing the values and principles which are at the heart of our national interest.

 This statement outlines the Liberal/National approach to foreign policy. It is not designed as an exhaustive survey of the detail of Australia's foreign relations. Instead, we believe that it is more important to outline the approach and the priorities that we will bring to each of Australia's international relationships.

 The primary aim of foreign policy in a Hewson Government will be to contribute to an Australia which is a significant economic and political power in the Asia-Pacific region by the Year 2000. The purpose of this is to ensure Australia's future political and economic security. Yet it does not mean neglecting traditional friends and allies

 or new opportunities throughout the world.

 However, it is the strategy which will best equip Australia to respond to the challenges presented by recent rapid global change. The new patterns of global interaction will profoundly affect Australia's future place in the world system.

 THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

 The pace and magnitude of global change due to the unprecedented events of the 1990s will require new policy directions as we enter an uncharted phase in world history.

 In the last few years we have seen the end of the Cold War and superpower competition. The terrible threat of superpower nuclear confrontation has been largely removed, and instead we see Russia and the United States cooperating in the destruction of nuclear weapons. Despite this, the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological proliferation in smaller states remains one of the more frightening aspects of this changing world.

 The pace of political change in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has been astounding. The decline of communism as a workable political system has had tremendous repercussions throughout the world. The result is that there are only five remaining communist states - China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cuba -

 four of them in the Asia-Pacific region.

 The demand for political change and the loosening of superpower constraints has

 meant a global increase in ethnic tensions, nationalist rivalries, racial conflicts and religious animosities. This has created dissent, conflict, and in a number of cases, war. The international balance of the past has been upset and it will take some time before new and more peaceful patterns can emerge.

 Already we see the consequences of such demands: for example, in South Africa with its tense and violent transition to non-apartheid rule, in the Commonwealth of Independent States as they struggle to come to terms with the collapse of communism, in the former Yugoslavia where nationalist sentiments have erupted into war, and in Burma with brutal authoritarian suppression of the people's will.

 Accompanying these political changes is the reality of growing global economic interdependence. Economic transactions in one part of the world have instant impact on the rest of the world through interlinked financial and trade networks. State sovereignty over economic affairs is being challenged. Responses vary and range from inclinations towards protection and managed trade, to attempts to achieve genuine liberalisation of world trade.

 The uncertainty in the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has propelled economic issues to the forefront of state concern. In order to manage rapid economic growth and expanding trade, the liberalisation of world markets is essential. Yet the tensions involved in the negotiations have contributed to greater economic regionalism.

 The growing integration of the European Community, the North American Free Trade Area, the phenomenal growth of East Asia, and tensions in the crucial United States - Japan relationship have resulted in greater identification of regional

 economic interests. The challenge will be to maintain a liberal international trading order whilst accommodating the interests of particular regions.

 A result of these profound changes has been a shift from a bipolar to a multipolar world. Apart from Russia and the United States, Japan, China, India and the increasingly integrated Western European states are adopting a more visible political role in world affairs.

 Accompanying this is the revival of international organisations as relevant and useful world bodies. The recent rapid rise to prominence of the United Nations is now out of step with its structure and financial resources which are more suited to its past, more limited, role. There is increased demand for its peacekeeping function, and more recently, the requirement that it go beyond peacekeeping to nation-building, state administration and peacemaking.

 The region of Australia's primary interest - the Asia-Pacific region - has been equally affected by global change. For many years, the communist threat determined much of Asia's political and security relations. The fear of the Soviet Union and its satellite states, and also of China, bonded most of the region's security to the United States. Through its series of bilateral friendships and alliances, the United States

 2

 provided valuable stability which allowed rapid economic growth.

 East Asia is still experiencing impressive economic growth rates, despite some slowing. Asia is also adopting a greater regional economic identity, partly through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process. Pressure in some circles towards an East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) is a further illustration of this trend.

 There are signals that Asia will adopt a more cohesive stance in the face of any perceived threats to its interests from the Uruguay Round of the GATT or inward-looking moves in North America. The challenge is to maintain and expand liberal economic policies which allowed the region's rapid growth.

 This growing economic cohesiveness has not yet translated to the political and security spheres. Throughout the region we are witnessing an expansion and modernisation of defence forces. There is uncertainty as to the future United States security role under a new Clinton Administration, although the regional preference is for continuing and active US involvement.

 However, regional states realise the need to adopt increased responsibility for security. There remain areas of uncertainty: for example, the purpose of North Korea's nuclear program, competing claims of sovereignty in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, instability in Burma and uncertainty in Cambodia. Regional states will be challenged to find solutions which enhance peace and stability.

 Throughout the Asia-Pacific region there are also demands for political change. The region is characterised by its diversity of political systems, ranging from democratic to military regimes. Movements for democracy and ethnic nationalism are likely to become two of the more significant factors affecting the region, especially if they are coupled with military suppression of these demands.

 Also affecting the Asia-Pacific is the increasing prominence of global issues such as human rights, the environment, refugees and HTV/AIDS. These are issues about which there exist differences in attitudes and interpretation, and part of the challenge is to find ways - both global and regional - to wrestle with them more effectively than in the past.

 The Asia-Pacific region and the world are currently characterised by complexity and uncertainty. The much heralded "new world order" to replace Cold War polarity is based on assumptions of cooperation: partnership in solving the world's crises, unity in motivation, and a willingness to take collective action against intransigent states. Yet despite a few exceptions - such as the coalition of forces against Iraq - this is

 likely to remain an ideal for the medium to long term.

 It is not going to be competition between two ideologies and two superpower blocs which will characterise the 1990s world. Instead, there is already evidence to demonstrate that conflict within states, competition between states, and increasing

 competition between regions will be our future challenges.

 3

 Australia needs to respond to, and help to shape, the new global patterns which are

 emerging. Economic interdependence, political multipolarity, regional identification, local conflicts and the rise of global bodies means a world which is less predictable than in the past.

 LIBERAL PRINCIPLES

 To meet these new challenges and opportunities the Liberal/National Coalition will apply to foreign policy, principles which have long provided the foundations for our political direction.

 Liberal Democracy

 The political philosophy of liberalism is based on a commitment to freedom and liberty, and faith in the dignity and worth of the individual. The right of all human beings to be free and to be respected lies at the heart of our national interest.

 We are committed to the principle of democracy, where each individual can exercise his or her right to participation in the society and government of their nations. Freedom of speech, religion and association are essential attributes of a democratic state.

 We are committed to upholding universal human rights, which safeguard the right to life and freedom. The state needs to be responsible for the protection and promotion of basic human rights, not only within state borders, but internationally through appropriate measures.

 And we are committed to the encouragement of individual enterprise as the way to advance society in order to obtain a better quality of life.

 We believe these principles need to be respected throughout the world, and in the pursuit of Australia's national interest, we will uphold and promote the principles of a liberal democracy. We will be particularly concerned with human rights and as

 we pursue our interests, we will not hesitate to raise difficult issues in a sensible and consistent manner.

 Economic Liberalisation

 With our commitment to liberal democracy is our firm belief in the necessity for liberal trade and economic policies, both within Australia and throughout the world.

 Our commitment is to domestic economic liberalisation, privatisation and export growth. The encouragement of private enterprise through the removal of barriers and constraints to commerce is a key part of our philosophy. In this way, we believe that productivity will be enhanced and a more secure future for each and every Australian can be achieved.

 Similarly, we apply these principles to our approach to international trade. The

 4

 Liberal/National parties are committed to a liberal and open international trading

 order. The free trade of goods and services, we believe, is the most effective way to enhance national and international wellbeing.

 We will work to encourage the maintenance of a liberal economic system, and we will illustrate our resolve by addressing the domestic structural reforms Australia requires for a more open and efficient economy.

 Peace and Stability

 Fundamental to liberalism is the search for global peace and stability. It is in Australia's national interests to encourage and enhance stability in order to create a secure and predictable environment in which to pursue national aims.

 A Hewson Government will conduct its international relations in a way which is sensitive to the culture and concerns of our partners. We will emphasise shared values and enhance our ability to communicate quickly and effectively in order to achieve stable relations with our friends and neighbours.

 We are also aware that security amongst states requires confident diplomatic relations. We have a commitment to building confidence on security issues and increasing the transparency of security actions. Consistent and effective diplomacy can contribute to diffusing tensions at local, regional and international levels.

 Aid and Development

 Overseas aid and the promotion of development are important parts of liberalism in the 1990s. Poverty in developing countries robs over a billion people of basic human dignity and exposes them to conditions which threaten the future existence of entire communities. Reducing poverty can also contribute to increased stability and security.

 The Liberal approach to aid gives priority to the goal of reducing poverty in developing countries, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.

 However, notwithstanding the priority of our region, we recognise the extent of the tragedy in Africa and reinforce our commitment to maintain humanitarian and refugee funding, and to support multilateral and Non-Government Organisation (NGO) efforts.

 An effective aid program will utilise the best of Australian goods and services and thus also bring significant longer term trade benefits for Australia. To maximise such benefits, however, aid must first be effective in its basic goal of reducing poverty.

 The details of how the Coalition will lift the effectiveness of the Australian overseas aid program, and in particular the development of comprehensive country programs, are set out in Foreign Aid: A Blueprint For An Improved Program.

 APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY

 These principles and the complex and challenging international environment dictate an approach to foreign policy which is pragmatic and results-oriented. For too long under Labor, Australian foreign policy has aimed to do too much, and achieved too little.

 The Liberal/National Coalition will adopt a focused approach where national interests are clearly identified and our fundamental values promoted. This approach of enlightened self-interest, we believe, is the way in which foreign policy can contribute to a strong and secure Australia.

 The aim of enlightened self-interest is to contribute to ensuring Australia is a major economic and political power in the Asia-Pacific region by the Year 2000.

 The Liberal/National Coalition will put economic and trade issues at the top of our foreign policy priorities.

 The Asia-Pacific region is vital to Australia's future prosperity. It is the obvious place for us to focus, given Australia's proximity. But more importantly, it is also obvious in terms of the economic dynamism and growth potential of the Asian

 economies.

 The Asia-Pacific is where our greatest economic opportunities lie. In 1991-92, eight of our top ten trading partners, on a country basis, were from the Asia-Pacific region, with Japan as our most important trade and economic relationship.

 Australia has enormous potential to increase trade with the region: to export more raw materials, primary products and high value-added manufactures, and to develop exports of educational, financial, tourism, communications and other services.

 However, under Labor, Australia has not adequately capitalised on the opportunities in Asia. In many instances Australia's market share has actually decreased despite Labor's rhetoric and our comparative advantages.

 Although our focus will be on the Asia-Pacific, we will conduct a multitrack and integrated trade strategy aimed at realising opportunities wherever they exist.

 We will not neglect existing trading partners, such as the European Community to which we send 12.5 percent of our exports and take 20.3 percent of our imports, or other areas of the world where trade and investment opportunities exist.

 We will endeavour to benefit from the opportunities which could arise from the North American Free Trade Area, just as we will work to expand our trade with other important partners such as Western Europe and the Middle East, as well as South Asia, Latin America and the fledgling market economies of the CIS and eastern European states.

 6

 This emphasis on trade and economic issues, as well as our other foreign policy

 commitments - such as our concern with the importance of democracy, peace and stability - needs to be seen as an application of the fundamental aims of liberalism. It is our belief that the realisation of these aims will create the conditions necessary for individual, national and international enterprise.

 When we support political change in places such as South Africa, when we condemn human rights abuses in Burma, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Bosnia - our aim is for peace and stability, and thus an environment in which individual enterprise can flourish.

 To achieve our goals, our approach to foreign policy will need to be prioritised at three levels: bilateral, regional and global.

 Bilateral Relations: The First Priority

 The Liberal/National Coalition will give first priority to building strong and substantial bilateral ties with our neighbours.

 The policies of Labor have not taken into account the importance of bilateral relations based on mutual respect and a sound appreciation of bilateral interests and priorities.

 Labor's lack of focus on bilateral relations has led to an absence of clarity in many of Australia's key relationships.

 Australia's relationship with China, for example, requires greater consistency and focus - something not achieved under Labor. Australia needs a more substantial trade and economic relationship with China. Although Australia's exports to China were worth $1.5 billion in 1991-1992, Australia accounts for only two percent of China's imports.

 However, in order to do this, we will not betray values which are at the cornerstone of our national interest. We will continue to voice directly to the Chinese Government our concerns about human rights, such as in Tibet, and security issues, such as China's missile sales.

 We also believe that our relationship with China cannot be pursued at the expense of other important trading partners - particularly Taiwan and Hong Kong. We can maintain a one China policy whilst being much more forthright in developing economic relations with Taiwan.

 The Coalition's approach is detailed in Australia-China Relations: Time For A Realistic Approach and Australia-Taiwan: The Coalition's Approach.

 One of the most challenging of our bilateral relations will be with Indonesia. Australia and Indonesia differ in the assessment of many of the values which we regard as fundamental. There is, therefore, a need to build sensitively a mature

 7

 relationship based on those interests which we have in common, whilst seeking to

 better understand each other's differences.

 The Coalition will promote Australia's potential to provide goods and services, participate in joint ventures in the manufacturing and resources sectors, and other opportunities provided by Indonesia's expanding economy and rising standard of living.

 More mature and equal relations are needed with all the ASEAN countries. Strong and substantial relations, as outlined in ASEAN-Australia: Creating A Confident Relationship, with these neighbours will be a very important priority.

 A Hewson Government will devote greater departmental resources to routine diplomacy in order to better understand the interests and priorities of our neighbours. We will strengthen channels of communication and establish a basis for consultation on a whole range of issues, thus diminishing the chances of any

 difficulties which could embarrass or harm Australia's interests.

 Australian expressions of concern on sensitive issues will be informed by an awareness of the values of the society to which they are directed. We need to recognise that throughout the world, there are different approaches to issues such as human rights, democracy, security and the environment.

 Australia must not feel threatened by the new Asian assertiveness which is becoming more apparent on these issues. Neither do we need to apologise for our identity or our values. Instead, there must be constructive attempts to work together to overcome the difficulties which will inevitably arise from differences.

 The Coalition will also maintain and strengthen established bilateral relations with longstanding partners such as New Zealand and the United States, and explore areas for further development of these relationships.

 We will place high priority on Australia's relationship with Japan, as outlined in Japan's Role in the Changing World: An Australian Perspective. We will continue to develop the economic relationship, whilst being sensitive to the debate in Japan about its future world and regional role.

 Regional Relations

 The second level at which a Hewson Government will pursue Australia's interests is the regional level. Throughout the world there is an increasing emphasis on regionalism as a way of managing and promoting common interests. It is likely that regionalism will play an increasingly important role in global affairs in the next ten years.

 Regionalism often reduces the scale, and thus enhances the capabilities of states to coordinate actions to mutual advantage.

 8

 For states such as Australia, coordinated and agreed positions adopted by a region

 can also have greater impact than smaller states acting alone.

 Regionalism can be an effective policy option in advancing self interest.

 In Australia's region of primary interest - the Asia-Pacific - regional structures are not well developed. However, there are signs of change and it is important that Australia locks into regional changes to our advantage.

 Economic cooperation through the APEC process is the most developed form of Asia-Pacific regionalism. The Liberal/National Coalition believes that APEC has the potential to be a useful economic forum for the promotion of regional interests.

 However, APEC needs to achieve practical results on regional trade liberalisation, and explicitly involve business and private enterprise, before it can realise its potential. For more detail see Regional Diplomacy: Advancing Australia's Interests.

 We will work to avoid possible moves towards an Asian trading group which is not GATT-consistent and which might be formed as a result of a failure of APEC to meet the expectations of Asian member states.

 The Liberal/National Coalition also sees the importance of being closely involved in regional security discussions. Our approach is outlined in Security in the Asia-Pacific: Alliances and Dialogue, The New World Partnership? A Strategy for the Asia-Pacific Region and in the Coalition's defence policy - A Strong Australia.

 We will maintain our emphasis on the importance of Australia's alliance with the United States, and encourage the United States to continue its valuable and stabilising role in the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world. We also acknowledge United States' efforts to restructure security relations so that regional states bear a greater share of the cost of security arrangements.

 Although regional security cooperation is limited at present, in the post-Cold War era, regional states are dealing more directly with security issues, although developing consensus on this is likely to be gradual.

 We support the regional preference for building security discussions around the annual ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference. We also believe that proposals for formal regional security structures are premature.

 A regional approach to security problems is likely to be the most effective. Cambodia is an example of the first steps towards regional cooperation on a pressing security issue. The region has accepted much of the responsibility for implementing the Cambodian peace agreement. Yet Cambodia will be in need of continued support

 in its post-election phase and will require assistance in order to make the aim of peace and democracy a reality.

 A Hewson Government will also give priority attention to the South Pacific region and Papua New Guinea. Small states will be faced by a number of pressures. In

 9

 trade and economics, as well as security, the Pacific Island states are fragile and

 open, with small resource bases. The economies of many are fundamentally aid dependent and periodically set back as a result of natural disasters.

 We believe that stability will be important for the steady economic development of South Pacific states. Potential problems are likely to be the result of internal forces of instability. The Coalition recognises the importance of development aid to these nations and will be responsive to the unique nature of the problems suffered by small states.

 The Liberal/National Coalition believes that Australia's national interest will be served by encouraging regional cooperation on humanitarian and human rights issues. Although differences in history, culture, political systems and stages of development have constrained cooperation, we will work towards the identification of joint humanitarian priorities.

 We recognise the remarkable achievements in democracy in the last few years, particularly in Latin America, but also the developing democracy in evidence in parts of Asia and in Russia. We recognise that it is in Australia's interests to continue to foster and support that process. However, we are also aware of its fragility and believe that through economic linkages to mutual advantage, we can support and

 strengthen new democracies.

 The Coalition believes that the promotion of human rights is important for humanitarian reasons and for the positive role respect for human rights can play in the development of the region.

 Australia will not be afraid to tackle the difficult issue of human rights. Instead of simply acting as the region's moral policeman, the Coalition will attempt to build support for a process of regional cooperation.

 As outlined in An Asia-Pacific Human Rights Cooperation Group - An Idea, we have suggested the establishment of an informal regional group which could have as its ultimate aim the promulgation of a regional human rights convention. We will work with our neighbours to achieve a consensus which recognises both regional sensitivities and the universal character of rights.

 We have said much about the abuse of human rights in places such as Burma -Burma: The Coalition's Perspective, and Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka: A Commonwealth Role?, but our emphasis on human rights is due also to our belief that respect for human rights will encourage stability, which will in turn lead to economic growth.

 The Coalition believes that there is room for greater regional action on the problem of refugees. The repatriation of the 370 000 Cambodian refugees, the 250 000 Burmese refugees in Bangladesh, and the remaining 100 000 Vietnamese refugees

 throughout the region, could be assisted by a greater regional involvement.

 We will also seek to encourage the Asia-Pacific region to wrestle with environment

 10

 issues and 

 to develop a regional perspective on the environment. We believe there is scope to work together to overcome the differences between developed and developing nations within the region on these issues.

 A Hewson Government will not ignore the problems or potential of other regions of the world. As outlined in Southern Africa: Opportunities and Challenges, Australia-South Asia: An Undeveloped Relationship, The New Central Asian States, and The

 Middle East Peace Conference - Reason For Cautious Hope, peace and stability is important in order to build secure economic relationships for growth and development.

 In particular, we place great importance on achieving security in the Middle East. The Gulf War demonstrated that conflict in the Middle East affects the whole world including Australia.

 A Coalition government will be supportive of the peace process between Israel and the Arab states. The Palestinian issue must be resolved in a way which is just and which contributes to a more stable and secure Middle East. Israel's right to exist in peace within safe and internationally recognised borders must be secured as part of any settlement.

 Global Action

 The third priority in our approach to foreign policy will be participation in global multilateral forums.

 Whilst our priorities - in contrast to Labor - concentrate on bilateral challenges and then regional responsibility, there is still an important place for the use of multilateralism to achieve Australia's interests.

 While a re-allocation of resources will occur to reflect this priority, it will not detract from our interest in the GATT. The Coalition will maintain the expertise necessary to participate actively in the GATT negotiations. The GATT remains a crucial part of multilateral efforts to preserve an open international trading order. A positive outcome to the GATT negotiations is very important to Australia's interests, especially in agriculture and services.

 The Liberal/National Coalition Nations. We believe that credit where Australia contributed to country.

 welcomes the reinvigorated role of the United is due for its successes - for example in Namibia, an effective outcome for the people of that new

 As outlined in Changing Global Relationships: Room For United Nations Action, the Coalition believes that there is scope for greater United Nations attention to crises within states. We are supportive of the United Nations attempts to move from strictly peacekeeping and election monitoring functions, to assuming greater responsibility for the administration and reconstruction of states in crisis. However, we do recognise that there are risks in this process which will need to be monitored

 carefully.

 11

 Involvement in Cambodia, despite its difficulties, has been a valuable first for the

 United Nations and involvement in Somalia has taken this experience a step further. However, grave difficulties remain in imposing peace on nations which are not yet ready for peace, as is very apparent in the troubled states of the former Yugoslavia.

 The Coalition will support United Nations efforts in these areas, but is very conscious of the institutional changes needed to the United Nations, including the Security Council, to enable the UN to more effectively address the changing nature of the world's problems.

 The Coalition recognises that for world security, the problem of proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and missile proliferation, must be addressed. We are committed to continuing the work which is being carried out on a multilateral basis to contain and reduce the dangers of proliferation.

 Other global problems will require the attention of Australia and the international community. Mass movements of peoples, competing environmental and developmental priorities, and health issues such as HIV/AIDS and drugs, will require cooperation and resources for effective management.

 THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE

 The instrument which we will use to achieve our policy objectives will be the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).

 We will maintain a single Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. However, we believe there is a pressing need and considerable scope for the restructuring of the Department.

 We will increase resources devoted to Australia's trade and economic interests. We will develop and increase specialist skills in areas important to Australia's interests. There will be a particular emphasis on developing expertise in bilateral trade and economic relations, and specialisation in skills applicable to Asia.

 We will encourage a strong private sector input into DFAT. We will make DFAT reporting more focused towards sound and detailed analysis to achieve our strategic trade objectives. This will be assisted by private sector input and will be available to Australian enterprises.

 The Liberal/National Coalition will increase efficiency and reduce waste in DFAT through management improvements. We will streamline procedures and identify areas where resources could be better directed elsewhere.

 The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will need to better market Australia abroad. Awareness of what Australia has to offer is not well developed overseas. This can be assisted through better targeted cultural and education promotion and exchange programs.
