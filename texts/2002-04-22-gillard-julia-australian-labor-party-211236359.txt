 MEDIA RELEASE

 CURTIN DETENTION CENTRE VIOLENCE MUST END

 Criminal behaviour at the Curtin detention centre and particularly the violence that has resulted in staff being injured is to be condemned.

 Australian Federal Police will be investigating the incident.  The outcome of that investigation should be made public so it is clear what has happened and who is responsible.  Those who have committed criminal acts should be charged.

 Whatever grievances the asylum seekers held at the Curtin Detention Centre may have, violence is not the answer.  Asylum seekers should immediately surrender any weapons held and cease protest action.  The Howard Government should also be seeking a peaceful end to the disturbance.

 When the situation has returned to normal the Howard Government should ask the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, which resolved the Woomera crisis in January this year, to investigate the problems at the Curtin Detention Centre.  IDAG should also be asked to make recommendations on the best way to make arrangements for Curtin’s forthcoming closure.

 Children within the Curtin Detention Centre have been at risk of harm because of the violence.  Detention facilities such as Curtin are no place for children.  Labor has consistently called on the Howard Government to adopt Labor’s plan to get the children out from behind the razor wire and out of harm’s way.  Now is the time to act.  Unaccompanied children should be placed in appropriate foster care.  For accompanied children, the Howard Government should build on the successful alternate detention trial at Woomera where twenty-five women and children have been allowed to live under supervision in ordinary style housing.
