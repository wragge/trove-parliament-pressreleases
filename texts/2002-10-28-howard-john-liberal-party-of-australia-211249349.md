 MV TAMPA - SYDNEY MORNING HERALD REPORT

 The article in today's Sydney Morning Herald by reporter Marian Wilkinson alleges that on 29 August 2001 I misrepresented to the Parliament the medical situation on board MV Tampa by "failing to report an assessment by a military doctor that two asylum seekers on the ship were in urgent need of medical attention . . .".

 I reject the claim. The only misrepresentation that has occurred is by Ms Wilkinson.

 At all times safety of life at sea was a critical concern to the Government and to the Navy. The very files Ms Wilkinson refers to contain numerous written instructions issued during the border protection operations that safety of life at sea for Defence Force personnel, unauthorised arrivals and third parties alike, was a paramount requirement.

 In response to Ms Wilkinson's claims I have today been advised by the Australian Defence Force that following a review of its records and files;

 "The ADF provided medical care for all the Unauthorised Arrivals (UAs) from the Tampa both during the securing of the vessel on 28 August 01 and during the subsequent transfer of the UAs to Nauru in HMAS Manoora. All those suffering from dehydration (including the eight months pregnant woman) responded well to treatment. No medical evacuations were required. Treatment was also provided for other illnesses while enroute to Nauru. There were five pregnant women in the Tampa group. An obstetrician was embarked in Manoora on 13 Sep 01 to provide specialist medical support if required but no babies were born on this voyage. The UAs were all safely disembarked in Nauru over the period 19-27 Sept 01."

 My public statements at the time were carefully based on the advice I received from the Defence Forces.

 What I told the House on 29 August 2001 was that ". . . nobody - and I repeat: nobody - has presented as being in need of urgent medical assistance as would require their removal to the Australian mainland or to Christmas Island".

 I made it plain that that was the initial medical advice and that the assessment process was continuing.

 A copy of the House of Representatives Hansard of 29 August 2001 is attached as is the written advice received today from the Australian Defence Force.

 The truth of the matter is confirmed by the fact that once the situation on MV Tampa had been stabilised and a proper medical assessment made there was no need to evacuate anyone from the ship.

 Likewise other allegations in the article misrepresent the facts even where my office (on two hours notice shortly before my departure for APEC) provided detailed answers and references to documents to demonstrate the inaccuracy of her claims.
