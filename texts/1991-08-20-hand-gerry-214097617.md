 IMMIGRATION BUDGET STATEMENT 4

 IMMIGRATION CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS FURTHER ENHANCED

 The Government has announced a further increase in the  resources devoted to reducing the numbers of illegal  entrants in Australia.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, said allocations in the Budget would  allow:

 - the recruitment of a further 21 compliance field staff and  investigations officers; and

 - the provision of an expanded immigration holding centre in

 These measures are in addition to the establishment of a  processing centre for unauthorised boat arrivals at Port  Hedland, as announced last week.

 Mr Hand said the additional compliance field officers would  boost the efforts of the present 150 who located 9253  illegal entrants in 1990-91 â€”  a massive increase over the  2896 locations the previous year.

 The extra investigations staff would strengthen the  Department's capacity to conduct inquiries into immigration  malpractice and fraud.

 The Minister said that increased compliance activity against  illegal entrants has placed a strain on existing detention  facilities.

 Accordingly it had been decided to convert an under-used  section of the Westbridge Migrant Centre at Villawood, Sydney, to provide temporary accommodation for people in  detention.

 "The renovated facility will operate in conjunction with the  existing Immigration Detention Centre at Villawood," Mr Hand  said.

 "It will be used primarily to accommodate detainees who pose  a lower risk of escape but who, for legal or operational  reasons, cannot be released into the community.

 "This will reduce the Department's need to make alternative  custody arrangements, often of a less than satisfactory  nature, whenever existing facilities are unable to cope."

 Mr Hand said funds for the new measures would be provided by  the introduction, on 1 October this year, of a visa  application fee of $20 to apply to all visitor visa  applicants except tourists.
