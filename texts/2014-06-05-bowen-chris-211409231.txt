 THE HON CHRIS BOWEN MP  SHADOW TREASURER  MEMBER FOR MCMAHON 

 E&OE TRANSCRIPT   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  PARLIAMENT HOUSE  THURSDAY, 5 JUNE 2014  SUBJECT/S: Tony Abbott’s Budget of broken promises; National Party  fuel tax con; Budget attack on rural Australia; Indonesia; asylum  seekers; foreign aid.  CHRIS BOWEN, SHADOW TREASURER: Well we knew that the Liberal Party  lied to the Australian people at the election, and now we know they lied to the  National Party at the Budget. The Australian people have woken up this morning  to see a Government scrambling and in damage control. I mean the Finance  Minister and the Agriculture Minister having to deny reports that were started by  senior Liberals. Senior Liberals boasting in this building, Parliament House, that  they tricked the National Party. Senior Liberal members of this Government  boasting that they’d lied and tricked, to members of their own Government. If  the National Party can’t trust the Liberal Party, how can the Australian people  ever trust the Liberal Party?   Now the National Party has been duped here. The National Party sat by and  watched this Budget decimate regional and rural Australia and has not uttered a  whimper. We’ve seen the National Party Minister for Education in New South  Wales talk about the impact on rural and regional schools, of the $80 billion cut  to schools and hospitals, not a word from Warren Truss. We’ve seen Campbell  Newman, the Liberal-National Party Premier of Queensland, complain about the  impact on pensioners. Not a word from the National Party in Canberra. They’re  lions in their country towns, and they’re mice when it comes to Parliament House  Canberra to argue with Tony Abbott.  Now, this is a fundamental matter of honesty. If the Australian people can see  that Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey tricked their National Party Coalition colleges,  then the Australian people have every right to expect, after an election campaign  based on deceit, that the Liberal Party just can’t be honest with them.   Happy to take some questions. Latika. 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Bowen, you’ve said if the Nats can’t trust the Liberals, why  should the Australian people, the Nationals Barnaby Joyce have just said they  emphatically trust the Liberals.   BOWEN: Well they would say that wouldn’t they? And they’re in damage control  scrambling to deny this story. Now as you know Latika, this story did not come  from the Labor Party, did not come from members of the press gallery. This was  senior Liberals boasting to members, senior members, respected members of the  press gallery, people who check their sources very thoroughly, that they had  tricked the National Party, taking credit for their chicanery.   That is something that the National Party has a right to be angry about, and they  should be angry about it, and they should be even angrier on behalf of the  people of rural and regional Australia and they should stand up, vote against the  increase in the fuel excise. They should stand up against the $80 billion cuts to  health and education. They should stand up against the cuts to family tax  benefit, which will have a very significant impact on single income families in  rural and regional Australia. They should actually do what they were created to  do and stand up for rural and regional Australia. The Labor Party will.   JOURNALIST: So you’re saying the Nationals are too trusting or naÃ¯ve or what?  BOWEN: Well the National Party is clearly a wholly owned subsidiary of the  Liberal Party. Warren Truss is no Jack McEwan. He doesn’t have it in him to  stand up to this city-centric Liberal Party. He doesn’t have it in him to stand up  for the people of rural and regional Australia, and the National Party is a pale  shadow of its former self.  JOURNALIST: Sounds like you’re close to gloating?  BOWEN: No, I’m pointing out that the Government this morning is in damage  control, scrambling to deny a story they started.   JOURNALIST: Can we talk about the Indonesia trip, I mean do you think Tony  Abbott and Julie Bishop are deserving of any credit for bettering relations with  Indonesia?  BOWEN: Well under this Government we’ve seen relations with Indonesia  plummet to new lows. Now obviously any action which saw Australia on a better  keel with Indonesia we would lend our support to, but there’s very significant  issues with the Australian-Indonesian relationship. It’s a very important one to  Australia. We would lend our support to any constructive measures to improve  that relationship which had been really threatened by a whole range of issues  including the Government’s immigration policy settings.   JOURNALIST: So you’re not convinced that Tony Abbott’s Jakarta trip will have  any effect?  BOWEN: Well look, if there is anything which improves the relationship with  Indonesia including a Prime Ministerial visit would have our support.   JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that Australia’s aid budget has been inflated  to cover the costs of resettlement in Cambodia?  BOWEN: Well on Cambodia, I mean what an act of hypocrisy, what an act of  hypocrisy. I mean a Liberal Party which raged against sending refugees and 

 asylum seekers to Malaysia, now apparently is going to send them to Cambodia.  A Treasurer who stood at the dispatch box and tearfully said “over my dead  body” will unaccompanied minors be sent to Malaysia, is a member of a  Government turning boats around with unaccompanied minors on it and is a  member of the Government seeking a deal with Cambodia.  Now, on the matter of how it’s paid for, we will wait to see the details and we  would expect a lot of details on this. We would expect to see a lot of the details  in relation to the Cambodia agreement, alleged agreement, apparent agreement  with Cambodia. What measures have been put in place and certainly any funding  measures, we would take a very close look at.   JOURNALIST: The aid budget has already been reduced, would it be fair to set  aside such a large amount for resettlement for refugees when Labor did that?  BOWEN: Well of course the aid budget has been reduced under this  Government. The attempt to reach the Millennium Development Goals was a  bipartisan policy in Australia, it is no longer. It is no longer, and that is a  backward step for Australia. Now we’ll have more to say about our aid policies  obviously closer to the next election but we are deeply concerned about these  cuts in foreign aid when the Australian people were told that reach the  Millennium Development Goals was a bipartisan policy.  JOURNALIST: So why is Sam Dastyari been so critical of this when you made  Australia the largest recipient of its own aid with PNG?  BOWEN: Well Senator Dastyari is correctly pointing out that when you cut the  aid budget, and then when you apparently make agreements with Cambodia, we  don’t yet know how much it will cost or what the arrangements are, then you are  squeezing an already cut aid budget further. We increased the aid budget, we  increased our foreign overseas development assistance and this Government has  cut it.  JOURNALIST: Are you worried about the impact of the Government’s dole  changes and the fact that they’ve allocated emergency money for kicking people  out into the streets?  BOWEN: This Government is completely out of touch with the impact of their  own decisions and they are at extreme danger of creating an underclass in  Australia. I mean what will people live on if they’re under 30 and unemployed?  Will they go to their family, who may be aged pensioners for example? Will they  go to already overstretched charities?   This is unconscionable. This is unconscionable and we will not stand for it. We  will oppose the changes to Newstart. We will oppose them in the House of  Representatives, we will oppose them in the Senate and we will oppose them in  the community and we will not stand for it. And yes, we are concerned about the  impact on charities, on emergency funding, and on people’s daily ability to make  ends meet if they happen to have difficulty finding a job for a period and they  happen to be under 30.   JOURNALIST: Has Labor come to a final decision yet on what changes they’ll  support for family tax benefit part B? 

 BOWEN: We will oppose the change for over 6s, we will oppose, as Jenny  Macklin has correctly announced and has corrected an erroneous media report,  some of the changes to the rates freezing.   We are still working through the detail of the other changes, we’ll be as  constructive as we can in some elements of it, but we’ve made clear what our  values lead us to in terms of the things we’ve made clear decisions to oppose.   JOURNALIST: That includes the $100,000 threshold?  BOWEN: We’re still looking at that. Thanks.  ENDS  MEDIA CONTACT: JAMES CULLEN 0409 719 879
