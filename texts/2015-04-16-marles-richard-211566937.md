 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 ABBOTT GOVERNMENT’S DEAL WITH CAMBODIA STILL A MYSTERY    

 Today’s media reports regarding refugees on Nauru being transferred to  Cambodia as early as next week are just another example of the Abbott  Government’s contempt for the Australian community when it comes to asylum  seeker policy.     

 Yet again, we are hearing details of the Government’s plans for these vulnerable  people via media sources and other third parties.    

 Minister Dutton must come clean about the details of his discussions with  Cambodia and assure the Australian community that any refugees being  resettled in Cambodia are doing so voluntarily.    

 The Minister also needs to confirm that any refugee transferred to Cambodia will  be treated in a manner that respects their human rights and that appropriate  resettlement services will be provided for as long as necessary.
