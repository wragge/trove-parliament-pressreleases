 The Opposition has again called upon the Minister for Immigration to counter the  growing problem o f illegal migrants entering the job market.

 The Opposition has made several suggestions in this regard.

 - Requirement to cite legal residency status before tax file numbers are  issued.

 - Imposing penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal entrants.

 These two measures would deter the flow of illegals to Australia by removing the  incentive o f job availability and access to welfare benefits. It would also allow employers  to have the confidence that their em ployees are properly authorised to work.

 The Australian community is quite justifiably concerned about the severity o f this  situation.

 The costs o f locating and deporting illegal entrants is enormous. Last year it was  estimated that the cost to the Australian taxpayer was some $45 million. Even so, many  exercised their right to extend their stay in Australia by making claims for refugee status.

 There are a large number o f illegal entrants in Australia, presently estimated at around  80,000, but possibly significantly higher.

 The presence o f a large number of uninvited, queue jumpers, does enormous harm to  the integrity o f the immigration program because it circumvents the provisions o f health  criteria, criminal checking, skills and language testing, and the whole range o f criteria  legal migrants are expected to satisfy.

 On that basis alone, it is not unreasonable to conclude that they are people who would  be unacceptable as migrants to Australia.

 In the light o this enormous and significant problem, it is surprising that the Minister is  only tinkering around the edges. Information kits, while helpful to employers in  identifying illegals, do not address the fundamental problem.

 The Coalition urges the Government to take the further steps necessary to address this  problem, and adopt the above proposals as soon as practicable.
