 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: June 7 2005 

 

 TITLE: Doorstop Chennai India - Chen Yonglin   

 

 ABC: The ball seems back in your court that it is the duty of the Foreign Minister, or the  responsibility of the Foreign Minister, to decide on the territorial asylum for Chen Yonglin.  How would you consider this request?   

 Minister: Well, Mr Chen has applied for a protection visa and that is being considered by the  Immigration Department. And look obviously in the process of these applications, the  traditional factors are considered, factors relating to circumstances in Australia - capacity to  return home without persecution, and we should allow that due process to be followed  through. That is the way it’s being handled - I think that’s the responsible way for it to be  handled. I don’t think people should get excited about it, I think they should just allow the due  process to follow its course.   

 ABC: So you won’t be intervening but you have the power to do so apparently?   

 Minister: Ministers may have powers to do things but Ministers should also follow due  process. And I think in this particular circumstance, as in all circumstances, it’s very  important that proper process is followed. If we don’t follow proper process then we are going  to create all sorts of unfortunate and difficult precedence for ourselves as a country, and so as  a country, Australians, we should always follow due process.     

 ABC: This sort of political asylum, or territorial asylum, was originally applied on May 26.  Why was it refused then?   

 Minister: Well, look there have been only been two cases as far as I know in Australian  history where asylum of that kind - political asylum - has been given -  in the Petrov case,  and I think there was one other case, a very long time ago. Again I think the process that is  being followed here is the more right and more responsible process - it’s a more sophisticated  process. And I do not want to talk about the merits or demerits of this particular case because  to get into any discussion about those issues is to cut across the current application process for  protection visa. It is a very good rule of thumb for somebody who has applied for a protection  visa not to talk about their circumstances in public and for others not to discuss them either.  And bearing all that in mind I think it is much wiser that we stick to the application process

 that is there -- the due process is being followed and I am sure that an appropriate outcome  which will reflect the justice of this case will be found by the Immigration Department.   

 ABC: But in essence, is there any difference between this case and the Petrov case?   

 Minister: It’s a great question… I think I should basically take a cautious view here and say  that the facts of this case will be considered by the Immigration Department. We are not going  to be canvassing the facts of this case publicly. Suffice it to say that the facts are very  different from the facts in the Petrov case.   But that’s by the by. That doesn’t make any  contribution as an issue to whether this application for a protection visa will be accepted or  rejected. Whipping up controversy about this is not going to make a contribution one way or 

 another to this application. The application just has to be considered on its merits, on the facts  of the case.    

 ABC: It seems that the Immigration Minister, Amanda Vanstone, said that it is now your  responsibility, and not hers?   

 Minister: No, she has not. She has made it perfectly clear that there is an application for a  protection visa and that it is being considered. That’s much the more appropriate way to  handle this ... I think she fully accepts that.    

 ABC: And that’s (inaudible) as opposed to or is it in conjunction with this application for  territorial asylum?    

 Minister: We are looking at the application that has been made. Mr Chen made an application  for a protection visa. If he didn’t want to make an application for a protection visa,  presumably wouldn’t have done so. He has made the application … the application is being  considered. I don’t think getting into other issues is right when that application is being  considered. And people trying to pump me for information about Mr Chen’s case  won’t  be  successful because all of the information that I know and others know about Mr Chen is  information that are being considered in the context of this application for a protection visa.  That’s by far the best way and the most responsible way to handle this.   

 ABC: Thank you.
