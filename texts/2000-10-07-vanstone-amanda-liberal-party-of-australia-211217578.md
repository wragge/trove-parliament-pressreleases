 Boat people detected near Ashmore Islands Customs Coastwatch has detected and arranged interception of a vessel believed to be carrying at least 90 boat people, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 The vessel, believed to be a former inter-island ferry used in Indonesia, was detected late yesterday near Ashmore Islands by a Coastwatch Dash-8 surveillance flight, acting on information provided by a RAAF P3C Orion.

 The Customs vessel Wauri, which is on long-term patrol in the area, was tasked to intercept the vessel, and is currently towing it to Ashmore Islands. HMAS Dubbo is on standby to assist if necessary.

 The boat people, mostly of Middle Eastern origin, are expected to arrive at Ashmore Islands later today, and arrangements will then be made for the peopleÃ­s transfer to the mainland where they will be handed to officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

 Senator Vanstone said the detection indicated the continued success of the Coastwatch surveillance program.

 "Despite the fact that Ashmore Islands are about 500km from the mainland, the Coastwatch civil maritime surveillance program has continued to achieve success in detecting vessels off north-western Australia," Senator Vanstone said.

 "This latest vessel is the ninth carrying boat people to enter Australia since July, and all have been detected by Coastwatch before reaching the mainland."
