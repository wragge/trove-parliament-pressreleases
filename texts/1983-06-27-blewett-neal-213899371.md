 GRANTS TO N.S.W. HEALTH RESEARCHERS INCLUDE FUNDS TO 

 EVALUATE SYDNEY 'QUIT FOR LIFE' CAMPAIGN

 The Australian Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, 

 announced today a Health Services Research and Development Grant 

 towards the cost of evaluating the success of the 'Quit for 

 Life'  anti-smoking campaign recently promoted by the NSW 

 Government.

 Dr Blewett said the Commonwealth was particularly pleased 

 to be associated with this campaign which is based on the North 

 Coast Healthy Lifestyle campaign to which the Commonwealth made 

 a substantial contribution. This half million dollar campaign 

 would cost $165 500 bo evaluate with the Commonwealth contribu­

 ting $65 500.

 Dr Blewett said proper evaluation was important as he 

 saw national implications in any result. The campaign could be 

 used as a model for similar campaigns in other States if those 

 States wished to take up the challenge.

 Dr Blewett said another significant grant was the award 

 of $34 920 to Professor J. R. Glastonbury, energy consultant to 

 the NSW Hospital Planning Advisory Centre (HOSPLAN) to study 

 energy conservation in hospital laundries.

 The researchers would examine and review the optimum 

 washing water temperatures to ensure microbiological safety as 

 well as the correct use of detergents and the times of wash 

 cycle operation of laundry equipment.

 ,  Dr Blewett added that preliminary investigations revealed 

 that significant savings of at least $1 million per annum in 

 NSW alone could accrue from this study.

 Professor R. W. Gibberd, of the University of Newcastle,, 

 would receive a $23 900 grant. He would lead a team studying 

 the changes in the use of acute hospital inpatient facilities in 

 Sydney between 1978 and 1981.

 Dr Blewett said that in those four years there had been 

 significant changes in both the number and distribution of 

 hospital beds in Metropolitan Sydney, particularly following 

 the opening of the Westmead Centre.

 He added that it was important to measure changes in use 

 patterns to update planning guidelines which were valuable when 

 considering expansion or relocation of health services in urban 

 settings.

 Professor Peter Farrell, of the University of NSW, was 

 awarded a further grant of $45 300 to continue the examination 

 and prevention of complications in continuous ambulatory 

 peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). ,

 Dr Blewett said that CAPD was one of the newer advanced 

 technologies which offered renal replacement therapy which was 

 considered to be as good or better than the conventional 

 haemodialysis and intermittent peritoneal dialysis.

 However, the full benefits of CAPD could not be realised 

 without a significant reduction in the incidence of peritonitis 

 and the study was looking closely at this problem.

 Dr Andrea Mant, of the Royal Australian College of General 

 Practitioners (RACGP) was awarded a grant of $18 045 to study 

 the extent and nature of long-term prescribing and use of 

 psychotropic drugs.

 Dr Blewett said the study aimed to improve patient care .  

 through a better understanding of prescribing patterns of 

 psychotropic drugs as well as the development of a data base of 

 information from which guidelines for prescribing psychotropic 

 drugs could be developed for medical education by the RACGP.

 Dr R. A. Osborn, of the Royal Hospital for Women, would 

 receive a seed grant of $10 000 to develop a protocol for research 

 into the reasons for a failure of the early detection program 

 of cervical cancer. '

 Dr Blewett said it had been brought to his attention that, 

 despite the availability since 1962 of cervical cytological 

 testing for early detection of cancer of the cervix, the incidence 

 of this cancer had not fallen in the period 1972-77, nor had 

 mortality rates fallen. A study of this type would attempt to 

 bring new light on the subject and illustrate where the present 

 problems lay. â 

 The awards were among grants totalling $408 952 which 

 have been awarded to researchers in three States and the Austra­

 lian Capital Territory.
