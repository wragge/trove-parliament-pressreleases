 AUSTRALIAN GREENS MEDIA RELEASE   

 Menadue right again over double standards on asylum seekers   arriving by plane: Greens   

 Former Immigration Department Secretary, John Menadue, is again correct when he  says more people seek asylum at Australiaâs airports than those who arrive by boat, the  Australian Greens said today.   

 “The Immigration Departmentâs 2010-11 annual report (page 119) shows 6,316 people  sought asylum at our airports, compared to 5,175 people who arrived by boat,” Greensâ  immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said.    

 “Greater numbers sought protection at airports in 2009-10 and also 2008-09.    

 “Around 90 percent of people who arrive by boat are found to be in genuine need of  protection. That falls to less than 40 percent of those who arrive by plane.    

 “You never hear the Coalition bleat âstop the planesâ.   

 “People seeking asylum is a humanitarian issue and requires a more thoughtful and  commonsense approach, rather than scoring political points over peoplesâ desperation.   

 “As Mr Menadue asks, why are people who seek our protection via a boat are  demonised and treated differently than if they arrive via a jet? The Refugee Convention  says those seeking asylum should not be punished based on their mode of arrival. This  is a double standard which must be stopped. Other countries do not treat asylum  seekers differently based on how they arrive.   

 “The Greens note the harshly worded joint statement from Ministers Bowen and Clare  issued yesterday suggesting Labor remains locked in a race to the bottom with Tony  Abbott to dump asylum seekers offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.   

 “We urge Labor to show some moral backbone and stop its plans to reinstate offshore  assessments outside of Australia. The Greens will never vote in favour of any legislation  to exporting our humanity to Nauru or anywhere else.”
