 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the on-water



 reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



 The reporting period is from 1 July 2017 to 31 July 2017.



 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration authorities.



 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres.



 Nine illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. One illegal maritime arrival detainee



 was involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin. Their removal from Australia is consistent with



 Australia's obligations.



 Seven illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



 country.



 As at 31 July 2017, there was a total of 791 people in Manus Island RPC and 371 people in Nauru RPC. With the



 opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on those



 still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



 Of the 1,025 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 515 were positive and 510 were



 negative as at 31 July 2017. There were 730 refugees who have been given a positive final determination. There



 were 253 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



 Of the 1,210 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 1,053 were positive and 157 were



 negative as at 31 July 2017.
