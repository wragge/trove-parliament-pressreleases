 AUSTRALIAN GREENS MEDIA RELEASE   

 13 September 2012   

 Government won’t say to Australian public or Nauru government what force will be used to  deport refugees   

 Amidst reports that the first plane load of refugees will leave for Nauru later today, the  Government has refused to explain its use of force protocols for executing the transfers and  appears to have disregarded the Nauru government’s specific condition that force not be used  against refugees.   

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young requested information about use of force in the Senate question  time today from Minister Lundy.   

 “The Government reiterated today that it fully intends to use force that is ‘necessary and  reasonable’ despite the Nauru foreign minister having specifically requested that no force be  used in transfers’ said Greens immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young today.   

 “I would like to know what the Government deems ‘necessary and reasonable’ force to use on  children and pregnant women who desperately do not want to be indefintely dumped in  inadequate conditions in Nauru?      

 “I gave the Minister three opportunities to clarify whether ‘necessary and reasonable’ includes  use of weaponry and restraints against refugees but I received no satisfactory answer.   

 “The Nauru government and the Australian people have a right to know what force will be used  against refugees and their children and the Government cannot justify dodging the question.
