 RUDD WRONG ON RESCUE BRIEFING   

 Yesterday evening in an interview with Paul Bongiorno, Kevin Rudd misleadingly  stated that the Australian Labor Party had not been briefed on the circumstances of the  rescue of 16 people by the Royal Australian Navy off the northwest coast of Australia  late on Tuesday, 20 November 2007.   

 BONGIORNO: 

 

 Well Mr Rudd the Navy has apprehended 16 boat people, 10 of them children. They’re  currently on Christmas Island. What would a Rudd government do with these people?   

 RUDD: 

 

 Well Paul we’ve been checking with the department today and we still haven’t been briefed on  their factual circumstances, where they were precisely interdicted, what was the state of the  vessel, have they made any particular claims of the Australian Government or were they  simply in distress.    

 (Ten News, 21 November 2007)   

 Mr Rudd’s Defence spokesperson, Mr Fitzgibbon, was provided with a full and  detailed briefing on the circumstances of the rescue by the Vice Chief of the Defence  Force Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie yesterday morning, Wednesday 21 November  2007.   

 Mr Fitzgibbon was provided with all of the information available to government at  that time.   

 The Opposition was first informed of the incident when Mr Rudd’s Chief of Staff, Mr  Epstein, was contacted by my office just after 2.00 am yesterday morning. Mr Epstein  was also provided with a copy of the media release that I issued shortly thereafter. 

 

 Mr Rudd’s response does not reflect this.
