 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 17 February 2014   

 Manus disturbance shows offshore failure   

 Regular reports of unrest and disturbance on Manus Island and Nauru show that offshore  processing is an expensive and serious policy failure from the Abbott Government, the  Australian Greens have said.   

 “The Manus Island detention centre has always been inhumane but it’s clear that, under the  Abbott Government, the situation there is at boiling point,” the Greens immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Immigration Minister must be up front with the Australian people and explain how his  government’s failures led to this disturbance.   

 “Manus Island and Nauru are putting individual people in serious danger, just like Tony Abbott’s  illegal tow-backs.   

 “Rather than spending billions of dollars locking up thousands of people in island detention  centres, the Australian Government should be leading a genuine regional solution as it did in the  wake of the Vietnam War.   

 “The reported disturbance is very concerning and I will be travelling to Manus Island in the  coming months to inspect the detention centre and to meet with refugees myself.   

 “How did the country of the fair go become the country that locks refugees up on remote Pacific  islands because they asked for protection?”
