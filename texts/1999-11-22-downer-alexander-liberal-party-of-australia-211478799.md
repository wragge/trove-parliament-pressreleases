  FURTHER AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE FOR THE PEOPLE 
OF EAST TIMOR

  

  

  I am pleased to announce that Australia will contribute an additional 
$60 million this financial year to a ssist East Timor’s humanitarian 
and reconstruction needs.

  

 The Australian Government remains deeply concerned 
about the serious situation facing the East Timorese people. Humanitarian 
agencies have identified huge needs for emergency relief in both East 
and West Timor and for reconstruction of East Timor.

  

 Every aspect of economy and society in East Timor 
has been affected by militia violence —70 percent of homes need to 
be rebuilt, health centres and schools need to be repaired, crops planted, 
public services restored, communities brought back to life.

  

 Together with the $14 million previously committed 
this is the largest ever contribution to an international humanitarian 
crisis by Australia.

  

 As a first step, $23 million will be provided through 
United Nations (UN) agencies to meet immediate humanitarian needs. This 
funding will provide for repatriation and resettlement. Materials will 
be provided to assist rebuild homes such as supplies of timber, roofing 
iron, nails and handtools. This is a priority given the onset of the 
wet season.

  

 Programs will be funded which address basic education 
and health needs such as child immunisation, malaria prevention, training 
of mid-wives and the re-establishment of schools.

  

 $3 million will also be provided for refugee and local 
communities in Indonesian West Timor. This will support emergency health, 
nutrition and water and sanitation programs in these communities.

  

 The remaining funds will be used to support longer 
term reconstruction and development programs and establish a simple 
administration under United Nations authority to oversee East Timor’s 
preparations for independence. Decisions on the allocation of these 
funds will be made after more detailed analysis of longer term reconstruction 
and development needs.
