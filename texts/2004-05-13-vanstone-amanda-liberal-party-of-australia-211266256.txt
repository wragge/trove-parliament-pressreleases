 No additional children to Baxter

 VPS 069/2004

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said the transfer of detainees from Port Headland to Baxter  Detention Facility would not mean more children at Baxter in Port Augusta.

 'The 52 detainees currently at Port Headland, all single males, will be transferred to Baxter over the next few months,' Senator Vanstone said.

 '$505,000 has been allocated in the 2004/05 Budget announced this week for minor works at Baxter.

 'The works do not involve any expansion of capacity.

 'The consolidation of detention facilities reflects the success of the Government's strategy to combat people smuggling.

 'Illegal arrivals have virtually ceased, allowing the Government to consolidate facilities by closing Port Headland and Curtin and upgrading centres  at Baxter, Villawood and Maribyrnong.

 'The Port Headland facility will be maintained to allow it to be recommissioned should extra capacity be required in the future.'
