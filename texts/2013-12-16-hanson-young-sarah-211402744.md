 Behaviour protocols for refugees, Liberal Party  fear mongering: Greens    

 The Australian Greens have labelled the Immigration Minister’s Code of Behaviour for refugees on  bridging visas a distasteful political stunt and will move to disallow the legislative instrument that  underpins it.    

 “This is a move straight from the Liberal Party handbook on fear mongering and hysteria,” the  Greens’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “We have behaviour protocols, they’re called Australian law and they should apply to everyone  equally.    

 “This is clear discrimination against a specific group of people and it needs to be called out for what  it is.    

 “Having one set of rules for some people and a different set of rules for others offends the very  ideals of a fair and decent democratic society.    

 “The Greens will move to disallow this legislative instrument at the first opportunity.    

 “It is regrettable that we have a government in Australia that is more interested in vilifying refugees  who are fleeing from war and persecution than giving them the safety that they need.”
