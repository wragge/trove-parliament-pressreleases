 Stephen Smith MP  Shadow Minister for Immigration  Member for Perth

 PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - STATE PARLIAMENT  HOUSE, PERTH, SUNDAY, 20 JULY 2004   

 SUBJECT: STATEMENT ON 2004 WORLD REFUGEE DAY   

 SMITH: Firstly, I’d like to pay my respects to Jim Bacon and give my best wishes  to his family.  It is a great loss to the Party and great loss to Tasmania.   

 Today is World Refugee Day and I’d like to acknowledge the fine work done by the  UNHCR across the world so far as refugees are concerned.  I also want to acknowledge  Australia’s contribution through our offshore refugee program which has been very  successful over the years and is generally under appreciated by Australians.   

 The Government could mark World Refugee Day in the most significant way it could  mark World Refugee Day, and that’s by standing up and announcing a policy change on  children in detention.  We have been absolutely committed to removing children from  immigration detention centres since 2002 and that would be the most appropriate way the 

 Government could mark World Refugee Day.   

 Minister Vanstone was on national television this morning and there a few issues worth  commenting on so far as her performance this morning was concerned.   

 Firstly on the Nauru hunger strike and the 7 Iraqis on hunger strike.  I continue to  underline the point that the Government needs to ensure that appropriate and adequate  medical resources and facilities are made available.  They need to make sure they have  learned the lesson from earlier in the year.   

 Secondly, I welcome the fact that more Afghans have been processed on the basis of  changed circumstances in Afghanistan.  These people will be resettled in Australia,  giving a lie to the Government’s 2001 election mantra chant not one of these people  would set foot on Australia.   

 

 I also welcome the Minister’s belated action in indicating she is proposing to ask the  UNHCR about changed circumstances in Iraq, so that the 56 Iraqis on Nauru can be  reconsidered.   

 The Minister was also asked about the Audit Office report which was published late in  the day on Friday.  This is a serious condemnation of the Government’s privatisation of  immigration detention centre management and it’s a comprehensive indictment of the  Government’s policy and DIMIA’s administration of it.  It underlines the fact that  Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory should be responsible for the  management of immigration detention centres. 

 

 This is a stark contrast between Labor and the Government.  Labor believes that  immigration detention centres should be managed by Commonwealth officers and not  privatised or outsourced to international companies or foreign countries.  The ACM  contract has been worth over $470 million and that shows the extraordinary amount of 

 funds involved in the Government’s administration of this area.    

 That of course leads me to the Pacific Solution, where we have the debacle of Manus  Island being open at least until October, and the Minister hinting that it may continue, at a  cost of $250,000 a month and looking after no one.   

 So far as the Pacific Solution generally is concerned, it has already cost us over $200  million.  The Budget papers indicate another $85 million in the next financial year with  anywhere up to $300 million in the forward estimates.  These are extraordinary allocation  of funds.  The Government should end the Pacific Solution tomorrow.  It’s not required,  it’s not needed as a deterrent.     

 If you follow the Minister’s argument that offshore processing is a deterrent, she  mentions Nauru, Manus Island and Christmas Island: Nauru and Manus Island could be  closed and the facility left open on Christmas Island.  If you believe the Minister that it is  a deterrent, Christmas Island would have the same effect.   

 The Government could mark World Refugee Day by changing it’s policy on children in  detention, by the changing of the privatisation arrangements of the management of  immigration detention centres and return that to Commonwealth officers, and end the  Pacific Solution so that our immigration detention centres are managed by 

 Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory.
