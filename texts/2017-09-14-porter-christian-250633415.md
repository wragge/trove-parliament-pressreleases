 Government Strengthens No Jab, No Pay requirements   

 The Turnbull Government is taking action to encourage even more parents to meet  immunisation requirements for their children.   

 Under legislation being introduced today, parents’ fortnightly Family Tax Benefit Part A  payments will be reduced by about $28 per fortnight for each child who does not meet the  immunisation requirements.   

 From 1 July 2018, this will replace the current system under which end-of-year supplements  are withheld for children whose immunisation is not up to date.   

 Reducing fortnightly payments, rather than withholding the supplement at the end of the year  as occurs at present, will serve as an ongoing and immediate incentive for parents to get their  children immunised and will help ensure that more children and the wider community will be  protected from preventable diseases like whooping cough.   

 No Jab, No Pay has been an outstanding success, boosting immunisation rates since it was  introduced at the beginning of 2016.   

 About 210,000 families have taken action to meet immunisation requirements since No Jab, No  Pay commenced.   

 Since 1 January 2016, rates of fully immunised children have increased since the introduction  of No Jab, No Pay in January 2016, to 93.79 per cent of children aged between 12-15 months;  90.86 per cent of children aged between 24-27 months; and 93.55 per cent of children aged  five years. Indigenous immunisation rates amongst five year old have also increased over that  time and are now at 95.7 per cent.   

 Encouraging as these rates are, immunisation coverage for all children falls short of the 95 per  cent minimum herd immunity required to slow or stop the spread of disease.   

 Taken over a whole year, the $28 per fortnight is approximately the same value as the current  end-of-year supplement ($737), so there is no change to the amount deducted.   

 By reducing fortnightly payments, rather than withholding the supplement at the end of the  year, parents will have an immediate incentive to have their children immunised.   

 The more immediate the financial impact, the more likely children will be vaccinated within  optimum timeframes to ensure the most effective coverage against disease.  …/2

 This change also means that parents earning over $80,000 in adjustable taxable income have  the same incentive to immunise their children.  These families no longer qualify for the FTB  Part A supplement, which is paid after the financial year, so now don’t experience any payment  reduction if they haven’t immunised their children.  The new measure will ensure that all FTB  families, irrespective of income, are treated the same.   

 Catch-up vaccinations are also available for young people up to the age of 19 who would like to  complete their childhood vaccinations, and for refugees and humanitarian entrants of any age.   

 The Government has also provided $5.5 million over three years for a childhood immunisation  education campaign to encourage Australian parents and carers to get their children  vaccinated.   

 More information about No Jab, No Pay immunisation requirements, is available on the  Department of Human Services website.   

 Under the No Jab, No Pay policy, children must be fully immunised, have a valid exemption or  be on a valid catch-up schedule if parents are to continue receiving child care payments, and  with the new No Jab, No Pay measure, their full Family Tax Benefit Part A fortnightly payment.   

 Key figures   As at 30 June 2017 there were approximately 2,816,000 children with a No Jab, No Pay  immunisation requirement whose families have had their FTB payments reconciled for 2015-16.  Of these: 

 ï· the full FTB Part A supplement entitlement has been paid to families for approximately  2,679,000 children who met immunisation requirements (95.1%);   ï· families responsible for approximately 137,000 children lost all or some of their  supplement because they did not meet the full year immunisation requirements.

 * Note: From March 2017, the definition of ‘fully Immunised’ has changed resulting in the  addition of a dose 4 DTP (given at 18 months) being included in the assessment. The  inclusion of these immunisations to the coverage calculation in March 2017 has caused a  drop in the 24-27 month coverage rates.  The more antigens included in the assessment,  the higher the likelihood of reduced coverage rates. This usually resolves over time as the  changes become more routine.
