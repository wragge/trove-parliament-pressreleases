 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FIVE BOAT ARRIVALS AND 209 PEOPLE IN  JUST 24 HOURS UNDER LABOR February 18, 2013

 This latest boat arrival, carrying 86 passengers, was intercepted three days ago despite only being reported by the  Minister for Home Affairs tonight, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.   

 “The five illegal boat arrivals that have been reported on in the last 24 hours were in fact all intercepted last Friday and  Saturday - yet the Australian people are only being informed of it now as Labor tries to hide the fact that 5 illegal boats,  carrying a total of 209 people, arrived in just 24 hours under their watch.

 “Once again Labor is waiting to release the details of boat arrivals in order to avoid scrutiny of its border protection  failures.

 “Already this month has seen the most boats and the largest amount of people arrive ever in February, despite only being  half way through the month. 

 “Almost 1200 people on more than 20 boats have arrived in the first 6 weeks of 2013 as this year shapes up to be another  record breaking year for illegal arrivals under the Gillard Labor Government.

 “Labor’s abysmal track record on border protection has left no confidence that they will ever be able to stop the boats  from coming.

 “The Coalition will restore policies such as temporary protection visas and turning the boats back around when it is safe to do so, in order to put an end to this insidious trade that prays on people’s vulnerabilities,” Mr Keenan said.
