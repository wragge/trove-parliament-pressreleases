 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 12 Feb 2001 Press Release Number: 01/77 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Hanson ‘lamentably ignorant’ on refugees Starting with her maiden speech in Parliament through to her most recent comments on refugees, Pauline Hanson has consistently demonstrated a lamentable ignorance of the facts regarding immigration, according to Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

 Senator Bartlett said he was horrified that Ms Hanson was repeating calls to “turn the boats around and say go back where they come from.”

 “This would be a de facto death sentence for families, including children, who have escaped from murderous dictatorships like Iraq. Ms Hanson’s views on this matter are un-Australian,” Senator Bartlett said.

 In comments today Ms Hanson said asylum seekers in detention centres were immigration ‘queue jumpers’ rather than genuine refugees.

 “The definition of a refugee is very clear and exact. Asylum seekers go through strict assessments before they are accepted as refugees,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “It is not about how you got here, it is about what you escaped from and what would happen to you if you were returned.

 “The concept of there even being a queue to jump is ridiculous when you are escaping from a country that does not have an Australian Embassy.

 “Besides these people are not taking places away from other refugees. Last year, Australia did not even use all it’s 12,000 allocated places for refugees.

 “When Ms Hanson makes accusations like, “There's diseases that they're bringing into Australia,” she is whipping up hatred towards people who have escaped persecution.

 “It is not good enough for Ms Hanson to perpetuate ignorant urban myths. A

 political leader has an obligation to present the facts - not a half-baked amalgam of fear and nonsense.”
