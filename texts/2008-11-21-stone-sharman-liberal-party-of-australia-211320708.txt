 Christmas surge in illegal arrivals     

 A Federal Government announcement yesterday (Thursday) of just “two boat arrivals” prior to  the rescue of 12 people from an unseaworthy boat off Australia’s north-west is not accurate  and according to the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Dr Sharman Stone,  plays down three other intercepts by Indonesian authorities since August.    

 “There have been six known attempts by suspected people smugglers to breach Australia’s  borders since the Federal Government abolished the Temporary Protection Visa regime for  asylum seekers, then closed the Manus Island and Nauru detention centres,” Dr Stone says.     

 Those attempts include:   

 (1) Wednesday 13 August 2008 - Police in Indonesia arrest nine Afghan asylum seekers and  their Indonesian organiser on Flores island before they could flee to Australia by fishing boat;    

 (2) Tuesday 30 September 2008 - The Royal Australian Navy intercepts 14 people (12  passengers and two crew, including at least one woman) on a boat near the Ashmore Islands;    

 (3) Tuesday 7 October 2008 - A boat carrying 17 people is intercepted by the navy after it  arrived at an off-shore oil production and storage facility in the Timor Sea;   

 (4) Monday 20 October 2008 - Authorities in East Timor detain 16 Sri Lankans and four  Indonesians trying to make their way to Australia illegally by boat;    

 (5) Tuesday 11 November 2008 - Indonesian authorities find and detain 40 Iraqis, including  nine children, stranded on remote Sumbawa island during an attempt to reach Australia, and   

 (6) Wednesday 19 November 2008 - HMAS Ararat plucks 12 people from a sinking boat 80  nautical miles south east of Ashmore Island after they were spotted by a Coastwatch aircraft.    

 “I am concerned that the Government’s announced naval Christmas stand-down may mean  the next sinking boat will not be reached in time. With just two “response” vessels for the  whole of Australia, only one will be positioned on the nation’s west coast,” Dr Stone says.   

 “Minister Evans must now publicly, loudly and clearly articulate what Labor’s border security  policy is. He must try to convey that the Labor Government has not gone soft on people  smugglers.    

 “He must - for example - announce that the excised migration zones remain, that arrivals  claiming asylum face mandatory detention on Christmas Island until their identities and claims  can be verified and that anyone involved in people smuggling still risks prison terms of up to  20 years.”
