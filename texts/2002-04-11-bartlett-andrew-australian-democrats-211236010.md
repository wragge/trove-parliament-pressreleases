 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 11 April 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/165

 Need to close Woomera before Curtin The Australian Democrats have called on Minister Ruddock to mothball Woomera Detention Centre ahead of the Curtin Detention Centre.  

 Democrats' Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said “Many people, including the Minister's own advisory group, have recommended closing down Woomera. There is no reason for the Minister to delay this decision.”  

 “In addition, the Curtin facility is probably one of the few in Australia, which the local community is happy with and is wanting to stay open to bring resources into their town,” said Senator Bartlett.  

 “What is really needed is a move completely away from mandatory detention to a more community based approach.  

 “This would be less expensive, less traumatic and have no impact on the effectiveness of migration control measures,” said Senator Bartlett.  

 “The cost of establishing new centres at Port Augusta, Christmas Island and Brisbane is occurring only because of this Government's insistence on maintaining mandatory detention.   

 “The Minister’s admission this morning that he is unable to guarantee consistent, decent education for children in detention clearly shows-up the fragility of the Government’s policy.  

 “Australia should be able to provide the quality education to children in detention no matter what their nationality and background. We are a multicultural society and educating children from differing backgrounds is not a new challenge.  

 “There are highly successful schools, operating throughout Australia, which work to prepare children who are newly arrived refugees for the Australian school system,” said Senator Bartlett.  

 “One of the fundamental problems is that detention centres operate on the principal of isolation. The community is not encouraged to assist or participate in any way.  

 "The Minister's admission of failure in this area shows again the flawed and inhumane nature of mandatory detention, particularly in relation to children. Shuffling people around different detention centres is not going to address the fundamental problem, which is the detention centres themselves,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
