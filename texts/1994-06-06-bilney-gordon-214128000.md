 EXTRA ASSISTANCE FOR FORMER YUGOSLAVIA

 Australia is providing an extra $500,000 for international emergency relief efforts throughout the  former Yugoslavia, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 “Although the security situation in the former Yugoslavia is constantly changing there are some 

 hopeful signs for peace and improved conditions for effective relief and rehabilitation efforts,” Mr 

 Bilney said.

 “Australia is providing additional funding in response to the United Nations Revised Consolidated  Appeal for former Yugoslavia issued in May — an appeal aimed at meeting the relief needs of over  four million people.

 “Much of the additional Australian assistance is likely to benefit people in Bosnia-Herzegovina 

 where almost three million are currently dependent on international assistance,” Mr Bilney said.

 Mr Bilney made the announcement during a meeting with the Bosnian Foreign Minister, Dr Irfan 

 Ljubijankic, today.

 The Australian funds will be provided through the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), the lead agency in the international relief effort for the former Yugoslavia.

 It is expected that the Australian funds will be used to provide health care, food, shelter, domestic 

 items, and fuel for domestic use.

 Funds are being provided by AIDAB, Australia’s overseas aid agency.

 Australia has now provided $3.85 million for international relief efforts in the former Yugoslavia  since September 1991. Most of the assistance has been provided through multilateral agencies, such  as UNHCR, because of their capacity to provide effective, impartial assistance throughout the  former Yugoslavia.________________________________
