 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 16 September 2014   

 Refugee intake increase required now   

 The Australian Greens have said that they will push to have Australia’s refugee intake returned  to 20,000 places per year when Parliament returns in late September.   

 “Waging war while refusing to increase our refugee intake is grossly irresponsible,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The increasing humanitarian crisis in the Middle East demands a genuine, compassionate  response.   

 “When Parliament returns, the Greens will introduce a bill that would see Australia’s refugee  intake restored to 20,000 places a year. I urge Bill Shorten and the Labor Party to support this  move.   

 “By refusing to increase Australia’s refugee intake, Tony Abbott is exposing the faux-humanitarianism at the core of his mission in Iraq.   

 “The Abbott government’s decision to slash Australia’s refugee intake by a third after the  election was extremely short sighted.”
