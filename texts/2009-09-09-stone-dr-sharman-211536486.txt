 45 DAY RULE REMOVAL FURTHER SOFTENS BORDER PROTECTION 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP

 Joint Release  

 Last night the Labor Government succeeded in amending migration law to allow non-citizens in Australia to apply 

 for protection or refugee status at any time, and immediately gain work rights and access to Medicare.  

 Previously, unless there were special circumstances, you needed to apply for protection within 45 days of arrival 

 in Australia to gain work rights and access to Medicare while your case was being considered.  

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said the 45 day rule was introduced by the 

 Howard Government to avoid clogging up the system with vexatious claims.  

 “People with no real grounds for claiming protection could choose to make a claim after completing a course in 

 Australia for example, knowing that it can take a very long time to have the claim finally rejected,” Dr Stone said.  

 Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship who 

 introduced the disallowance in the Senate said, “The 45 day rule acted to discourage bogus claims. It was an 

 effective measure designed to discourage people travelling to Australia on legitimate visas, then deciding to claim 

 refugee status to remain in Australia, and then clogging up the system with prolonged and vexatious claims. "
