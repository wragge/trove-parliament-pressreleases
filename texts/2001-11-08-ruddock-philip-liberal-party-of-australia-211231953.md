 National Conference Addresses Refugee Settlement

 MPS 185/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock has told a national conference to discuss services for refugees arriving under Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program that no other country provides such a broad range of services for new arrivals.

 "The provision of settlement services to refugees and other humanitarian entrants is something of which we can all be justifiably proud," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Canberra conference coincided with the official launch of the new model of the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS), coordinated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

 It brought together over 30 contractors recently signed up under the IHSS, who will be focussing on improving the quality of services currently available to refugees while ensuring that services are consistent across all States and Territories.

 Services include help with initial orientation, accommodation support, early health intervention and torture and trauma counselling.

 "The IHSS is based on providing entrants with the information, skills and access to the services they need to make their own way along the settlement path so they can take back control of their lives as soon as possible," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Every year under the offshore Humanitarian Program, Australia welcomes thousands of refugees and those in humanitarian need.

 "Those who benefit from this important service get three to six months of intense orientation to assist them to independently find their way.

 "Adjusting to a new life in another country is often an exhausting and traumatic experience. This stress is often in addition to an already traumatic personal history.

 "They generally require a great deal of social support and friendship in their new environment.

 "Now they can access services to help them settle into the community and become independent members of the Australian society," Mr Ruddock said.

 The IHSS was originally established in 1997 to provide a national framework for a better-targeted and responsive approach to the settlement needs of humanitarian entrants.
