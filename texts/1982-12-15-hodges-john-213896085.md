 MIGRANT INTAKE TO FALL '

 Mr John Hodges, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, 

 said that a report in today's press that the Government  planned to bring in 143,000 migrants a year was completely  misleading.

 The article had taken outdated figures and presented them 

 as if they were still current,  " he said.

 It also failed to distinguish clearly between people who ·  

 will enter the workforce and dependents who will not be 

 looking for jobs."

 Furthermore, Mr Hodges said the statement attributed to  an immigration officer that the numbers of brothers and sisters cominc 

 here will be "almost uncontrollable" because of the "immense 

 pressure" from ethnic groups is absolute nonsense, .  â 

 "I want, therefore, to quite categorically deny inaccurate  and alarmist reports of increases in the migration program.

 In.fact, there has been· a tightening in the light of economic  conditions. There has not been,  nor will there b e , panic 

 reactions based~on ill-formed speculation."

 "Only yesterday I stated the program for this financial 

 year would be reduced by at least 15,000.people, down from 

 a projected 129,000-134,000 to less than 114,000, yet .  

 your journalist saw fit to ignore this fact. .

 "At no stage did the journalist contact me or my office 

 for a comment or to check whether the figures were correct 

 or updated," Mr Hodges said.

 Mr Hodges said that adjustments in the immigration program «  

 in response to labour market trends would produce the fall.

 Mr Hodges said action taken to adjust the program this year 

 included:

 . reduced priority for applicants.with occupations in demand; . stricter requirements (announced 11 December, 1982) for 

 training or recruiting Australian residents before  employers could lodge nominations for overseas 

 workers; ·

 . tighter checks on the ability of sponsors to support  family migration applicants;

 . validity of migrant entry visas reduced from 12 to 6 months;

 . tightening of the Working Holiday-makers Scheme.

 Mr Hodges stressed that these measures were supported by vigorous 

 action against illegal workers and tighter controls on temporary 

 entrants including visitors and dependents. P

 Mr Hodges pointed out that while the immigration program 

 had to remain flexible it was important that it served long­

 term interests rather than be viewed, simply for short-term  economic and political considerations.

 "The strong compassionate and humanitarian reasons for  our refugee and family migration programs cannot be cast  aside," Mr Hodges said.

 "I stress that of the total -migrant intake, fewer than 45,000  new arrivals will be seeking to enter the workforce and many 

 of those will be going to jobs guaranteed .by— Australian sponsors, 

 or to positions where there is a demand for. their skills."

 "The Government is closely monitoring the situation and action will 

 be taken where, necessary to .ensure the appropriate ..balance between 

 short-term and long-term requirements," Mr Hodges said, in conclusion
