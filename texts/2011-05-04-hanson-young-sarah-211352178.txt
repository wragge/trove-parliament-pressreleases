 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Time for major parties to free children from  detention: Greens   

 The Australian Greens have urged the Gillard government clearly and unequivocally state what  happens to all asylum seeker children in detention centres after June 30. The call by the Greens  spokesperson for immigration, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, comes after new figures from the  Immigration Department show 1,071 children were in detention centres as of May 1. 

 “As of April 27, only 368 children had been released, making me sceptical that the government will  fulfil a promise made in October to release by June 2011 ‘several hundred’ asylum seekers who are  children and their families,” Sen. Hanson-Young said. 

 “Despite popular perception, Immigration Minister Chris Bowen has never committed to removing all  children from detention after June 30. The government’s announcement last year was never to fix the  problem long-term, only deal with most of those children who were held as of late October, 2010.  

  “The Immigration Minister has since 2005 had the discretion to release children into the community  while their applications are assessed - yet this rarely occurs. All sides of politics say they believe  children shouldn’t be subject to detention, a view held by everyday Australians. But the current law  doesn’t reflect this.  

 “It’s time that the law protected children, and that, like in other countries such as Spain, Canada and  New Zealand, children are exempt from detention. 

 “My private senator’s bill (Migration Amendment Detention of Minors Bill 2010) currently before  parliament would ensure every child is put into the care of the community, and amend the Migration  Act to remove the presumption of mandatory detention for asylum seekers under 18. 

 “I have also tabled a bill to create a Commonwealth Commissioner for Children and Young People,  whose responsibilities would include the care and protection of our most vulnerable and  disadvantaged children. The Commissioner’s power would cover young nonâcitizens without  guardians who arrive in Australia without the protections given to those with visas or other authority  to enter Australia. 

 “We know the implications for the mental health, growth and overall well-being of children in  detention centres - a practice which has been condemned within Australia and also overseas by  human rights groups and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 

 “It’s shameful that in a wealthy country which prides itself on the principles of justice and a fair go, 

 more than 1,000 children are kept under lock and key in Australian detention facilities.”Media
