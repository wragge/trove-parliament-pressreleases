 REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL APPOINTMENTS

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock today  announced the reappointment of 18 members of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 "Eleven are re-appointed as full-time members, while the remainder will be part-time  members of the Tribunal. The reappointments take effect for periods from 15  September until 31 March 1997," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This is an interim arrangement to ensure that the work of the Tribunal is able to  continue while the Government considers the report from the Committee undertaking  the Review of Immigration Decision Making."

 "In its Immigration Policy statement, the Coalition made a commitment to review  immigration decision making, with particular attention to the membership, role and  performance of the Immigration and Refugee Review Tribunals," Mr Ruddock said.

 'The Review was established shortly after the Election and the report will be  presented to me at the end of September."

 Mr Ruddock said the Review had been advertised nationally, and well over a  hundred submissions had been received from individuals, community organisations,  immigration decision makers and international organisations.
