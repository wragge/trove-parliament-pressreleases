 The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 

 28 June 2009  MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release 

 More proof of Labor’s soft border protection policies  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs, Sussan Ley, said todayâs unauthorised boat arrival -  which has brought the total asylum seekers to arrive on our shores since the Rudd Government  softened border protection policies to more than 900 - is proof that Labor is sending the wrong  message to people smugglers. 

 The boat arrival, with almost 200 people on board, will seriously stretch the resources and capacity  of border protection even further after $58.1 million was cut from the Customs budget by Kevin  Rudd and Labor. 

 Ms Ley said the Government did not appear to have a plan and was acting reactively by employing  surveillance to spot the boats, and sending the Navy to intercept them, then making an  announcement about how well border protection was working. 

 “The cost of this exercise is astronomical, running into hundreds of thousands of dollars a day,” Ms  Ley said. 

 “The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is severely stretched, with so many  resources devoted to this one pocket of ocean near Christmas Island.” 

 In April, the Opposition called for an independent inquiry to examine any intelligence reports  provided by the Australian Federal Police, the impact of the Government's policies on people  smuggling, and whether co-operation between countries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka was  adequate. 

 The Opposition is again renewing those calls. 

  “Unfortunately, budget cutbacks have moved resources to Border Protection Command and the  monitoring and management of unauthorised arrivals,” Ms Ley said. 

 “Both Government and Opposition agree that having the boats not leave in the first place - and  putting so many lives at risk - would be a far better option.  

 “However, the Government has only allocated a paltry amount to so-called âInternational  Engagement and Capacity Buildingâ in the last Budget - clearly not enough to support Sri Lanka  and Indonesia in their efforts.”
