 M99/85 20 August 1985

 MAJOR INCREASE IN SECONDARY ALLOWANCE SCHEME (SAS) BENEFITS AS A 

 FIRST STEP IN RATIONALISATION OF YOUTH INCOME ARRANGEMENTS

 The Minister for Education, Senator Susan Ryan, today announced details 

 of the new arrangements for Commonwealth financial assistance for 

 students, outlined by the Prime Minister in his policy statement on the 

 Government's Strategy for Young People.

 Senator Ryan said the Government has decided to increase the maximum 

 _  benefits available undep the Secondary Allowance Scheme (SAS) by mere 

 than 50 per cent as the first step in the rationalisation of its 

 financial support for students and unemployed youth.

 A single age-related scheme for students and unemployed youth will be 

 phased in, starting in 1987 and operating fully from 1989.

 Income test levels will in future be indexed and so will levels of 

 student allowances once the new structure is fully operational.

 Senator Ryan said today that SAS benefits would increase from $23.05 a 

 week to $35.00 a week in 1986, with family allowances to be absorbed into 

 the new rate.

 The main education allowances for secondary and tertiary students would 

 be brought into line with unemployment benefits during 1987 and 1988, so 

 that the relevant rates for young people would be equal and the full 

 structure will be established by 1989.

 Senator Ryan said the Government believed the new arrangements would give 

 young people a much stronger incentive to study and to secure 

 qualifications which would help them find and keep employment.

 She said the Government was successfully tackling the problem that had 

 defeated the previous Government - how to simplify the

 whole structure of youth allowances, remove inequities, and provide young 

 people with real incentives to participate in education.

 The indexation of student allowances and income test levels was something 

 ,  student organisations and parents had been seeking for years.

 Indexation would ensure that the relativities to be established over the 

 next three years would be maintained.

 For 1986, maximum benefits for TEAS and ASEAS would be raised from $44.51 

 to $47.50 a week for students living at home and from $68.67 to $73.28 a 

 week for those living away-from-home.

 The Marginal Adjusted Family Income (MAFI - the combined family income 

 minus certain allowable deductions) would be raised by five per cent in 

 1986. MAFI forms the basis for the income tests for SAS, TEAS, ASEAS and 

 AIC. It will be indexed in 1987 and beyond.

 Senator Ryan said that from 1988 there would be three basic sets of 

 age-related rates of Commonwealth financial support for young people:

 . A common basic rate for 16 and 17 year olds whether in secondary or 

 tertiary education or unemployed. This rate would be fully indexed 

 for movements in the consumer price index. A living away from home 

 or independent allowance would continue to be payable to eligible 

 16 and 17 year old tertiary students.

 . A common rate for unemployed 18 to 20 year olds and tertiary

 students aged 18 and over who are independent or who live away from 

 home. In 1988, rates for each group will be increased from their 

 1987 levels. The 18 to 20 Unemployment Benefit rate will 

 subsequently be fully indexed annually and the tertiary 

 independent/away-from-home rate would be equated with it.

 3/

 3

 . A common rate for secondary students aged 18 and over and for 

 tertiary students who live at home will operate from 1989. 

 Appropriate relativities and the real value for this rate will be 

 maintained by setting' it at 63 per cent of the independent tertiary 

 and 18 to 20 Unemployment Benefit rate from 1988 (see attached  table). '  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

 Senator Ryan said the precise extra costs of the new arrangements would 

 depend o n ’a number of things, including the extent to which young people 

 responded to the extra incentives to participate in education and the 

 effect of the Government's policies on youth unemployment.

 Senator Ryan said that to facilitate the amalgamation of the allowances 

 over the next three years, a number of changes would be made to existing 

 conditions: .

 . SAS benefits were currently payable only to students in Years 11

 and 12 of secondary school. From 1987, benefits would be available 

 to all secondary students aged 16 and over.

 . From 1987 secondary education allowance payments (other than those 

 .  .  for adult students) would be.paid to the person who would otherwise 

 receive family allowance (usually this is the mother). That person 

 would have the option of directing the payment to the student or 

 spouse. ,  .

 . All education allowances (with the exception of SAS in 1986 only)

 are to become taxable in the hands of the recipients, as now is the 

 case now for unemployment benefits. A personal income test for 

 secondary students will apply from 1987.

 A major difference that would remain between education allowances and the 

 unemployment benefit was that the current parental income test on .  

 education allowances for dependent students would continue, but there 

 would be no parental income test for recipients of unemployment benefits.

 .  .  STUDENT ASSISTANCE

 SUMMARY -  .  .  .

 . Expenditure on student assistance schemes will be increased by 20.4 

 per cent to $517.8 million in 1985-86, an increase of $87.4 million.

 . Living allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme 

 (TEAS) and the Adult Secondary Education Assistance* Scheme (ASEAS) 

 will be increased by 6.7 per cent. These allowances will now be 

 taxable.

 . The maximum allowance provided under the Secondary Allowances

 Scheme (SAS) for students in years 11 and 12 will be raised from 

 $23.05; a week ($1202 a year) to $35 a week ($1825 a year). While 

 the payment of family allowance for students attracting SAS will at 

 the same time be discontinued, the net result will be that all will 

 receive more, and many significantly more, than under present 

 arrangements.

 . Living allowances for postgraduate students will rise by 6.7 per 

 cent. ,

 . Under the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme, the basic 

 and additional boarding allowances and the second home allowance 

 will be increased by 6.7 per cent. '

 . Living and boarding allowances for Aboriginal secondary students 

 will also be increased by 6.7 per cent. â 

 . The qualifying limits for maximum income-tested benefits under '  

 TEAS, ASEAS, SAS and AIC will be raised by 5 per cent to ensure 

 .  that rising income levels do not penalise applicants.

 . ·  ·  Dependent child allowances will rise by $2 a week to $16 a week, to

 .  maintain parity with Additional Pension/Benefit.

 2

 An amount of $1.3 million will be allocated in grants to the States 

 and the Northern Territory under the Loan Video Program for the 

 1985-86 financial year. â 

 There will be a, further allocation of 100 special awards to 

 Aboriginal students, mainly of mature age, to enable them to 

 undertake full-time teacher training.

 3.

 Further substantial improvements are to be made in 1986 in the provisions 

 of the Secondary Allowances Scheme, which assists families on limited 

 incomes with children in the senior secondary years (years 11 and 12).

 The changes.represent an important step in bringing these benefits closer 

 to what is available for younger,tertiary students and for unemployed 

 young people of similar age.

 From the beginning, of 1986.’the Secondary Allowance will increase very 

 substantially'ih value. The maximum Secondary Allowance in 1986 will be 

 $1825 (eguivalent -  to $35 a week), compared with $1202 ($23.05 a week) in 

 1985. ‘  .

 SECONDARY ALLOWANCES SCHEME (SAS) IN 1986 - ·  ’··â ··.·'

 Although Family Allowance will no longer apply to SAS beneficiaries, 

 no-one will be disadvantaged by the change. '  Parents of secondary 

 students under the age of 18 who do not qualify for SAS will continue to 

 receive the family allowance as at present. ·

 Entitlement to SAS benefits is based on the adjusted family income, which 

 is the gross parental income for the previous financial year less a 

 deduction of $450 for each other dependent child and certain business 

 deductions for expenditure incurred in gaining the income. For 1986 the 

 level of adjusted"family income at which the "maximum allowance is paid- 

 will be increased by 5% from $14,281 to $14,995. This is the"same as the 

 level applied under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme.

 Where the adjusted family income exceeds $14,995, benefits will be 

 reduced by $2.50 for every $10 of additional income. The minimum 

 allowance, $15. a year, will be paid on adjusted family incomes between 

 $22,235 and $22,244. .

 4

 If more than one student in a family qualifies for benefits, the rate of 

 reduction of allowance drops to $1.25 for every $10 of additional 

 income. .  Families with two eligible children will therefore receive some 

 benefits on adjusted family incomes of up to $29,484. .  .  .

 Some examples of the amount of allowance payable at various levels of 

 adjusted family income are shown in the following table:

 The changes are expected to increase the number of students assisted by 

 the scheme from 66,000 in 1985 to over 78,000 in 1986. It is estimated 

 that expenditure under the scheme will increase from $63.1 million in 

 1984-85 to $94.7 million in 1985-86.

 TERTIARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE. SCHEME (TEAS) IN.1986

 TEAS provides income-tested allowances for students studying full-time in 

 approved courses at universities, colleges of advanced education, TAPE 

 colleges and certain non-government institutions.

 TEAS has been changed in a number of ways in the 1985-86 Budget:

 . an increase of 6.7% in living allowance rates

 . an increase of 5% in the income level that qualifies for full benefits

 . an increase of $2 pw in dependent child allowance

 . allowances will become taxable income in the hands of the student.

 These changes are additional to those announced in the mini-Budget 

 earlier this year. , ,  .

 The new rates of living allowances for 1986 will be increased by 6.7% and 

 are as follows: .  ’ '  .

 38 21pa (73.28pw)

 3821pa .  (73.28pw)

 Coupled with these increases will be a liberalisation of the income test 

 for 1986. The family income at. which maximum benefits will be paid in 

 1986 will increase by 5%, from $14,281 to .$14,995. This figure ,is known 

 as the marginal adjusted family income or.MAPI. .

 In the calculation of allowances the MAPI is compared with the adjusted 

 family income which is gross parental income, usually in the previous 

 financial year, less deductions for other.dependent children in the 

 family and amounts allowable under sections 51 to 54 of the Income Tax 

 Assessment Act. Where the adjusted family income exceeds the MAPI the 

 allowance tapers so that no benefit will be paid where the adjusted 

 family income exceeds $24,704 for the at-home rate and $30,084 for the 

 away-from home rate.

 The following table gives an indication of the allowance levels which

 will apply in 1986 for various adjusted family income levels;

 The Government has maintained the special concession available under the 

 income test where two or more students from the same family are 

 undertaking xa full-time tertiary course. This concession enables TEAS to 

 be paid at higher family income levels, for example, where two students 

 in a family are studying away from home allowances remain payable up to 

 an income level of $45,164.

 Where a student is married, the income test is applied to the income of 

 the spouse in the previous financial year. Maximum benefits will be paid 

 where the spouse's income does not exceed $14,995. This represents an 

 increase of 5% over the limit for 1985. Where income exceeds this limit 

 then benefits will taper until they cease to be payable at an income in 

 excess of $22,538.

 Other benefits provided under TEAS are an allowance of $42.70 a week for 

 a dependent spouse, $16 a week for each dependent child (an increase of 

 $2 over the 1985 rate) and an annual incidentals allowance of $100 if 

 attending a university; $70 if attending a college of advanced 

 education; and $30 if attending a TAPE college.

 TEAS beneficiaries living away from home may also receive a fares 

 allowance entitling them to up to three return trips a year between home 

 and their places of study. This form of assistance will no longer be 

 available from 1986 for independent students except if they live away 

 from their spouse.

 7

 Expenditure under TEAS for 1986 is expected to be about £302.1 million 

 compared with £262.1 million in 1985, an increase of about 15.3%. Some 

 113,900 students are expected to be assisted under 'the scheme in 1986 and 

 this compares with 106,750 in 1985. .  1  .  .  . · ·  ·  . . .  '

 As mentioned above, these initiatives are in addition to those announced 

 in the May Economic Statement. These initiatives which'come into effect 

 in 1986 are:- â   ·  .  .

 . the abolition of one of the income concessions namely the concession 

 which permitted living allowances to be calculated on the basis of 

 estimated income in the financial year commencing in the year of 

 study;

 . a change in the rule which enables independent status to be granted 

 on the basis of having been in,the workforce, such that students will 

 need to accumulate 2 years' work experience in the last 3 years .  

 instead of the last 5 years; .  .  ,

 . the abolition of fares allowances for independent students except 

 those who need to live away from their spouse to study; .

 . the absorption of the family allowance, within the TEAS living 

 allowance. ·  -

 The changes announced in May enabled savings in 1986 estimated at £2.4 

 million. Those savings have been taken into account in the estimated 

 expenditures referred to above. ·

 8.

 ASEAS assists mature students, that is, those aged over 19 who have been 

 away £ rbm secondary schooling for a total period of at least two years in 

 the previous five years, to undertake matriculation level courses. 

 Assistance is generally provided for one year, but two years' benefits 

 are available in some circumstances. There is some relaxation of the 

 eligibility conditions for refugee students.

 For 1986 the living allowances paid under the scheme will continue to be 

 aligned with those of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS). 

 This will mean a 6.7% increase in the allowance rates, as follows:

 Independent 3581pa (68.67pw) 38 21pa (73.28pw)

 The level of adjusted family income (ie. parental income in the previous 

 financial year less certain deductions) at which maximum allowances will 

 be paid to dependent students for 1986 will be increased by 5% from 

 $14,281 to $14,995. For adjusted family income in excess of $14,995, the 

 allowance will be reduced on a sliding scale. A partial allowance will 

 be paid in 1986 where the adjusted family income does not exceed $24,704 

 for the at-home allowance and $30,084 for the away-from-home allowance.

 Where a student is married, an income test is applied to the spouse's 

 income for the previous financial year. The level of the spouse's income 

 at which the maximum benefits will be paid in 1986 will also be increased 

 from $14,281 to $14,995. A partial allowance will be paid where the 

 spouse's income does not exceed $22,538.

 For all students, personal income is also taken into account. A Student 

 may earn up to $2000 from other sources without loss of benefit.

 However, the living allowance is reduced by $1 for every $2 of personal 

 income above that level.

 9.

 Other benefits provided under ASEAS are an allowance Of $42.70 a week for·  

 a dependent spouse, $16 a week for each dependent child, an increase of 

 $2 per week in 1986, and an incidentals allowance of $30. Dependent 

 students and married independent students living away from home to study 

 may also receive a fares allowance for three return trips a year between 

 home and their educational institutions.

 From the beginning of 1986 ASEAS allowances will be taxable in the hands 

 .of the student.

 Expenditure under the scheme is expected to increase from $8.4 million in 

 1984-86' to about $9.6 million in 1985-86. About·3200 students are 

 expected to benefit under the scheme next year. ,

 for Masters and PhD degrees on a full-time basis at. universities and .  

 colleges of advanced education. Awards are tenable for up to two years .  

 for Masters courses and up to four years for a PhD. The Awards are 

 competitive. They are made available free of an income test, but 

 benefits are taxable. · · . . . . ,

 There are three types of Postgraduate Awards - Research Awards for 

 Masters and PhD programs by research at universities, Course Awards for 

 Masters courses .by coursework in universities, and Advanced Education 

 Institution Awards for Masters courses in.colleges of advanced V.

 education. The total number of new Awards available for 1986 will be 900.

 The living allowance under the Awards will be increased by 6.7% for 1986, 

 from $7,616 to $8,126 per annum and the dependent child allowance will 

 increase from $14 to $16 per week. "

 Other benefits provided under the Awards include a dependent spouse 

 allowance of $42.70 a week and incidentals, thesis and establishment 

 allowances. An award holder may receive $1,000 from an award provided by 

 an educational institution and $5,000 from an award provided by private 

 sector sources without affecting the entitlement. .

 As a result of the Budget decisions, expenditure on Postgraduate Awards 

 is expected to rise from $17.7 million for 1984-85 approximately to 

 $19.3 million for 1985-86.

 11.

 ASSISTANCE FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN SCHEME (AIC) IN 1986

 This scheme provides financial assistance to the parents of children who, 

 by reason of geographic isolation or a handicap must live away from home 

 to attend school, study by correspondence or live at a second family home 

 which provides daily access to schooling. -

 Students living away from home to attend school comprise some 75% of 

 those assisted under the scheme. All such students who satisfy the 

 eligibility requirements qualify for a basic allowance free of income 

 test. They may also attract an additional allowance which depends on 

 their parents' income and their boarding costs. .

 For 1986 both the basic and additional boarding allowances will be 

 increased by 6.7%. The basic allowance will rise from $927 to $989 a 

 year. A comparison between the 1985 and 1986 rates of the additional .  

 boarding allowance, according to level of .schooling, is given below:

 1985 1986

 * *

 Senior secondary 1745 .  1862

 Junior secondary 1444 1541

 Primary 1221 1303

 The qualifying level of the income test for the additional boarding 

 allowance will also be increased. Entitlement is based on the adjusted 

 family income, which is the gross parental income for the previous 

 financial year less a deduction of $450 for each other dependent child 

 and certain business deductions for costs incurred in gaining the 

 income. For 1986 the level of adjusted family income at which the 

 maximum additional boarding allowance is paid will be raised by 5% from 

 $12,974 to $13,623. '

 Smaller amounts of allowance will be paid, on a sliding scale, on income 

 levels above $13,623. These upper income levels will be even higher 

 where more than one student in the family qualifies for AIC benefits.

 The table below illustrates the levels of income up to which some 

 additional boarding allowance will be paid in 1986, depending on the

 student's year of schooling and the number of other eligible children in 

 the family.

 There will also be a 6.7% increase in the second home allowance, which is 

 paid to isolated·families who maintain a second family home to give their 

 children access to schooling. The 1985 and 1986 levels of this allowance 

 are as follows: '

 The scheme will continue to' provide "in 1986 a correspondence allowance of 

 £500 a year per child as well as special allowances for pre-school 

 correspondence children and children in short-term boarding situations. 

 All these allowances are free of income test. '

 The total number of children expected to qualify for AIC benefits in 1986

 is expected to be about 21,800. It is estimated that expenditure under

 the scheme will rise from about £22.7 million in 1984-85 to about £24.9

 million in 1985-86. %

 13.

 1987 AND AFTER - THE NEW DEAL FOR STUDENTS

 As a result of the fundamental review of income support arrangements for 

 young people, the three general student assistance schemes - SAS, TEAS 

 and ASEAS - will be replaced from 1987 by an age-related scheme with 

 differential rates of allowances for 16-17 year olds and those aged 18 

 and over. ,

 Within each of these age groupings, the rates for secondary students will 

 continue to move towards the corresponding rate for tertiary students 

 until they are eventually the same; this point will be reached in 1988 

 in the case of 16-17 year olds and in 1989 for the older age group.

 At the same time, the gaps that currently exist between education 

 allowances and OB levels will be progressively reduced, so that from 1988 

 the comparable rates of allowances for students and unemployed young 

 people will be identical. .

 When this point is reached, there will be no financial disincentive 

 remaining to discourage young people from low income families from 

 continuing with, or returning to, education and training. Moreover, the 

 rates of allowances will thereafter be indexed to ensure that they remain 

 aligned and that their real value at least is maintained.

 The family income threshold level, that is, the income level at which the 

 allowances begin to taper, will itself be indexed annually.

 Further, from 1989 the rates for secondary students and for 

 tertiary/adult secondary 'at home1  students in the older age group will 

 be set and maintained at the level of 63% of the tertiary/adult secondary 

 'away from home' rate.

 As part of the process of rationalisation of education allowances, from 

 1987 personal income testing will be extended to students in receipt of 

 secondary allowances, and the incidentals allowance (averaging $1.60) 

 that is currently payable to students in receipt of tertiary allowances 

 will be absorbed into the new higher rates of allowance.

 14.

 In terms of actual rates, secondary students in 1987 widl receive maximum 

 allowances of $40 at ages 16-17 and $45 if aged 18 or more; for tertiary 

 students, and for some adult students returning to secondary education 

 after a break, maximum rates will be $50 (at home)/$73.28 

 (away/independent) for 16-17 year olds and $55/$80 for 18+ year olds.

 Rates for 1988 and beyond will be based essentially on CPI movements in 

 the preceding period, and cannot therefore be specified this far in 

 advance. .
