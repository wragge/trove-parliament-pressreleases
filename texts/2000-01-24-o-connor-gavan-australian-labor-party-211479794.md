  MEDIA RELEASE

  GAVAN O’CONNOR MP

 Member for Corio

 Shadow Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry

  

  

  Coast Guard will strengthen Quarantine Function 
and Protection of Fisheries

  

  Labor’s initiative to establish an Australian Coast guard 
will strengthen the fight against illegal fishing in the Australian 
Fishing Zone (AFZ) and will bolster Australia’s quarantine effort 
particularly in Northern Australia, according to Labor’s Shadow Minister 
for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, Gavan O’Connor.

  

 In recent years there has been a significant upsurge 
in illegal fishing in the AFZ by foreign fishers seeking high value 
catch for lucrative international markets particularly in Asia.

  

 Illegal fishing threatens the long term economic viability 
and environmental sustainability of some very significant fisheries 
under Australian jurisdiction.

  

 An Australian Coastguard will provide a more coordinated 
approach to the detection of illegal fishing activity, and will serve 
as a more effective deterrent to illegal foreign fishing in the AFZ.

  

 On the quarantine front an Australian Coastguard will 
provide an improved border surveillance capacity that will significantly 
enhance Australia’s quarantine effort, particularly the Northern Australia 
Quarantine Strategy (NAQS).

  

 Australia’s quarantine task is made more difficult 
by illegal boat people arrivals, illegal landings by traditional fishing 
boats and pleasure craft, all of which increase the risk of importing 
diseased food, plants and animals and exotic pests and weeds.

  

 Border surveillance is an important part of the NAQS, 
and a new Australian Coastguard will significantly enhance the operations 
element of the strategy.

  

 The time is long overdue for the development of a 
well trained and well equipped organisation that will be able to deliver 
more efficient coastal surveillance and maritime protection services

  

 Labor’s Coastguard will deliver an improved quarantine 
capacity and an enhanced ability to combat illegal fishing.
