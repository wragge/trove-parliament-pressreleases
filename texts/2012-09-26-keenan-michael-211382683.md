 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 101 BOATS IN 100 DAYS September 26, 2012

 101 boats have illegally arrived in the last 100 days under Labor’s failed border protection policies, after the arrival of two  more  today  with  a  total  of  53  people  on  board,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott  Morrison  and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Julia Gillard and Minister Bowen today mark yet another shameful milestone in their long list of border protection failures, with 101 boats illegally entering Australia in the last 100 days, carrying a total of more than 6,400 people," Mr Morrison said. 

 "Every  new  day  under  this  Labor  Government  brings  yet  another  boat and a bigger  burden  of cost  and  chaos  saddled upon  Australian  taxpayers.  Just  this  week  the  Government  had  to  reveal  another  $208  million  in  cost  blowouts  on  last year’s arrivals," he said. 

 "In  2011/12,  112  boats  illegally  entered  Australia.  The  annual  bill  for  managing  asylum  seekers  in  2011/12  was  $1.37 billion. That’s more than $12 million a boat, and we’ve had more than 100 in the last 100 days. 

 "Having  to  be  dragged  kicking  and  screaming  to  introduce  half  measures  on  our  borders,  Labor  continues  to  refuse  to restore the full suite of Howard Government policies that stopped the boats. 

 "Labor’s half hearted solution on border protection is a continued recipe for further cost, chaos and tragedy. 

 "Half  hearted  measures  and  ongoing  denial  won’t  stop  the  mounting  economic  costs  of  Labor’s  failure.  Wayne  Swan’s   budget has already blown, with more people arriving in less than a quarter of this financial year than what he budgeted would arrive during the entire year. 

 "Further  inaction  will  result  in  more  taxpayer  money  being  thrown  at  border  protection  budget  blow  outs  which  have already reached over $4.9 billion over the last four years," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "The arrival of two boats near Cocos (Keeling) Islands today carrying at total of 53 people indicates that the people smugglers are simply not taking the Gillard Labor Government seriously. 

 "This rolling crisis is a long way from being solved, given there have been 94 more boats and over 6,000 more people arriving to our shores compared with the total for 2011, and we are only in September. 

 "This month alone there have been 28 boats carrying over 1,700 people - this should send a message to the Government  that they need to get serious and implement the Coalition’s full suite of border protection measures to stem this constant flow of boats, which has been on average just over one per day. 

 "Our  frontline service  men and women  of Customs  Border  Protection  Command are  being asked yet  again  to do  more with  less  - this  rate  of  arrivals  is  simply  not  sustainable  and  will  put  further  strain  on  our  already  overstretched  border protection forces," Mr Keenan said.
