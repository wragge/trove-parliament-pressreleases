 MORRISON:    

 Over the course of the last six years, we have seen failure after failure after failure by this  government on border protection.  Labor is the guilty party when it comes to border  protection failures in this country.  In the first term of the Labor Government 7,500  people turned up illegally by boat.  In this term of Parliament, we’ve seen more than  40,000 people turn up illegally by boat.  Over that time, they’ve promised East Timor  solutions, asylum freezes, they’ve had Malaysian people flops, they’ve had asylum return  agreements with Afghanistan that hasn’t actually returned anyone in any numbers at all.      

 What we’ve seen every time as Labor has made the big bold announcements, they’ve  always unravelled at the end and that is the great risk here again.  The government’s PNG  election fix is being held together by sticky tape at the moment and it is barely able to  stand up to election day.  The revelations again today of the serious issues on Manus  Island where sites like the dump site have been denied access and the locals are proving  to be very unhappy with the way that the Rudd Government has been handling the issues 

 on PNG means not only is the government unable to explain now in this final week of the  campaign how it plans to resettle anyone in PNG, let alone everyone in PNG.  Unable to  give one sentence about where they will be resettled, under what terms, for how long and  when legislation will be introduced into the PNG parliament to give effect to any of these  things.  Now also the issue of offshore processing on Papua New Guinea is unravelling  by the day.      

 This is a government who, at the last election, dumped a whole bunch lot of problems in  our detention network on the other side of the election and we all know what happened  after 2010.  We had the detention centres go up in flames when Labor pushed off  decisions and failed to deal with their border protection failures before the last election,  chaos followed.  And before this election again, we see this PNG arrangement held  together with sticky tape prior to this election, and all the implementation issues, all the  difficult things that need to be done to give effect to an arrangement like this, remain to  be done on the other side of an election.   

 

 And so, as Labor continue to try and dump all of the implementation issues on the other  side of the election, I think Australians are faced with a very clear choice.  Who do they  trust to be able to deal with border protection issues on the other side of an election?  The  Coalition in this campaign and over the last four years have been very clear about what  we are offering the Australian people.  We will restore temporary protection visas that  deny permanent residence, we will have genuine offshore processing, not the farce this  government has been running for the past year, we will turn boats back where it is safe to  do so, we will ensure that those who throw their documents away will not be in the queue  at all when it comes to refugee assessment, not at the back of the queue as the Labor  Party is proposing, we will putting in place a comprehensive Regional Deterrence  Framework, backed up by $420 million of commitments that go out there whether it’s at  sea or whether it’s on land, working together, working in Australia’s sovereign interests  to ensure that we disrupt people smugglers’ activity from Australia all the way up  through the source.  That’s the comprehensive plan, that’s the solution that will work.   It’s the solution that has worked before and it would be implemented by a Coalition  Government with the proven resolve and the proven record to get on and fix Labor’s  mess which they seem content to just dump on the other side of an election yet again.      

 QUESTION:   

 You didn’t mention the Coalition’s boat buyback policy there -     

 MORRISON:   

 I did, actually.    

 QUESTION:   

 Yesterday we had Tony Abbott conceding that perhaps there will be no boats bought 

 back under this policy.  Why was it announced if, in practice, you are not going to do  what it was intended to do?    

 MORRISON:   

 That measure is part of the $420 million Regional Deterrence Framework which we  announced a few weeks ago, which includes $67 million to support the Australian  Federal Police to do joint operations with the Indonesian police.  It includes $20 million  for a community outreach programme to ensure we enlist villages in supporting us, which  includes the bounties as well.  It includes putting a supplementary fleet with our border  protection command fleet which enables our navy to be out there and our customs service  patrolling and intercepting vessels, not running a taxi service as they are under this  government.  This is a comprehensive package backed up by a comprehensive team on  the Coalition side that are ready, willing and able to get the job done on border  protection.    

 QUESTION:   

 But are you confident that boats will be bought back under this plan?      

 MORRISON:   

 It will be part of the suite of operational measures...    

 QUESTION:    

 So it will happen?    

 MORRISON:    

 It’s part of the suite of operational measures that will be available to those joint task  forces and teams on the ground.  It was always an operational decision about how and  when that’s deployed and that will be an important tool in the box for them.      

 QUESTION:   

 The Coalition has this strong border protection policy proven track record methods that  work, yes?      

 MORRISON:   

 That’s right.    

 QUESTION: 

 

 Then why would you introduce this new buyback option so late in the election process  and then turn around and say it may not actually even do what it was supposed to do?    

 MORRISON:   

 Well we haven’t said that at all, you’re saying that.   

 QUESTION:   

 Ok.    

 MORRISON:   

 You’re saying that.      

 QUESTION:   

 Yep.      

 MORRISON:   

 So, I’m not saying that.  You are.      

 QUESTION:   

 Ok.   

 

 MORRISON:   

 It’s part of a Regional Deterrence Framework of measures and we had a Regional  Deterrence Framework when we were last in government as well.  You need to be  constantly filling your toolbox of measures in border protection to ensure that you can get  the job done.   And working with our regional partners throughout the region, we did this  with the Indonesian Government when we were in government last time, through our  cooperation between the Federal Police and the Indonesian National Police and we will  do it again.  Labor is cutting resources to the AFP.  Labor is cutting our presence up in  Indonesia to combat people smuggling.  The Coalition is committing additional resources  to disrupt people smuggling in Indonesia, in Malaysia, in Sri Lanka and all the way up  through the chain and that’s what our focus is, because we believe in it.  This is a  government that has to be dragged kicking and screaming every single time to do  something in this space.  The Coalition has always believed in it and that’s why you can  rely on the Coalition.  We believe in strong border protection.  Kevin Rudd believes in  election fixes, just like Julia Gillard did at the last election with her East Timor fix, we all  know where that ended and we can see as we speak up in Manus Island at the moment 

 where this government’s solution is heading if they’re elected on the other side of next  Saturday.    

 QUESTION:   

 Can I ask you about policing detention centres?  How will you ensure that there are no  jurisdictional issues and say the service provider doesn’t assume something is the  responsibility of police and vice versa and things fall through the cracks?   

 

 MORRISON:   

 One of the key recommendations the Coalition made after the joint parliamentary select  committee into the riots that occurred in Villawood and on Christmas Island was the need  to get these jurisdictional issues sorted out between State and Territory police and the  Commonwealth, particularly with DIAC including access to sites and all of these sorts of  things.  Now Memorandums of Understanding still remain not finalised between the  NSW Police and DIAC, between the Queensland Police and DIAC, between the South  Australian police and DIAC, between the Western Australian police and DIAC.  They  exist as we understand it in two jurisdictions; Tasmania and the Northern Territory.   These jurisdictional issues are critical to deal with things when they go wrong in your  detention network and we saw that in the riots at Villawood where state police had to  stand on the sideline basically while people got on rooves and others burnt the centre to  the ground.  That issue remains unresolved by Labor to this day.  The Labor government  was warned before the Villawood riots that they could face something like this and they  dismissed it.  When it was put to them by the NSW police that they were at risk of a  centre being subject to riots and arson, they even dismissed it as a possibility.  That’s why  we need a closer working relationship between the state police and DIAC and the  Commonwealth more generally in how we manage not only the detention network but  also the bridging visa programme as well.    

 QUESTION:    

 If elected this Saturday, do you concede that perhaps you will have a really large task on  your hands given the situation in Syria at the moment, there could be an enormous influx  of refugees coming out of that country as there already is?    

 MORRISON:    

 Labor has left an enormous mess on our borders, an unprecedented level of mess.  That  mess extends to the arrivals, it extends to what’s occurred in our detention network, there  are  so  many  loose  ends  in  Labor’s  border  protection  arrangements  that  Labor  is  just   tripping  over  them  every single  day.  Pressures  around  the  world  continue  and  whether   it’s in Syria or whether it’s in Egypt or whether it’s other parts of the Middle East, there  remains a big claim on resettlement places in Australia and that’s why the Coalition has  moved to ensure that never again do we have the situation where permanent visas that are  supposed to be available  to people waiting offshore like people in Syria,  like people in 

 Egypt,  that  their  visas  will  be  taken  by  people  who  come  illegally  by  boat.  We  have   completely separated those two programmes.  If you come illegally by boat then the best  you  can  ever  hope  for  is  a  temporary  visa  not  a  permanent  visa  out  of  another   programme.  Our Offshore Special Humanitarian programme and our refugee programme  has been quarantined, absolutely quarantined so we can address the needs that will come  upon that programme particularly with the unrest we’ve seen in the Middle East. 

 

 QUESTION:    

 Has  the  Coalition  put  all  of  its  border  protection  policies  because  you’ve  announced  a   number of additional planks during the election campaign to the PBO yet and when are  we going to see the full raft of costings?    

 MORRISON:    

 Well I’ll leave the costings questions to Joe Hockey, he’s the Shadow Treasurer.  As you  know, each of the policies that I’ve put out, whether it’s the $420 million for the Regional  Deterrence  Framework,  the  $10  million  to  support  the  Operation  Sovereign  borders   initiative, all of these measures and the costs of them have been included.  The additional  capacity on  Nauru  - we are redirecting $58 million that the government wants to spend  building  a  detention  facility  in  Singleton,  we  are  going  to  take  those  resources  and   expand the capacity on Nauru.  So in each of the measures we’ve announced we’ve been  very clear about the individual costs of those arrangements and the Shadow Treasurer I’m  sure between now and election day will be going through those elements in terms of the  overall  package  of  savings  measures  as  he’s  already  outlined  a  very  significant   component  of  that  last  week.  There  are  still  several days  to  go  between  now  and  the   election and when the election is on you’ll know that we’ve announced all our policies.    

 QUESTION:    

 And  have  you  - are  you  going  to  be  projecting  forecasts  across  the  forward  estimates   periods on the numbers of arrivals?    

 MORRISON:    

 Well our costings include our assumptions in terms of the savings we believe that can be  made in this area by the successful implementation of our policies.  Thanks for your time.
