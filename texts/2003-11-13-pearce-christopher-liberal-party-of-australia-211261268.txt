 FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SETTLEMENT SERVICES IN ASTON    

 Aston  MP  Chris  Pearce  today  called  on  local  not-for-profit organisations and  councils  to  consider  applying  for  funding under the Australian Governmentâ€™s  Community  Settlement  Services  Scheme,  which  helps  provide  settlement  services for refugees, special humanitarian program entrants, and migrants.   

 Mr  Pearce  said  the  Community  Settlement  Services  Scheme  was  an  important  investment  in  assisting  new  arrivals  to  become  confident  and  contributing members of the Australian community.   

 The  Community  Settlement  Services  Scheme  funds  projects  that  provide   access  to  mainstream  services,  develop  networks  that  engage  mainstream   service  providers  to  deliver  culturally  appropriate  services,  and  are  self-sustaining beyond the period of the grant.    

 Priority  is  given  to  addressing  the  settlement  needs  of  permanent  residents   that  have  arrived  in  the  last  five  years  as  humanitarian  entrants and family  stream migrants with low English proficiency.   

 Communities requiring assistance to develop their capacity to organise, plan  and  advocate  for  services  to  meet  their  own  needs  and  that  are  receiving   significant numbers of new arrivals within the settlement services target group  are also prioritised.   

 Last year, the Lao Australian Welfare Association in Forest Hill received over  $91,000 under the Community Settlement Services Scheme.   

 More  information,  including  application  forms,  is  available  online  at  www.immi.gov.au/grants or by phoning 1800 453 003. Applications close on  Friday 5 December 2003.
