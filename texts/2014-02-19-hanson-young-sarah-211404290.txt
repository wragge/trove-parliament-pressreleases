 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 19 February 2014   

 Serious questions remain; reports of five  unaccompanied children on Manus  Island   

 The Australian Government cannot maintain its silent refusal to take responsibility for the  tragic incident on Manus Island that resulted in an Iranian refugee’s murder, the  Australian Greens have said.   

 “The lack of information coming from the Australian Government simply isn’t good  enough,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “There are very concerning reports that there were five unaccompanied children in the  Manus Island gulag at the time of the riot. We know that young boys have been  wrongfully sent to Manus Island in the past and the Australian people need to know  whether these reports are accurate.   

 “The Immigration Minister is refusing to take responsibility for this tragic incident, but  nothing can change the fact that what happened on Monday night was the Australian  Government’s fault.   

 “The Australian Human Rights Commission and the media need to be given access to  the detention camp on Manus Island.   

 “Until that level of access is granted, Australians will never know the truth about what is  happening inside the gulags on Nauru and Manus Island.”
