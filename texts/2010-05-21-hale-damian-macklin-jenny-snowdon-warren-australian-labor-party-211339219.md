 $800,000 investment in community projects for the Territory    

 

 The Rudd Government is providing $862,938 for nine community projects in the  Northern Territory to encourage strong families, leadership and volunteering.    

 The initiatives include a radio project in Arnhem land, a project to build parenting and  relationship skills in the Darwin region and Gove; projects supporting youth in the  bush around Cental Australia; support for children and families of immigrants and  refugees; and support for town camp residents at various locations, (follow link  below).   

 These projects provide on the ground, practical help for people facing social and  personal challenges and also help strengthen communities through locally  developed initiatives.    

 In total, the Rudd Government is investing in more than 220 projects across Australia  worth $19.6 million under the Community Investment Program.The program's  projects have a strong focus on supporting vulnerable children and families, and  building cohesive and strong communities.    

 Local organisations deliver each project in response to community needs, such as  early intervention parenting support, support for volunteering and mentoring and  camps for young people.     

 The Government values the enormous contribution these organisations make to  local communities.     

 By working with organisations with local knowledge and links we can help build  strong communities.
