 TRANSCRIPT

 THE HON PETER COSTELLO MP Treasurer

 Doorstop Interview Crown Towers, Melbourne

 Friday, 14 May 2004 9.00 am 

 SUBJECTS: Mark Latham’s Budget reply, Reserve Bank board , children in detention centers

 JOURNALIST:

 Treasurer, your reply to Mr Latham please, in a nutshell?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I think Mr Latham’s speech last night really let the Australian public down, he didn’t do a Budget  reply, a Budget reply consists of going through the Budget saying what things the Opposition agrees  with, what things it doesn’t, putting forward alternative tax proposals and putting forward when they will  start, how they will be paid for and what the Opposition would do if it were bringing down a Budget. What  we had was we had Mr Latham in his speech last night waffling, talking about motherhood statements,  full of clichÃ©s, giving no detail and I think really letting the Australian public down.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Latham has promised even bigger tax cuts than yours at the same time he has promised lower  spending and economic and responsibility, is that possible?

 TREAUSRER:

 Well, Mr Latham says he is going to cut tax, he can’t tell you what the rates will be, by how much, when,  who it will apply to or how it will be paid for, and then he says after he has done that he is going to spend  more, as that he will tax less, spend more and have more left over at the end of it. It just doesn’t add up.  It is treating the Budget reply really as a bit of a joke, he can’t have expected to get away with this, and I  think the Australian public will feel very badly let down.

 JOURNALIST:

 This (inaudible) you learn or earn proposal, what do you think of that? It sounds like he is copying your…

 TREASURER:

 Well, the Government introduced a scheme called work for the dole, and the work for the dole scheme  was for those young people who weren’t students, who weren’t studying and weren’t in work, that if they 

 wanted to qualify for the dole, they would have to work. This is the scheme which the Government  introduced, Labor opposed it, so let’s not worry about any of these new names, let’s get on with what the  Government has been doing, the work for the dole scheme.

 JOURNALIST:

 So, this is another mutual obligation (inaudible) set up?

 TREASURER:

 This is mutual obligation, the obligation of people to societies, society to people, and if you want to collect  the dole as a young person, you should be doing some community work, that is the work for the dole  scheme which we introduced more than five years ago.

 JOURNALIST:

 You made a couple of cracks at Simon Crean during your speech, you don’t think Simon is up to a  Budget?

 TREASURER:

 Well, you can’t go around on the news media of Australia claiming that 8.5 million families are worse off,  when there are only 4.9 million families in the country. You make up these figures, you try and get the  journalists to repeat them, but you get found out, and this is the thing with the Labor Party, they get found  out, they haven’t done the work, they don’t have the policy, they have got no detail. Mr Latham treated  the public very shabbily with his Budget reply, and it is about time he did some work and tried to get on  top of policy.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you judge yourself by the same standards of factual detail?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I think you will find that our Budget is fully costed and fully accurate.

 JOURNALIST:

 On the top tax rates, I think you said before that there are political constraints about how far you can  move the thresholds and how low you can drop the rates, what should they be?

 TREASURER:

 Well, what they should be is the rates which we announced on Budget night which is the top rate should  cut in at $80,000 and the 30 per cent rate should be increased so that most Australians have a tax rate of  30 per cent or less.

 JOURNALIST:

 You delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to the Australian Tax Office for education and for  compliance functions, what particularly did you have in mind?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I think it is important the Tax Office does help people with their tax returns, I think there are a lot of  people that want to comply but sometimes they need help in explanation, that requires tax officials who 

 actually know what they are doing, so that is part of the educational position, in addition to that the Tax  Office does auditing work, they do that on behalf of the community, those fewer people who don’t comply  need to be audited, so this what that program is all about.

 JOURNALIST:

 On the Reserve Bank board, just leaving Budget all together, is there a place for the concept of conflict of  interest on the board that presents some outside people working on the board, or some board members  doing outside work?

 TREASURER:

 Well, members of the Reserve Bank board can’t be directors of or engage in the management of  financial institutions for those reasons, and so this has always been the case, you would never have  anybody from a bank or involved in the management of a bank or a director of a bank on the Reserve  Bank board, and that goes back to the fact that the bank used to do prudential supervision even though it  doesn’t now. But we have always had business people on the Reserve Bank board and you can say if  you want to that anyone involved in business has an interest in monetary policy, it is obvious they do, but  it has always been accepted that if you want people with business experience on the bank board as we  always have had, that you will have to live with that, that is the reality you know, if you took the conflict of  interest to extreme lengths nobody could serve on the Reserve Bank, not even the Governor who  presumably has a mortgage himself. You have got to live in a society, you have got to have a house and  you have got to have a mortgage and at the end of the day, that means that you will have people on the  bank who are house buyers who are dealing in monetary policy but there is no other way of getting  around it.

 JOURNALIST:

 I just wanted to ask you one thing finally, I was just watching you with the kids there and I do think that as  a senior government figure, are you concerned about the human rights commission report saying that  really we should not have children in detention centres and we are breaking the UN conventions left,  right and centre?

 TREASURER:

 I think we would all like to see a situation where you didn’t have people who came into Australia without  visas, there is plenty of opportunity coming to Australia with a visa if you are a refugee, we take 12,000.  And I think with the children in detention, if we can process those cases quickly and get their parents  dealt with then you can get the children out and we have some services now where families can live in  the community over at Port Augusta, so nobody likes to see anybody in detention, so I think stopping the  trade of illegals into the country in the first place, dealing with the claims quickly when they arrive in the  second place, and thirdly having some of those alternatives like in the community is the best way of  addressing it. Thank you.
