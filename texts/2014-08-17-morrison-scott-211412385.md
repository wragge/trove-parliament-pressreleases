 Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison 

 Stopping the boats to help Iraqis and Syrians  Sunday, 17 August 2014 

 People affected by the humanitarian crises in Iraq and Syria will be primary  beneficiaries of the success of the government's strong border protection policies,  with 4 400 resettlement places set aside in the Australian Government's 2014-15  Refugee and Humanitarian Programme, Minister for Immigration and Border  Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison, said today. 

 'The government's policies under Operation Sovereign Borders have not only saved  lives at sea, but also allowed more places to be returned to our humanitarian  programme for the world's most desperate and vulnerable people,' Minister Morrison  said. 

 'The government will continue our commitment to use our Refugee and Special  Humanitarian Programme to assist those affected by the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. 

 'With the continued violence in Iraq and Syria, the Australian Government is  dedicated to ensuring its humanitarian programme reaches those who need it most. 

 'In 2014-15 the government has committed a minimum of 2 200 places for Iraqis,  including ethnic and religious minorities fleeing the violence in northern Iraq to  neighbouring countries. 

 'The government has also committed a minimum of 2 200 places for Syrians,  including those now living in desperate conditions in countries such as Lebanon. A  further medium term commitment has been made to accept at least 4 500 Syrians  over the next three years. 

 'These places are once again being provided predominantly out of the Special  Humanitarian Programme (SHP) which seeks to settle people with established links  and communities of support in Australia. 

 'The commitment to these groups highlights the humanitarian dividend from the  government's successful border protection policies. This government has made it  very clear that priority in the humanitarian programme should be for those waiting  overseas and entering Australia under an orderly process. 

 'Combined with our refugee intake, we were last year able to respond to the terrible  conflict in Syria by providing more than 1 000 places to Syrian nationals. 

 'In addition, more than 2 000 places were provided to Iraqis, with over 1 500 of these  provided through the SHP which had been decimated under the previous  government who provided just over 500 places for all nationalities in 2012-13. 

 'By taking the decision to deny permanent visas to those who came illegally by boat  and achieving the success we were able to achieve in stopping the flow of boats, we  freed up more than 4 000 places in our SHP in 2013-14 and more than 4 000 places  in 2014-15.   

 'The SHP receives up to 40 000 applications every year. In 2013-14, more than  18 000 applications were received from Iraqis, Syrians and Burmese alone. 

 'It was extremely disappointing that up to 4 000 applicants waiting in the queue  missed out on places in this programme, and that their places were being taken up  by those who had arrived illegally by boat. This practice has ended under the Abbott  Government, as promised. 

 'In 2013-14 the government also honoured our election commitments to quarantine  more than 11 000 visas for those who applied offshore and, within this intake, ensure  that 1 000 places were provided to women at risk. 

 'More than 1 050 Woman at Risk visas were granted in 2013-14, bringing the total  number of visas granted to these most vulnerable of refugees over the last 25 years  to 14 500. The majority of women at risk in 2013-14 were from Afghanistan. 

 'In addition to those affected by the Iraqi and Syrian conflicts, the government  continued to resettle Burmese refugees with just over 1 800 provided places during  the year, while 2 754 Afghans (including more than 500 Afghan LEE) who had  applied offshore through the proper process, from places such as Pakistan and Iran,  were also granted permanent visas in Australia. 

 'Earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit Myanmar and see the conditions on the  ground and have taken the opportunity to discuss the issue of Burmese refugees  with my counterparts throughout South East Asia during my various regional  engagements. 

 'While the situation is improving in Myanmar, and we wish to encourage this process,  the government will continue to support the resettlement of Burmese refugees in  Australia, in particular those from the many Christian ethnic minorities currently living  in Malaysia and Thailand, such as the Karen and Chin, who have strong networks of  support in Australia. A total of 2 000 places, including 1 200 under the UNHCR  mandated refugee programme, have been allocated in 2014-15. 

 'In 2014-15, the government is again ensuring that 11 000 of the 13 750 places in the  humanitarian programme are for people overseas in need of resettlement. There will  be 6 000 places for refugees referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, including 1 000 places for women. 

 at risk and their dependants and 5 000 for people proposed by their close family in  Australia under the SHP. The 5 000 places for the SHP represents a further increase  of almost 500 places on 2013/14 and is the highest allocation for the programme  since 2006/07. 

 'Everyone who is accepted under the formal refugee and humanitarian programme  are subject to the appropriate checks. It is not simply a process of walking straight  out of a camp and onto a plane. Issues, such as identity, health and security are all  subject to assessment. The programme also endeavours to focus on those who  have a network of support that can assist their resettlement, such as local church  communities who have strong ethnic and cultural connections. This has proved  particularly helpful for those being resettled from the Middle East and Burma. 

 'Australia will continue to work with countries in our region to seek to stabilise  displaced populations and find appropriate solutions for their protection and safety,'  Minister Morrison said.
