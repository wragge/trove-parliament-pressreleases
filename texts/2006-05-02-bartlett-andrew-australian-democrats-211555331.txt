 Government Hypocritical on Chequebook diplomacy

 Foreign Minister Alexander Downers warning to Taiwan against chequebook diplomacy in the South  Pacific is the height of hypocrisy, according to the Australian Democrats.   

 The Australian Government has been quite willing to use the taxpayers chequebook over the last few  years to bribe the financially strapped nation of Nauru to lock up our refugees and keep the media and  supporters away from them, Democrats Deputy Leader Andrew Bartlett said.   

 Mr Downer has had the gall in the past to criticise Nauru for giving diplomatic recognition to Taiwan in  exchange for immediate financial assistance, despite his own government spending hundreds of millions  to get Nauru to help with the political problem of refugees in 2001.   

 If Australia was genuinely concerned about the long-term well being of Pacific Island nations, it would:   

 do more to stop the corruption and overlogging in the forest industries in the Solomon Islands and PNG;   

 stop using Nauru as a dumping ground for refugees, and    

 lift its ban on allowing unskilled seasonal workers from Pacific Island countries from filling gaps in  Australias labour market.   

 Evidence suggests that money generated from continued illegal and excessive logging involving big  companies from South-East Asia is behind much of the corruption in the Solomon Islands. This is a  much deeper problem than the continuing wrestling between China and Taiwan for diplomatic influence  in the region.   

 Unfortunately, the hypocrisy of our own Governments actions in the South Pacific in recent years has  severely weakened Australias credibility and therefore our ability to make a positive difference.
