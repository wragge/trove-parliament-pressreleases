 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 26.08.03   

 Hanson in prison but her policies still run free in Howard's Government.   

 Senator Kerry Nettle has condemned comments by Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock  today which implied that the children of detainees should be last in the queue to have  their legal rights upheld. 

 

 "The Greens reject the suggestion by the Minister that somehow children in detention  centres should have limited access to legal protection. This is a 'Hanson-esque' idea that  reeks of trying to play populist politics. 

 

 Mr Ruddock had said on the John Laws programme;  "One's not supposed to impute the integrity of judges in relation to these matters, but they  seem to have a desire to be involved in dealing with these matters, and dealing with them   quickly because they say people are in detention."     "But you know, we have many people who are convicted of offences who are sent to  jail who sometimes have to wait until the courts are ready to deal with appeals, and that  can sometimes go for years.   

 "Today marks the second anniversary of the Tampa's rescue of asylum seekers and the  Minister remains happy to demonise the children of asylum seekers.   

 "For Mr Ruddock to compare these kids to convicted criminals is the worst kind of  cynical manipulation.   

 "The Minister's comments smack of sour grapes after he has been exposed by the Family  Court as unlawfully detaining children.    

 The Greens uphold the right of all children in Australia, including those in detention, to  access the courts to protect their rights.
