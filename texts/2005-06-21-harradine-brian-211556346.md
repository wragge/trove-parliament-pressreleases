 [ THANK YOU ]   

 [THANKS - FAMILY]   

 

 Before anything else, I need to acknowledge all those who have affirmed the principles  for which I have stood, and for which I have worked, since being elected 30 years ago and  also prior to that. 

 

 To my family - bedrock of unwavering strength and inspiration. You are a blessing to me.   

 To Marian - our shared faith has transformed the stress of political life, and reinforced our  lifelong commitment to our marriage and our family.     

 To Bede, Anthony, Gemma, Paul, Mary, Fiona, Richard, Phillip, Nicola, Ann, Cushla,  David and Ben.   

 It is great to see you all here tonight.   

 To all 31 of my grandchildren - you are an affirmation of life and hope for the future.   

 [THANKS - STAFF]   

 

 To my current and former members of staff - I thank you for your loyalty and dedication.   

 My staff - Margot Scales and Virginia Challenger, electorate officers for 18 and 22 years  respectively, an amazing accomplishment.  Melinda Tankard Reist, advisor on bioethics  and human rights for 12 years and Jeremy Stuparich, indispensable advisor and researcher  on legislative matters.  And my part-time staff, Ros Seselja and Kate Mitchell.

 To all the other staff who have served my office so well over the years: Denis Strangman,  my chief advisor for my first 16 years, Lyndel Dean, John Shaw, Terry Dwyer, Philip  Vincent, Justin Kearney, Bede Harradine, Gary Scarrabelotti, Christian Fabricius, Kathryn  Millar and Catherine Cooney.   

 I especially wish to acknowledge the professionalism of my staff during balance of power  years.   

 [THANKS - SUPPORTERS]   

 

 I was first elected in 1975 with the full support of my first wife Barbara - who died from  cancer only five years later. I pay a special tribute to her tonight.   

 To all who have worked so hard supporting me through six successive election victories in  1975, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993 and 1998: I thank you all. I would not have been here  without your practical and untiring efforts. 

 

 These electoral victories were spearheaded by my great mate and campaign manager, the  late Mick Noonan.  I do not know of any political campaign manager of his equal.   

 To Kath Venn, John Jones and Colin Sacco, I pay recognition tonight to their vital  contributions as my electoral running mates.   

 As an independent Senator, I have valued the professional advice of so many highly  qualified individuals across Australia.  I acknowledge this generous counsel and advice  freely-given over many years.   

 [THANKS - PARLIAMENTARY STAFF]   

 

 I also extend my gratitude to the staff of the Senate. In particular, the Clerk, Harry Evans,  Deputy Clerk Anne Lynch, the Assistant Clerks Rosemary Laing, Cleaver Elliot and John  Vander Wyk, and also to the Black Rod Andrea Griffiths and their staff.  Deputy Clerk  Ann Lynch is retiring on 30 June after 32 years.  Her advice and demeanour were always  impeccable.  We all wish her the very best and good health in her retirement.   

 My thanks go to the Library staff who also have provided detailed and expert assistance,  often to meet tight deadlines.   

 Indeed everyone in this place including the com car drivers and protective services  personnel deserve my thanks for their untiring courtesy.    

 [THANKS - PRESS GALLERY]   

 

 To those in the Press Gallery who made the effort to grasp the nature of the big-picture  issues with which I have dealt, you perform an important service to democracy.

 I have also enjoyed the creativity displayed by cartoonists over the years in the depiction  of my more prominent features!    

 [THANKS - PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES]   

 

 Sometimes there can be an impression that parliamentarians are divided down strict  ideological lines and that there is no room for personal regard.  One of the privileges of  being here has been to see the humanity of senators and their expressions of support,  especially at times of tragedy and illness.   

 Be assured that your concern for my well-being was deeply appreciated during my recent  illness.  That goes too for the many friends I have in the other place.   

 [ REFLECTIONS ]   

 [MAIDEN SPEECH]   

 

 Senators often reflect on the key elements of their maiden speech during their valedictory  speech.  I am no exception.   

 Three elements of that speech stand out.   

 The first may come as a surprise.   

 I made it known in that speech that I never wanted to be a Senator. I came to this place  after 17 years working in the trade union movement.     

 It was my expulsion from the ALP, by the Federal Executive, under socialist Left  domination, by 9 votes to 8, in 1975, which led me to this parliamentary arena. The  Tasmanian branch supported me against the Federal Executive.    

 When the final vote came I realised there was no alternative but to appeal over the heads  of the Federal Executive to Tasmanian voters and was elected senator.   

 The second element should come as no surprise.  It is my consistent defence of the rights  and responsibilities of this Senate in pursuing the proper ends of our parliamentary  democracy.   

 The night before my maiden speech, one Senator - and one who expected me to become a  one-term-wonder - lectured new senators, about senate power in these terms:   

 what the newly elected senators have to learn is that what one says in this place  has very little relevance, very little value, in terms of parliamentary democracy   

 In short, as new Senators we were being told that we were wasting our time.

 In my maiden speech I rejected this.  I leave this place in the knowledge that I have  defended this chamber in its proper function as a house of review and not as a rubber  stamp for the government of the day. 

 

 Our grasp on democracy is indeed fragile.  It stands or falls, not merely upon the values  which it embodies and promotes, but on the way that power is exercised, and to what end.   

 I have always championed accountability to Parliament.  Senate Estimates hearings are a  key element in this process.   

 The current trend toward the shielding of important decisions from Parliamentary scrutiny  - by diverting them to unelected agencies or elites - makes a mockery of transparency and  accountability.   

 It is for these reasons I have challenged the lack of full accountability to Parliament of  numerous publicly-funded bodies.   

 As an elected representative of the Australian people, I have defended true Parliamentary  democracy by:   

 â¢ demanding oversight on decisions;   

 â¢ challenging the increasingly dominant smokescreen of commercial-in-confidence;   

 â¢ using the mechanisms of this chamber to ensure that the true intentions of  Parliament are understood and enacted; and   

 â¢ questioning the growing dominance of the executive over Parliament, sometimes  using coordinating bodies like the Council of Australian Governments which,  through lack of accountability to this chamber, pose immediate threats to the  democratic process. 

 

 Furthermore, I have affirmed the Senate’s importance as a state’s house. I have always  understood that our Parliament and our nation will be diminished if the smaller states are  deprived of the fair-go enshrined in our constitution and in the workings of this  Parliament. 

 

 The need to negotiate, without abandoning fundamental principles, in order to get  controversial measures through the Senate, has been a strongpoint of Australia’s  democracy.  For example, it enabled me to help negotiate the Wik agreement which not  only provided an equitable outcome for indigenous Australians, but also avoided a race-based election.   

 Though the dynamics will change after 1 July, I urge the Government and all Senators to  reflect upon the importance of these functions to the health of our democracy.   

 And so to that third and final reflection on my maiden speech.   

  5

 I entered this Parliament with one fundamental objective that would guide my approach to  issues of public policy. The objective outlined in this maiden speech was:   

 ... to contribute to the development of an economic and social order in which  persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual  development and material well being in conditions of economic security and  equal opportunity.   

 I was determined to defend the uniqueness and dignity of the human person.   

 In three decades I have witnessed the encroachment of utilitarianism, crass materialism,  and moral relativism, each having negative implications for true human flourishing.   

 Against this backdrop, my approach to public policy has at times been summarily  dismissed as an attempt to legislate morality.   

 As the great Natural Law philosophers pointed out, the public policy issues of equality,  fairness, justice and the common good are indeed profoundly moral questions.  And is not  all legislation a reflection of a moral position? 

 

 I have consistently addressed matters of public policy through a rigorous analysis of  proposals against a framework of social justice principles that are able to be understood  and supported by persons of goodwill who are committed to a just, free, equal, and life-affirming society.   

 This is why I have fought for economic justice for workers and their families against the  slavery of economic rationalism.   

 It is why I have defended human dignity against the objectification of women by the  pornography industry and been involved in efforts to stop children being exposed to  pornography through the Internet.     

 It is why I have objected to the mistreatment of refugees and asylum-seekers. Recent  cases in which errors of judgement have been made and people wrongly deported have  reminded me of the case which moved me to call for a Senate Inquiry into the operation of  our refugee program. It was the forcible deportation of Zhu Quing Ping, a Chinese woman  almost nine months pregnant who was aborted on arrival under China’s coercive  population control program. We failed her and we must ensure we don't let grave  miscarriages of justice like this happen again.    

 It is why I have maintained that the true measure of our society and our civilisation is not  how rich, or powerful, or technologically advanced we are.  But simply, it is how we treat  the weakest and most vulnerable among us. 

 

 It underpins my unwavering defence of pro-life, pro-human values against the  despondency of abortion and euthanasia.   

 It motivates my criticism of the technological imperative - “what can be done should be  done”.  There is growing pressure to allow the cloning of human embryos, which is a 

  6

 direct threat to humanity itself. Even now taxpayers’ money is being used to fund  destructive experimentation on human embryos.  This imperative has re-introduced a  eugenic mentality which wrought such sorrow and destruction for a previous and not long  distant generation.   

 It inspires my support for a better deal for families, and my defence of marriage between a  man and a woman as the fundamental building block of a life-affirming society,  confidently providing for its future.   

 [ FINAL REFLECTION AND FAREWELL ]   

 

 For all of us here tonight, the title of our office and its privileges can mask the true  importance of who we are as Senators. It is the gravity of what we do and who we  represent which should humble us immensely.   

 This week I leave here for the political wilderness to spend more time bushwalking the  beautiful Tasmanian wilderness, God willing.  But I will still take a keen interest in the  decisions of Parliament. 

 

 I have devoted nearly 50 years to Tasmania and to Tasmanians. Tasmania has transformed  during my three decades in the Senate.  It is now a growing economy with unemployment  rates at last coming down. I am happy to have achieved extra funding from successive  governments for the smallest State in our Commonwealth.  As an independent I had the  luxury of always being able to put Tasmania first.   

 To those who are retiring from this Senate with me, I wish you all the best.   

 To those who will remain, and to all newcomers, I can only but echo the prayer with  which we start each day in this chamber:   

 May God continue to bless, direct and prosper your deliberations.
