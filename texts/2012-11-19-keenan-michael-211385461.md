 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling MORE THAN 10,000 ILLEGAL ARRIVALS SO  FAR THIS FINANCIAL YEAR November 19, 2012

 Labor has added to its epic failures on our borders with more than 10,000 people now arriving on illegal boats just five  months into the 2012-13 financial year, including the 72 arrivals on the latest boat, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Labor has recorded yet another astounding milestone with 10,029 people having arrived on 178 boats so far in 2012-13.  In a record year of cost and chaos, the people smugglers’ business model continues to generate record profits under  Labor’s half-hearted measures,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “More people have arrived illegally in the last six days than in the last six years of the Howard Government.  

 “As Labor asks the Australian people to sign another cheque for over $1.7 billion in the Senate today to pay for the chaos  they created on our borders, this Prime Minister and Immigration Minister continue to add to their failures in the record  books with milestone after milestone.  

 “29,940 people have now arrived illegally since Labor began to unwind the Coalition’s proven border protection policies in  November 2007.  Astoundingly, one third of those arrivals have occurred in the last five months.  

 “Only the Coalition has the proven suite of policies and the resolve to back them up and stop the boats.  Only an election  will provide Australia with a chance to fix Labor’s chaos on our borders.  Labor has proven itself quite simply incapable  and unwilling to get the job done,” Mr Morrison said.  

 Mr Keenan said: “More than 10,000 people have arrived this financial year alone - this is already more than double the  total amount of arrivals for the 2010-11 financial year.

 “There have now been more illegal boat arrivals this year than in the entire 12 years under the Howard Government.

 “The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, used to call every boat arrival under the Howard Government a policy failure; therefore  by her own standards Labor has now had more policies failures this year than the entire term of the Howard Government.

 “Labor’s failure on border protection, even by their own standards, is nothing short of catastrophic.

 “An election and a Coalition Government is what this country needs to stop the boats from coming,” Mr Keenan said.
