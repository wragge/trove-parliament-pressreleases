 PEACEKEEPERS’ CONTRIBUTION HONOURED TODAY   

 The important and ongoing contribution of peacekeepers will be honoured today on  Australian Peacekeepers’ Day, Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Alan Griffin said.     

 Laying a wreath to mark the day during a service at the proposed site of the National  Peacekeepers’ Memorial, Minister Griffin encouraged Australians to recognise the role of  peacekeepers in helping to restore peace around the world.   

 “Australia has been involved in peacekeeping operations for 62 years and there are  currently more than 1200 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed to ten  peacekeeping operations overseas,” Mr Griffin said.    

 “Peacekeepers serve in dangerous and unstable locations around the world, seeking to  restore peace and order and assisting the victims of conflict.  Today is an opportunity to  honour their valuable contribution.   

 “Australia has a proud record of peace operations over the past 62 years. More than  30,000 Australian peacekeepers have participated in some 50 United Nations and  multinational peace operations across the globe since the first operation in Indonesia in  1947.”   

 Australia’s peacekeeping roles have included military observation, logistics support,  cease-fire monitoring, landmine clearing, humanitarian aid and repatriation of refugees.   

 Australia has contributed to peacekeeping operations in the Middle East, Namibia,  Cambodia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Bougainville, East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan, the  Solomon Islands and a host of other places.   

 “Australia’s peacekeeping operations have involved men and women from the Australian  Defence Force, federal and state police forces and Australian Government agencies,” Mr  Griffin said.   

 The Australian Government is also funding a study investigating the long-term effects on  mental health and the quality of life of Defence Force peacekeepers deployed through  the 1990s to 2002. The study, funded by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, will  consider Australian involvement during this time in places such as Rwanda, Somalia,  Cambodia, Namibia, Western Sahara and East Timor and complement the current  Deployment Health Surveillance Program being undertaken by the Department of  Defence.   

 “This research will help us to better understand and respond to the future health needs  of peacekeepers and peacemakers,” Mr Griffin said.
