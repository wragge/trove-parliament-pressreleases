 TURNBULL NEEDS TO COME CLEAN OVER US AGREEMENT    

 Malcolm Turnbull needs to come clean and release details of the US-Australia  refugee resettlement agreement.    

 Labor strongly supports the US resettlement agreement but we are very concerned  about the ambiguous and uncertain comments made by Malcolm Turnbull in his  reported phone call with President Trump.     

 MALCOLM TURNBULL: “You can decide to take them or to not take them  after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you. The  obligation is to only go through the process.”    

 Labor questions Malcolm Turnbull's lack of judgement and whether his actions put  the US agreement at risk, including his comments indicating that the US did not need  to take any refugees under the deal that had been reached.    

 MALCOLM TURNBULL: “It does not require you to take any.”     

 To date no refugees have been transferred from Manus Island or Nauru to the US.    

 Malcolm Turnbull's comments also raise concern that Australia will simply take  anyone the US wants as part of the Costa Rica agreement. His comments make  clear that the two agreements are linked.    

 MALCOLM TURNBULL: “We are taking people from the previous  administration that they were very keen on getting out of the United States.  We will take more. We will take anyone that you want us to take.”    

 Anyone who resettles in Australia must pass strict health, character and security  checks that apply to any person applying for a visa to resettle in Australia.    

 Labor wants eligible refugees off Manus and Nauru and resettled in third countries  as soon as possible but Malcolm Turnbull’s mismanagement has called into doubt  the credibility of the agreements and the Government’s ability to execute them.
