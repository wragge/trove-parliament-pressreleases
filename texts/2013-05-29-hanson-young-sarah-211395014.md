 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 29 May 2013   

 Wrist x-rays that led to children in adult  prisons a thing of the past   

 The Greens have welcomed an announcement that the government will no longer use the  discredited practice of wrist x-rays to determine people’s age, a method that saw Indonesian  children locked up in adult prisons in Australia.   

 “Children are being tricked into crewing asylum seeker boats from Indonesia and, because of  the x-ray method our government used, those children were being locked up in adult prisons,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson said.   

 “The government has finally listened to the Greens and the legal community who have been  calling for this change.   

 “It is unacceptable that this unreliable and dangerous practice of using wrist x-rays to gauge age  landed vulnerable children in prisons with adults over and over again.   

 “It's also not good enough that many children have been sent back to Indonesia without a  proper apology for the serious risks they were exposed to in adult prisons.   

 “We need an appropriate administrative mechanism, with judicial review, to help determine  compensation claims and provide measures to help children recover from their time in  Australia's adult justice system.   

 “This change has come too late for those who have already suffered at the hands of the  Australian Government, but hopefully children in the future will be spared a similar fate.”
