 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 100 BOAT ARRIVALS IN 11/12 - ANOTHER  RECORD LABOR FAILURE June 13, 2012

 The arrival of the third illegal boat in a day, this time with 35 people on board, is the 100th boat this financial year, another record Labor failure on our borders, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Three boat arrivals in a day, 14 in the last 13 days and now a new milestone of Labor failure with 100 boats this financial year is indicative of a government unable and unwilling to control our borders," Mr Morrison said. 

 "This financial year’s tally of 100 boats with over 7,300 people on board shows that Labor, not just their failed policies, are the problem on border protection," he said. 

 "Labor  have  lost  so  much  credibility  and  authority  on  border  protection  that  it  is  increasingly  unlikely  that  they  could implement any measures effectively. Only a change of government can return Australia to the border protection regime that worked. 

 "This latest boat follows the recent trend of increasing arrivals at Cocos (Keeling) Island as people smugglers continue to capitalise on Labor’s failure by opening new markets as far away as India and Sri Lanka. 

 "This latest trend of arrivals in this remote area represents a whole new level of Labor failure and represents serious risks for under resources officials and communities alike," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "The latest interception has seen 100 boats arrive illegally in Australia this financial year - more than in  the last seven years of the Howard Government. 

 "Since  Labor  unwound  the  Coalition’s  tough  border  protection  policies,  they  have  allowed  330  boats  carrying  almost 19,000 people to be smuggled across our borders illegally. 

 "The people smugglers have made it clear that the Cocos Islands are now their latest destination for boat arrivals, with four interceptions since May this year. 

 "Border Protection Command currently has no presence in the area - Labor is relying on a small contingent of unequipped  AFP officers to intercept asylum seekers, despite the great personal health and safety risks to all involved. 

 "The Home Affairs Minister must immediately send Border Protection Command to assist with the situation on Cocos  Island," Mr Keenan said.
