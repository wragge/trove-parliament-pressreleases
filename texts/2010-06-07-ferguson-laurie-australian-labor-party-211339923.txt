 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services  Â 

 $926 000 to enhance Tasmanian settlement  services  7 June 2010 

 Relationships Australia delivers an innovative approach to creating dialogue between  migrants and refugees and members of the broader Tasmanian community on family  relationship issues and cultural transition, the Parliamentary Secretary for  Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, said today. 

 As part of the $926 000 settlement grants program (SGP) funding allocated to  Tasmania, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will provide more  than $85 000 to Relationships Australia to work with new arrivals on family and  relationship issues, the functioning of the family unit, and health and well-being. 

 'This project allows new arrivals to gain skills on how to maintain and strengthen their  relationships in a new country, act as a resource for family members, develop links  and friendships in the wider community and new skills in these areas,' Mr Ferguson  said. 

 As part of the project, the centre will arrange information sessions, a mentoring  program and a gala event.  

 During the 2010-11 financial year, DIAC's settlement grants program will provide  $926 000 towards nine projects which will help new arrivals to settle into Tasmania. 

 Some of the successful applicant organisations include migrant resource centres,  multicultural service agencies and community and welfare organisations.   

 'The many projects supported by the settlement grants program will help migrants  and refugees to settle successfully into their new communities, promoting social  participation and assisting in their cultural transition into Australia,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 A complete list of successful applicants in the 2010-11 funding round is available on  the DIAC website.  See: Settlement Grants Program 

 'I commend all organisations for their contribution to the successful settlement of  migrants and refugees in Tasmania,' Mr Ferguson said.
