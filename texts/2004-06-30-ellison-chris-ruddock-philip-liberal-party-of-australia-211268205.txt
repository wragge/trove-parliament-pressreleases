 NEWS RELEASE

 Mark IV:  Labor’s latest Coastguard backflip   

 Labor’s fourth Coastguard policy since October 2001 is yet another vote of no confidence by Mark  Latham and Labor in the men and women of Customs and Defence who are doing a great job as “cops  on the beat” policing our nation’s borders.   

 ï¿» Kim Beazley released Labor’s first Coastguard policy in October 2001 (costed at $895 million but  unfunded - see attached).   ï¿» Simon Crean released Labor’s second Coastguard policy in November 2002 (costed at $612  million but unfunded - see attached).    ï¿» Mark Latham released yet another version in March 2004 (uncosted and unfunded - see attached).   ï¿» Today Robert McClelland has dished up yet another reheated slice of Labor’s Magic Pudding in 

 Darwin (costing estimated at $500 million but unfunded - see attached).     

 Shortly after returning from a fact-finding trip to the United States last March, Mr McClelland  announced his uncosted and unfunded excursion into Miami Vice fantasyland (including 13 boats and  snipers dangling out of helicopters).  Embarrassingly for Labor, their desperate dash for cash has  forced Mr McClelland to abandon this flight of fantasy.      

 Mr McClelland seems not to know the law.  Customs and Defence officers already have the power of  arrest and prosecution.  They can seize goods and vessels and regularly do both.   

 Labor must now be honest with the Australian people and answer the following questions:   

 ï¿» Why should Coastguard be an operating division of the Australian Federal Police, when border  protection duties are already carried out in a highly professional and competent manner by  Customs and Defence? 

 ï¿» How exactly would this proposal improve existing arrangements?  ï¿» Labor wants to buy three more boats of the same size as the Australian Defence Force’s new  patrol boats, and five more boats of the same size as the existing Customs vessels.  Why then do  they propose to set up an entirely new bureaucracy to manage them? 

 ï¿» Why has Labor dropped its March 2004 proposal to give their Coastguard deep sea capacity?   Because they can’t afford it and know perfectly well that Defence already has this capability.  ï¿» Isn’t Labor’s latest Coastguard proposal just another attempt to force those Australians working in  maritime surveillance roles into the Maritime Union of Australia?   

 Labor maintains its meet and greet policy with unauthorised arrivals and, rather than deterring  unauthorised arrivals, it would be a very expensive water taxi service.   

 Labor’s plan would dismantle Coastwatch, a system that is working well, and create a new and  expensive bureaucracy that would inevitably divert resources away from operations.   

 Labor’s latest backflip would endanger the significantly enhanced border protection which the  Howard Government has put in place.

  Snipers and choppers  bolster ALP coastguard  Cvnthia Banham 

  Snipers trained to shoot out the  engines of suspect vessels, high-  speed helicopters armed with  machine guns, and a larger fleet  of up to 13 patrol boats would 

  form an Australian coastguard  under radical proposals to be  considered by Federal Labor’s  front bench. 

  The proposals, being prepared  by Labor’s homeland security  spokesman, Robert McClelland,  redirect a significant chunk of  the $612million Labor had  earlier allocated for the new ser-  vice to boost the number of its 

  patrol boats from 3 to 13.  Labor‘s coastguard - a central  part of its border protection pol-  icy - would have the power to 

  intercept and apprehend boats  suspected of smuggling drugs,  arms, people or terrorists.  But it has been ridiculed re-  peatedly by the Federal Govern-  ment, which has branded it a  “coastguide” involving “three  motor boats” - partly in refer-  ence to the three 80-metre patrol  boats the Opposition originally 

  intended for the new agency.  Mr McClelland recently the US  to inspect America’s powerful  coastguard. He told the Herald  yesterday his party had to 

  rework its proposal to “really  give it grunt in terms of its inter-  diction capacity”.  Labor‘s coastguard would be 

  supplemented by increasing the  number of vessels by up to 10 and  increasing the armaments on 

  board the patrol boats.  The three original patrol boats  would carry helicopters ‘‘which  are fitted at least with a machine  gun,” Mr McClelland said. 

  The helicopters would be  able to reach speeds of 100  knots - more than twice that of  the suspect boats they would be 

  pursuing.  They would carry trained  marksmen who, as in the US,  would be able to shoot the en-  gines of suspect boats. 

  “The helicopters hover above  the boats and their rifles have a  laser light onto the target exactly  where the bullet is going to hit. 

  So they’re being very precise in  just shooting a 50 d i r e  bullet  through the engine to stop  them,” he said. 

  The extra 10 patrol vessels,  which would stay close to the  coast and police Australia’s ter-  ritorial waters, would be  funded from $32 million in-  itially allocated for a fixed 

  seabed radar system.  Mr McClelland said the seabed  radar - which would have de-  tected vessels passing above it  but in a limited area - would  have been less effective than haw  ing more boats. 

  The extra boats would carry  machine guns and officers on  board would be armed.  The submissions are to be put  to a priorities review committee  of Labor‘s shadow ministry in the  next month.

  Choppers to bolster Labor’s coastguard  From Paqe 1 

  repeatedly told in the US by of-  ficials from the Joint 

  Interagency Task Force, its anti-  drug trafficking body, that  “you’re living in a dangerous  neighboulhood” because of the  quantities of drugs coming out  of South-East Asia, and the po-  tential for terrorists to use the  same organised crime net-  works. 

  Mr McClelland said he be-  lieved Australia was exposed  without a coastguard, because  of the Government’s current  reliance on the Navy to police  its waters. 

  He said the Navy was “grossly 

  1 

  over-resourced” for coastguard  work. It had no proper policing  infrastructure and its use in the  role was “like having armed  tanks do domestic policing on  the streets” 

  If political trouble flared in  Indonesia or North Korea re-  quiring the deployment of Aust-  ralia’s naval fleet, it would  “leave our borders totally ex-  posed’’, Mr McClelland said.

  Labor plans  strike- force  coast guard  Cvnthia Banham 

  The Australian Federal Police  will have on call a new fleet of  eight high-speed vessels with  25-millimetre cannons under  Labor’s revised coast guard pol-  icy, to be unveiled today. 

  Labor will also introduce a new  sea marshals program, similar to  the Federal Government’s air  marshals, which will see officers  posted at all the main sea ports  and able to board suspect ships. 

  This, with a number of other  new national security measures,  will be funded by savings made  because the coast guard vessels 

  are likely to be leased rather than  bought, and will be armed to  handle civilian law enforcement  rather than war conditions, as 

  originally planned.  The cost of the coast guard,  which has been fully costed but  was last night yet to be ap-  proved by Labor’s expenditure  review committee, is expected  to be $400 million to $500 mil- 

  lion, compared with Labor’s  original figure  of more than  $600 million. 

  The Opposition’s homeland se-  curity spokesman, Robert  McClelland, will introduce the  substantially reworked policy - a  main part of Labor’s election  border protection strategy - in  one of the country‘s most mar-  ginal seats, the Government-held  electorate of Solomon in Darwin.  Most of the planned coast guard  resources would be based in the  country‘s north. 

  Labor has dropped its plan to  _ _ _ _  3 e, n* -.:11: _ _  _ _  -L .~~ ~ 

  spenu giau million on rnree  80-metre vessels with war capa-  bilities, instead choosing a “more  bang for your buck” approach. 

  The coast guard would com-  prise three 55-metre vessels -  each with a helicopter landing 

  platform and a 6.5-metre rapid  intervention vessel - and five  35-metre vessels. All would  have cannons. 

  They would be able to travel  200 nautical miles, to the edge of  Australian waters, unlike the  80-metre boats, which would 

  have had “deep sea” capacity.  Labor says it is more economi-  cal to have more cheaper, faster  vessels with shorter ranges. 

  It has also scrapped plans to  buy three military-style helicop-  ters for the coast guard. Instead,  it is looking at leasing three  twin-engine “marinised” civ-  ilian helicopters capable of land-  ing on the larger boats, at a cost  of $30 million over four years.  This would save $72 million on  the original plan. 

  The resources of the coast  guard, which would be in ad-  dition to the existing fleet of  eight 35-metre patrol vessels op-  erated by customs, would be in-  corporated into the Australian  Federal Police, giving it a new  maritime policing capacity. 

  Mr McClelland said yester-  day that the main emphasis of  the reworked policy was “that  we’re increasing the number of  vessels to give the coast guard  broader coverage”. 

  When Labor first flagged in - - .  . . . _  . 

  March that it was considering  revising its coast guard policy,  the Government mocked it as a  “coast guide” of motor boats and  water taxis. 

  Mr McClelland said that by  incorporating the coast guard  into the AFP it would be more  effective, since officers would not  only have the power, to detain  suspeas on any detained vessels -  as customs and naval officers now  do - but would have powers of  arrest and prosecution. 

  “The coast guard is a very sig-  nificant part of our border pro-  tection strategy,” he said. “All  undesirable citizens and indeed  undesirable substances, for 

  example narcotics, all come into  Australia from overseas, so the  coast guard will be a vital part in  that border protection function.” 

  Under the plans, less money  would also be put into voluntary  coast guard organisations.  Rather than the original 

  $124 million, these groups will  now get $80 million to provide  training and support to volun-  teers and for volunteer vessels,  and to carry out search and  rescue operations and help  boats in trouble. 

  Labor will also allocate  $31.5 million over four years to  develop an Australian coast  guard regional maritime intelli-  gence co-operation network. 

  The Australian coast guard  will work with a  US coast guard  force, the Joint Interagency Task- 

  force West, as well as authorities  in South-East Asia to share intel-  ligence and coastal surveillance.

  Labor’s   $612m bid 

  to guard coastlirk   Annabel Crabb Canberra   ” 

  WHATTHECOASTGUARDCOStS 

  A Labor federal government   would devote $612 million to   protecting the Australian coast-   line against drug-runners,   people-smugglers and illegal   fishing boats, Opposition Leader   Simon Crean said yesterday. 

  Three new purpose-built   boats would guard the coast   and $125 million would be spent   on encouraging boat owners   operating off the northern coast-   line to look out for “unusual 

  activity”.   Defence Minister Robert Hill   branded the proposal “a re-run   of one of the few policies that Mr 

  Beazley took to the last elec-   tion”.   “It’s just adding another layer   of bureaucracy and extra admin-   istrative costs. That’s what were   trying to avoid,” Senator Hill   said. 

  “We’re trying to get the 

  money into the sharp end.   Already we’re committed to a   new fleet of patrol boats . . . if   you go downmarket, so to speak, 

  and buy smaller, less capable   ships, you won’t have that range   of capabilities that a force like   ours needs.” 

  Labor’s new coast guard fleet   would have three new 80-metre   vessels, costing $180 million   over four years. 

  Mr Crean, who launched the   policy in Brisbane yesterday with 

  (over four years)   Patrol vessels $180 million 

  Fuel, ammunition etc   Additional personnel   g;; do; 

  Helicopters $75 milljon 

  Volunteers $88 million 

  Volunteer vessels $36.5 million   Fixed seabed array $30 milljon   Administration, start-up $15 million   TOTAL $612 million 

  community security spokesman   Mark Latham, said the “amazing   thing about this country is that   we’re the biggest island co_nti-   nent but we have no maritime   policing authority, no cop :on   the beat”. 

  Labor says its plan is r&r-e   economical than using tivy   frigates to patrol the entire   coastline. 

  Mr Crean said: “The problem   at the moment is that the pat$ol   boats that the navy uses can’t go   out into the blue water and if you   send the frigates out there they   cost a fortune; a million dollars a   day. 

  “So there will be a commit-   ment to boats, there will be   people to man them a’nd 

  there will be the commitment   to the volunteer network that   is so vital to make it work,” he   said. .> 

  The Labor plan promises a   separate intelligence capability   for the coast guard. 

  FINANCIAL REVIEW 

  ALP coastguard 

  %o cost $8!$5 m 3 

  Refugee debate Steve Lewi:; Labor yesterday confirmed plans to establish a full-time coastguard to combat the growing incidences of people smuggling in Australia’s north, as the ALP sought to deflect criticism that it has been soft on refugees. Campaigning in Perth, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, also outlined plans to introduce tougher border protection measures if he wins the election as part of a long-term sc’lution to the issue of illegal refugees. In what aould mean a dramatic shift in resources away from the Navy to the new agency, Mr BeazYley said the coastguard would offer a capacity to “patrol our borders for 52 weeks of the year”. Labor estimated the cost of lhe coastguard at $895 million over four years. All but $15 million of this funding would flow from existing Budget allocations. “This powerful new agency will allow the Navy to be used for its real purpose of naval operations. That is what the Navy is trained and equipped for,” he said.. But the Minister for Defence, Mr Peter Reith, last night criticised Labor’s plans which he said had “obvious downsides” for Aust-   ralia’s naval capability. “All he’s 

  doing is just taking the patrol boat   fleet and putting it into a new 

  operation,” Mr Reith told 7he 

  Australian .Financial Review,   He said hle had official advice that   Labor’s plans would strip resources   from the Navy. 

  But Mr Eleazley, a former defence 

  minister, said there were different   views within the military towards his   proposal.   “The United States operates on   this basis. It is a great maritime 

  nation, and we are too,” he said.   Labor’s electoral support has   fallen sharply since the Tampa   refugee drama began in August. 

  n Opposition Leader Mr Kim Beazley   plans a full time coastguard to   combat people smuggling.   n Labor’s border control plan over four 

  years will cost $895m.
