 Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and  Trade Julie Bishop  14/07/11    

 Labor must reveal negotiations with PNG over Manus Island    

 The Prime Minister must reveal key aspects of her claimed negotiations with  the Papua New Guinea government over the proposed re-opening of the  Manus Island detention centre for asylum seekers.   

 During my recent visit government officials and others in PNG raised  concerns about the approach taken by the Labor Government and its  perceived arrogance.   

 Contrary to the claims of advanced negotiations by Labor, senior PNG  officials reported that no detailed proposal had been provided to them.  The Manus Island announcement follows the Prime Minister's familiar pattern  of announcing negotiations with other countries without having detailed plans  in place.   

 The Prime Minister claimed for months to have been in negotiations with the  government of East Timor before the truth was finally revealed and the East  Timor proposal was dumped.   

 The following questions should be immediately answered by Julia Gillard to  avoid another diplomatic bungle that further damages Australia's reputation in  the region.   

 - Has the Labor government provided a formal written and costed  proposal to the PNG government?  - With whom in the PNG government is Labor negotiating?  - What is the current status of those negotiations?  - Has the Labor government contacted anyone in the Manus Island 

 provincial government?  - Has any formal written and costed proposal been provided to the  Manus Island provincial government?
