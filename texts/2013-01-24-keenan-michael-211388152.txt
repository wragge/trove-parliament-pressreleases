 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Labor hiding details on offshore interception January 24, 2013

 Today the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare has issued a vague and incomplete press release regarding asylum  seekers “boarding” a private commercial oil and gas vessel in their apparent quest to get to Australia, Shadow Minister for  Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 "It is not clear exactly what has happened, however it appears that the oil and gas vessel, the Offshore Quest, was  boarded somehow by eleven asylum seekers," Mr Keenan said.

 "The Minister needs to come clean and explain exactly in what circumstances the asylum seekers boarded the Offshore  Quest.

 “Boarding a vessel is usually terminology that is used to describe a hostile action, if this is the case then these events  need to be fully explained.

 "It is simply unacceptable that the Government refuse to supply the details of events on our borders.

 The Coalition will be requesting further details from the Minister as the Australian people deserve a full and frank account  of how Labor's border protection crisis is unfolding" Mr Keenan said.
