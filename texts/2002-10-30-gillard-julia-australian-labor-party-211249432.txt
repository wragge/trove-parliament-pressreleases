 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 BORDER 302 NOT OUT

 The Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) today announced that another 21 people from the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’ have arrived in Australia for permanent resettlement, bringing the total who have arrived here to 302 (and still to increase).

 59 per cent of those resettled so far have been brought to Australia with the Government refusing to tell the truth about its plans for further arrivals.  Once again, this highlights the costly and farcical nature of this policy and leaves a multitude of questions unanswered.

 Last year, the Prime Minister, Minister Ruddock and Minister Downer repeatedly promised the Australian people that the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’ would be a real solution and pledged that these asylum seekers would never come to Australia.

 Today’s announcement again proves that it is an unsustainable fiasco with Australia still retaining responsibility for the asylum seekers involved.

 After spending over $500 million all the Government has achieved is to delay the arrival of these asylum seekers from 2001 to 2002.

 Minister, come clean - how many asylum seekers will end up in Australia?  The Minister continues to hide behind departmental media releases and leaves it to departmental spokespeople to admit that “the resettlement of further refugees from the offshore processing centres is under consideration”.  Despite pledges that they would not come to Australia, the Government is sneaking small groups of refugees into the country bit by bit.

 The Government should work with Labor to find a lasting comprehensive solution to the asylum seeker issue - a solution that is both tough on border security and compassionate.
