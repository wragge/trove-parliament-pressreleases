 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Advisory board appointed to guide new migration agent  regulator 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today announced  the appointment of an advisory board to guide the newly established Office of the  Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA). 

 The board, which comprises a representative of the Migration Institute of Australia  (MIA), the Law Council of Australia, community and consumer advocates, will be  chaired by former lawyer and secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department,  Robert Cornall. 

 “I believe that Mr Cornall’s expertise and experience in both the public and legal  sectors will be fundamental to the success of the board, which in turn will play a key  role in the success of the new regulatory arrangements,” Senator Evans said. 

 Joining Mr Cornall on the board will be: 

 â¢ Jenni Mack, Choice Australia,  representing consumer groups and  deputy chair of the board  

 â¢ Sonia Caton, Refugee and  Immigration Legal Service,  representing the not-for-profit  immigration assistance sector  

 â¢ Glenn Ferguson, Ferguson Cannon  Lawyers, representing the Law  Council of Australia  

 â¢ Robert Stirling Henry, formerly of  Stirling Henry Migration Services,  representing the Migration Institute of  Australia  

 â¢ Andrew Holloway, Victoria University,  representing the university sector   â¢ Jim McKiernan, former senator,  representing the community sector.  

 The new Office of the MARA commenced operating as regulator of the migration  advice profession on July 1, replacing the system established in 1998 where the  profession was regulated by the MIA. 

 Christine Sykes, CEO of the Office of the MARA, and a representative from the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship will also serve on the advisory board.  Other membership may be considered by the minister from time to time. 

 Both the advisory board and the Office of the MARA were established after  recommendations of the 2007-08 Review of Statutory Self-Regulation of the  Migration Advice Profession, which found dissatisfaction amongst consumers and  potential conflicts of interest in previous arrangements. 

 The review recommended that the government establish a regulatory body separate  from the MIA to regulate the activities of the Australian migration advice profession to  provide consumers with appropriate protection and assurance. 

 "Unprofessional or unethical behaviour by migration agents can seriously impact on  the lives of people using their services and bring the profession into disrepute,”  Senator Evans said. 

 “The new office will implement the relevant recommendations of the review, remove  concerns about potential conflicts of interest and provide confidence in the regulation  of the migration agent industry.”
