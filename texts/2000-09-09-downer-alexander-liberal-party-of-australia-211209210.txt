  TRANSCRIPT of 

  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER MP   Minister for Foreign Affairs 

  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - ADELAIDE   Saturday, 9 September 2000 

  SUBJECT: Violence by West Timor militia; Assault on UNHCR ofice in Atambua;   Eurico Guterres I 

  JOURNALIST: 

  Minister, Jose Ramos Horta is saying that the militia re:sponsible for these recent   outrages in &t Timor are crossing the border. They m,ay even be based in East   Timor. What do you know about that? 

  MINISTER: 

  Well, some of them have been operating in East Timor. There are possibly around 200   militias who are more or le,ss permanently stationed in East Timor, we believe, but   we’re not quite sure, and obviously there are a large number in West Timor. The   peacekeeping force is doing what it can to try to round up the militias in East Timor   and get them disarmed but there are enormous numbers, in West Timor and I think,   frankly, the much bigger problem is in West Timor. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  We’ ve heard reports this morning from our United States bureau that the UN has   authorised a shoot-to-kill policy which is a slight, well, it’s a dramatic change from   what was in force before. What do you know about that? 

  MINISTER: 

  That isn’t a change. The United Nations mandate, the Chapter 7 mandate, given by the   Security Council at the end of last year provides for the United Nations peacekeeping   force to shoot if they are in a situation where that is necessary to enforce law and   order. 

  JOXJRNALIST: 

  Do you foresee an increase in the UN presence now thalt these incursions are more and   more - we’ve had 2 or 3 now? 

  MINISTER: 

  No, I don’t think there’s a need for an increase in the presence, but plans to downsize   the peacekeeping force relatively soon have now appropriately been put on hold. We   certainly don’t want to see the peacekeeping force reduced in size at this time.   (PTO 

  JOIJRNALIST: 

  How safe are Australians who may be in that area? 

  MINISTER: 

  Well, it’s not safe. The situation in East Timor is dangerous and obviously all   Australians who are there, and there are many there, need to be very careful. We’ve,   as a government, said on many occasions that the risks to our peacekeepers are   significant and our peacekeepers need to remain ever vigilant as indeed they are. 

  JOIJRNALIST: 

  Witlhout revealing too much about military plans and protocol, is it possible that our   people would go into West Timor at some stage to round these people up? 

  MINISTER: 

  No, look, we’re not planning to go into West Timor and you’ve got to understand   West Timor is Indonesian sovereign territory and will always remain part of   Indonesia. The responsibility for security in West Timor rests with the Indonesians   and the fact is, it is perfectly clear the Indonesian military has done an inadequate job 

  in terms of disarming the militias and disbanding the militias, and in the end,   disbanding the refugee camps. Now the events in Atambua of recent days have been a   catalyst. They have reminded the Indonesians they’ve got a lot more work to do, we   welcome the sending of additional battalions into West Timor but we’ll have to see   now the Indonesians act in a decisive way to deal with the militias and to bring to   just.ice those who are responsible for a long list of human rights abuses over a long 

  period of time. 

  JOIJRNALIST: 

  I believe there have been calls for immunity for militia leaders should they give up   some of their buddies. Wheat do you think about t.hat sort of thing? 

  MINISTER: 

  Wel:l, there’s been, as I understand it, some comments made by one of the members of   the tndonesian Human Rights Commission about witness protection for Eurico   Guterres. Well, I would only say to you, we know that Eurico Guterres has been not   just a ruthless militia leader in East Timor and West Timor for a long time, but that he 

  himself was directly involved in the events in Atambua. He has been directly involved   in many acts of violence. He was directly involved in tlhe destruction of much of the   property in East Timor after the ballot in September of last year and he is somebody   ultimately who has to be held accountable for his grotesque breaches of human rights   over a long period of time.
