 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/776 THURSDAY 19 AUGUST 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS  'Teflon John' Owes Australian Public the Truth New claims today that Miles Jordana was told in early October 2001 that photographs allegedly showing asylum seekers throwing children overboard were misrepresented support calls by the Australian Democrats for the Prime Minister to clear the way for public servants, including Mr Jordana to appear before a reconvened Senate inquiry. "In interviews yesterday, the Prime Minister once again refused to undergo a lie detector test, stating on A Current Affair last night that "They (the public) are my lie detector, they will decide my fate and nobody else and that is right in a great democracy," Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said. "If John Howard is serious about protecting democracy and allowing the Australian public to determine his fate at the polling booths, he should remove the gag on public servants and allow the truth to emerge. The Children Overboard (Certain Maritime Incident) Report 2002 found that "the Government's refusal to allow Mr Jordana to answer questions about these matters has seriously hampered the Committee's ability to discharge fully its obligation to the Senate in this regard."  "'Teflon John' should not hide behind senior public servants. If the Australian public are to make a well-informed decision on polling day this year, they are entitled to a complete version of events. They are entitled to the truth."
