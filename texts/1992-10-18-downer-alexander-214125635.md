 ALEXANDER DOWNER MEMBER FOR MAYO SHADOW  MINISTER FOR DEFENCE

 A STRONG AUSTRALIA

 The Federal Coalition today launched the most comprehensive  statement on the future direction of Australian defence since  1987 and the most comprehensive ever made by an Opposition in  Australia.

 The statement was the result of an extensive review which was  established by Opposition Leader John Hewson early last year.

 Shadow Minister for Defence Alexander Downer said at the launch  in Canberra today that the historic changes in international  security and the serious deterioration of the Australian economy  meant that the foundations of Labor's current defence policy - 

 the 1987 White Paper - had simply collapsed.

 Mr Downer outlined some of the highlights of the policy at a 

 Press conference in Canberra.

 Co-operative Regional Defence

 The Coalition regards the upgrading of Australia's security  arrangements with its neighbours as a central priority for the  policy.

 "The Asia-Pacific region is at an historic crossroads. If we can  develop effectively a web of bi-lateral and multi-lateral  security and defence ties then the peaceful regional environment  we currently have will be here to stay", Mr Downer said.

 "If we ignore this opportunity then unexpected regional changes  could pull countries further apart".

 The Coalition's policy of Co-operative Regional Defence places  particular emphasis on Australia's defence relations with the  South West Pacific and the ASEAN countries as well as encouraging  the United States to retain an active security role in the 

 region.

 "We have to understand that Australia's own security is only  likely to be threatened if there is a breakdown in the security  of our region. Co-operative Regional Defence is about making  sure that does not happen.

 "In detail, the Coalition will increase training and joint  exercises with our neighbours; develop co-operation in areas such  as maritime surveillance, patrolling (including of EEZs), piracy,  drug running and refugee movements; steps will be taken to 

 encourage greater co-operation between regional defence  industries.

 "There also needs to be transparency in regional defence policies  in order to build mutual confidence", Mr Downer said.

 The Defence of Australia

 The Coalition's policy recognises the primary responsibility of  the Federal Government to provide for the direct defence of  Australia. v

 "Our defence policy will develop maximum flexibility to deal with  unexpected contingencies. That includes maintaining and  modernising an effective strike capability well into the next  century as well as enhancing the mobility and flexibility of the  A D F .  .

 Out of both recurrent spending and the $27 billion to be spent  on capital equipment over the next decade (of which around $9  billion has yet to be committed) the Coalition's highest 

 priorities will be:

 .  increasing spending on flying hours, sailing days and  exercises and training for the ADF;

 .  Airborne Early Warning aircraft to compliment the 

 /' Jindalee Over the Horizon Radar system;

 .  improved minehunting and minesweeping capability for the  navy; .

 .  additional troop mobility and heavy lift helicopters;

 .  the abolition of the Ready Reserve and the return to a 6  regular battalion structure;

 .  the creation of a regular commando company.

 The Coalition will postpone the purchase of a helicopter support  ship and downgrade the Leopard tanks in order to divert resources  to areas of higher priority.

 Budget

 The Coalition will make a range of savings by reducing the 

 defence bureaucracy, cutting overheads and reversing a range of  wasteful decisions recently made by Labor.
