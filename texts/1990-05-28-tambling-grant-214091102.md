 ILLEGAL FISHERMEN AND BOAT PEOPLE FORCE REVIEWS

 The apprehension of foreign vessels off northern Australia  this financial year would cost taxpayers more than $25  million, the Shadow Minister for Regional Development,   External Territories and Northern Australia revealed today. ' .  â   ’  '  5  '  â   â   I .  â  

 Senator Grant Tambling attributed the cost to increasing  numbers of Indochinese boat people seeking refugee status as  well as continued incursions by illegal Indonesian fishermen  into the Australian Fishing Zone. ,  .

 "The humanitarian and budget demands of boat people and ,   illegal fishermen are of such magnitude that the Federal  Government needs to urgently review its policies in relation  to immigration and inter-departmental planning.

 "The;weakness of its approach was demonstrated by Labor  Senator Nick Bolkus today when he was unable to tell me how  the Hawke Government:was preparing for the anticipated ,   increase in Indochinese boat people, other than by granting 

 Indonesia $1.5 million to upgrade refugee camp facilities."

 Earlier Senator Tambling told the Senate that Indonesia's  main refugee camp on Galang Island was overcrowded with more  than 11,000 Vietnamese and Cambodian people and that the  Indonesian ^Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, had been quoted as 

 saying that his country would help boat people continue their  voyage.  :  ’

 "My discussions with senior officers in the recent Senate  Estimates Committee hearings revealed that the resources of a  number of government departments and authorities in northern  Australia were stretched.

 "Detailed responses to my questions show that costs borne by  Immigration, Coastwatch, Customs, Primary Industries and  Defence add up to a budget requirement in excess of $25  million a year.  This figure fails to take into account the 

 anticipated increase in Indochinese boat people and the  upheaval caused by diverting government resources away from  regular duties." :  i

 Senator Tambling urged Senator Bolkus and Immigration  Minister, Mr Gerry Hand, to clarify the Federal Government's  long-term planning, including its policy on the refugee  status of Cambodians seeking asylum.
