 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION    

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED HOSPITAL,  CAMPERDOWN - TUESDAY 20 MAY 2003   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: Medicare; Polls; Woomera Detention Centre;  Indonesia/Aceh; Telstra   

 CREAN: Today, I had the opportunity to visit the emergency  department of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  I am very impressed with the  work and the dedication that they do.   

 It’s a very interesting story that they tell - that their admissions have been  going up, in essence, because people are coming to them who could have  been treated by doctors.  They’re not going to doctors, because they can’t  afford to.  They can’t afford to, because the doctor is no longer bulk billing.   

 We have to deal with the crisis in our health system from both ends of the  equation.  We have to properly fund the public hospital system, and the  Federal Government hasn’t properly funded the system.  It’s walked away  from an opportunity to get a new five-year agreement that would give  confidence that the public hospital system will be able to continue to grow  and to build itself.   

 It’s only Labor Governments that have ever been serious about real five-year  agreements.  Labor’s Medicare Alliance with the States will give us the  opportunity to renew that again.   

 The other advantage to public hospitals is if we can fix bulk billing, because if  we can restore bulk billing so that people can visit, confidently, a doctor - and  afford to go to a doctor - then enormous pressure comes off the public  hospital system.   

 So you can see again why Labor’s alternate policy is crucial to our health  system.  The health system is in crisis; it needs fixing.  The Howard  Government has run it down.  A Crean Labor Government will restore bulk  billing and save Medicare, and take urgent pressure off the public hospital  system.

 JOURNALIST: Have you read the papers this morning?   

 CREAN: I read the papers every morning.   

 JOURNALIST: The opinion polls?   

 CREAN: Yes, I always have a look at the opinion polls when they  come out.  I don’t take very much notice of them and I think that, when you  look at the contradictory outcomes of them today, neither should you.   

 JOURNALIST: Which one of them do you think is right?  Or are they both  wrong?   

 CREAN: I say that they’re irrelevant to the Australian people.  The  Australian people want to know how their public hospital system is going to  be fixed.  They want to know how they can get back to a doctor who bulk  bills.  They want to know that their kids can get a decent university  education, that they can get an affordable place.  They want to know that  their superannuation contributions tax is going to be cut.  They want to know  that the Murray River is going to be saved.     

 That’s what the Australian people have been interested in hearing about over  the past four days, and they’ll continue to hear a lot more about those things  - and more - over the coming months.  These are the issues that matter to  Australian people that will influence how they vote in the real poll.  They  won’t be determined by how they read today’s opinion polls.   

 JOURNALIST: One of the polls suggested you are making ground after  the Budget and in your response to the Budget.  Do you think you are making  ground?   

 CREAN: I’ve got no doubt about the fact that people have  responded to the initiatives announced by me on Thursday night.   Everywhere I’ve gone around the country - and I’ve been from one side of  the country to the other - on a whole range of different things, but everyone  is coming up positively, saying, “Good on you for what you said on Thursday  night.  We want someone to actually stand up for Medicare; someone who is  prepared to commit to saving Medicare; someone who recognises that  education and health are public goods - they’re not just private benefits;  someone who is prepared to do something to save the environment;  someone that’s prepared to do a number of things, a range of things to ease  the financial burden on families.”  And they’re very positively responding to  those initiatives.   

 JOURNALIST: One of the figures shows that more than 70% of  Australians would rather see the $4-a-week tax cut going into health and 

  2

 education.  Does that sort of figure give you any heart in terms of your  policies [inaudible]?   

 CREAN: You can never satisfy you guys, can you?  You seem to  think that politics and Australian values are determined by an opinion poll.   Well, you’re wrong.  What people want is value for money, and they want  [inaudible] invested in.  That’s why they want to save Medicare.  It’s theirs.   They’ve paid for it - paid through their taxes, paid through their Medicare  Levy.  John Howard wants to charge them a third time every time they front a  doctor.     

 The message in this inner suburban area is also pretty instructive in terms of  what’s going to happen with bulk billing.  Under the John Howard plan, there  is no incentive to bulk bill anyone over $32,300.  There is no increase in the  patient rebate under the Howard plan for them.  What does that mean?   Every time they go to a doctor, the doctor will no longer ask for the Medicare  Card, he’ll ask for their credit card.     

 He will put up the cost to every family in this country who earns more than  $32,000 a year.  And they’re not wealthy people.  They’re people struggling  to make ends meet, and they’re entitled to decent health care, affordable  health care, and they’re entitled to a doctor who bulk bills.  I’m going to make  sure they get them, and that is what matters to Australian people.   

 Of course, if you ask people if they’d like a tax cut and nothing else, of course  they’d say yes; you’d say yes.  But if you actually say to them, “Look,  Medicare needs to be saved.  Would you be prepared to forego a tax cut to  save Medicare?”, I’m absolutely convinced the majority would say they want  to save Medicare.  And that’s the plan that I’ve put forward.     

 Clearly, the Government could have given bigger tax cuts if it wanted to.  It’s  the highest taxing Government in Australia’s history.  Why shouldn’t it be able  to?  But my question is, “If you’re the highest taxing Government in  Australia’s history, how is it that you can’t afford to save Medicare?”     

 I showed on Thursday night how you can save Medicare, and I’m determined  to do it.  The first step is blocking the Government’s legislation in the  Parliament and ensuring that their new plan to destroy Medicare doesn’t get  through.  The second stage is what I’m doing now - continue to sell the  message that there is an alternative, an alternative that can save Medicare.   

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]    

 CREAN: I’ve already answered your question.   

 JOURNALIST:  On another issue, Mr Crean, are you concerned about the  latest allegations regarding the Woomera detention centre?    

  3

 CREAN:  Yes, I am very concerned. And what these allegations highlight  is what we’ve been calling for - that is, not only should Woomera have been  closed, but the running of detention centres should never be in private hands.    

 Secondly, the allegations last night are very disturbing, and the Government  has to release all of the records associated with the claims.  And they also  have to demonstrate whether these dodgy payments, as alleged, have been  made.    

 But there’s another disturbing factor in all of this, and it’s very pertinent in the  current circumstances, and they are allegations - yet again - of child sexual  abuse. These can’t be swept away. And I noticed, disgracefully, the Minister  today said that those allegations were scuttlebutt.  Well, on what basis does  he make that claim?    

 We’ve heard this Government want to sweep allegations of child sexual abuse  away before. The Australian public wants them dealt with - not swept away.  And that’s why, on Thursday night, I announced some important initiatives to  make sure that allegations of child sexual abuse are never swept away again.  If the Code of Conduct that I called for on Thursday night had been in place,  those allegations would have had to have been reported to the authorities.  That’s why you need a change of policy to ensure that these things don’t  happen again.    

 JOURNALIST:  Is Labor considering changing its stance on mandatory  detention?    

 CREAN:   No, I think it’s terribly important that we retain a capacity  to maintain people who arrive on our shores without appropriate security,  health or identity checks. My argument is that they should be processed  expeditiously so they’re not endlessly held in the detention facilities. And I  firmly believe that we can process those claims to determine the genuineness  or otherwise of their refugee status more quickly.    

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think Mr Ruddock is misleading the Australian  public about the state of out detention centres?   

 CREAN:  It would appear he is, if the allegations last night are correct. As  I understand it, his Department was denying that there were any case studies  that were alleged. But the report last night says it has them all on disk.    

 This Government today must release all of the appropriate records to back its  claim. Otherwise it can only be interpreted that it’s hiding something - hiding,  yet again, the way in which people in detention and potentially genuine  asylum-seekers are being mistreated in this country.    

 JOURNALIST:  Should there be a judicial inquiry?    

  4

 CREAN:  I think so far as the child sexual abuse allegations are  concerned, we have called for a judicial inquiry into the broader question of  child sexual abuse. So, that inquiry - if it were established - could clearly deal  with it.    

 A judicial inquiry into the allegations may be appropriate if the Government  doesn’t come clean.  It’s incumbent on it today to come clean on the records,  on the allegations, on the payments and, in particular, what the effect of the  child sexual abuse claims has been. And then I’ll think we’d make a  judgement from there.    

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think the detention centres shouldn’t be privately  run?   

 CREAN:  I think so, and that’s why I called more than twelve months ago  for it to be returned to be run by the Government. And I think that, clearly, if  these allegations are correct, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind. But,  in any event, Labor will ensure that the facilities are not run privately, but run  by the Government.    

 JOURNALIST:  [Inaudible]   

 CREAN:  That may be necessary. I think that we can make a better  judgement on that when we get the full information today, as soon as  possible, on what was alleged last night.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]  Can we trust the Government to release all  these figures, all the information?   

 CREAN:  On past performance, I think the answer to that is probably no,  because they couldn’t be trusted to release all the information on the ‘Kids  Overboard’.  It took a parliamentary process to get that information out. This  Government isn’t serious about addressing long-term problems in this  country. It prefers to hide the information. So, we’ll see what the  Government’s response is. But there are other processes that can be used -  the parliamentary ones, the calls for inquiries.  Let’s wait and see what they  come out with first.    

 JOURNALIST:  What about the refugees? Is there anything that Labor  would do for them?   

 CREAN:  Of course, I said that the expeditious processing of them…   

 JOURNALIST:  What about…[inaudible]?   

 CREAN:  I think they deserved particular attention. My call, I might say,  in January of last year - in other words almost eighteen months ago - was to 

  5

 close Woomera and to have newly arrived people in facilities that were not  run by ACM.    

 So, if we had been in Government, that issue would have been addressed  more than eighteen months ago. As for the question of the treatment of  asylum-seekers, we have put out a very comprehensive policy as to how that  will be dealt with - a more humane one and a fairer one, and a more  expeditious one. That’s what the country needs.    

 JOURNALIST:  Can I just ask you about the civil war brewing in the  Indonesian province of Aceh?  Do you think the Government could have  learnt anything or should reflect on what happened in East Timor?    

 CREAN:  I think the Government has to use what influence it has to get  the parties back to the table. The talks in Japan over the weekend broke  down and, unfortunately, we’ve seen the outcome in the last 24 hours.    

 I would urge the parties, our Government, and the Indonesian Government to  get back to the table. The Indonesian Government has put forward an  autonomy plan,  I think it’s appropriate that the Acehnese properly consider  that initiative.    

 And I think there’s also the capacity - if those things break down - that  maybe what you’ve got to do is to find a broker, something like the UN, to try  and get the parties together. I think all of these opportunities should be  investigated. We’ve got to try and stop further violence and the best way to  do that is really to get the parties talking again.    

 JOURNALIST:  Are we in any position - given the increased anti-Australian sentiment within Indonesia - for Australia to be involved?    

 CREAN:  Well, again, I think that depends on how constructive a role the  Australian Government is prepared to play. I would urge them to play that  constructive role and to try and get the parties back to an acceptable  resolution.    

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think Telstra has reasonable grounds for plans to  sack thousands of workers?    

 CREAN:  No, I don’t. But you see, Telstra is doing what John Howard is  doing to our health system and our education system. He’s increasing the  costs to you, but reducing the services. That’s exactly what Telstra is doing.    

 Telstra is putting up its charges and it’s reducing the services. It’s about time  that Telstra understood it has obligations to the whole of the Australian public  who collectively own 51% of Telstra, not just to the direct Telstra  shareholders. We are all shareholders of Telstra, and there are services in  decline. There are services that need to be built.

 And I would have thought that a responsible Government would have been  using its ownership in Telstra to ensure that those services were provided,  not overseeing and authorising cutbacks - massive cutbacks in capital works, 

 in jobs for people who do the service - at the same time as allowing Telstra  to keep putting up its charges.    

 But this is the philosophy of the John Howard Government. And I say to  people, get used to it. You’re seeing it on every front: Telstra, health,  education. That’s why the Government needs to be changed and that’s why  I’m putting forward real alternatives to secure that change - a better deal, a  new deal for Australia, a new deal for Australian families.    

 JOURNALIST:  If the remainder of Telstra is sold do you feel that these  sort of announcements will become the norm?   

 CREAN:  Of course, they will. And it’s the Government’s agenda, to  continue to sell it.  I won’t let that happen either. I am committed to ensuring  that no more of Telstra is sold and, using Government ownership in Telstra,  ensuring that people get the services they deserve - affordable and  accessible services.
