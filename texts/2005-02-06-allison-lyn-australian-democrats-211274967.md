 Mental Health Services Priority for Senate Inquiry 

 The Australian Democrats will be moving for a Senate inquiry into mental health  services when Parliament resumes this week, in addition to calling for an  independent judicial inquiry into the Cordelia Rau case. 

 "There was already an urgent need to examine the failure of mental health services  in Australia to give people with mental illness effective treatment, before the Cordelia  Rau case emerged," Democrats Leader Senator Lyn Allison said. 

 "It is bad enough that Ms Rau was being held in an immigration detention centre but  why did she spend 6 months in a womens prison before that? 

 "This case came to light because refugee groups raised the alarm but how many  mentally ill people are still stuck in prisons? 

 "State and federal governments have allowed our prisons and now our detention  centres to become the new psychiatric asylums," Senator Allison said.

 "Our National Mental Health Strategy is a sad joke. Australia spends half as much of  our health budget on mental health as comparable countries and a fraction of those  needing help receive it.

 "Very little has changed since the damning Burdekin Royal Commission more than a  decade ago. In fact there has been a nation-wide decline in psychiatric beds since  1993." 

 Some alarming statistics: - 46% of people who came out of NSW prisons in 2003 had a mental illness - 1 in 10 prisoners have had a psychotic episode 20 times the general population - 90% of women in prison had a psychiatric disorder in the 12 months before being  incarcerated - people with mental illness are more likely than the general population to be in  prison for breaching community orders or bail, and as a result of substance abuse  and family violence 

 "Prisons and detention centres are no place for people with mental illness. We need  more supported accommodation, more mental health workers, in-patient beds for the  acutely ill, a national coherent system of rehabilitation for people with psychiatric  disability and programs for mental illness that is linked with alcohol and drug  problems." 

 "An independent judicial inquiry is needed for the Rau case and DIMIAs complicity in  her treatment but the Senate should look at why our system is so badly failing the  mentally ill" said Senator Allison.
