 Death of Dr Peter Nygh MPS 54/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today he was saddened to learn of the death of Dr Peter Nygh.

 Mr Ruddock said that Dr Nygh had been a man of outstanding intellect who had selflessly contributed to Australia both through his work on various courts and tribunals and in academia.

 "My wife and I both had the privilege of being students in his law classes at Sydney University. Since that time we have had a deep respect of his knowledge of the law and in particular his involvement in family law and international law.

 "In recent years he made an outstanding contribution as Principal Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal between 1998 and 2000.

 "Our sympathies are extended to his family. He will be deeply missed by Australia's legal profession," Mr Ruddock said.
