 Government MPs mean spirit on  refugee’s bill   

 Bendigo  MHR,  Steve  Gibbons,  said  today  that  the  majority  of  Liberal  and  National   Party MP's had been miserable and mean-spirited over the Migration Amendment Bill  which the Prime Minister dumped today   

 Mr Gibbons said it was good news that the Government has now been forced to back  away from this indecent legislation.   

 "It's  good  that  there  were  some  MP's  that  were  willing  to  stand  up  with  Labor  for   decent and human values against the prime minister and the conservatives"   

 "But  it  is  deplorable  that  the  ugly  majority  of  conservatives  were  complicit  with  the   Prime  Minister  in  this  legislation  and  were  determined  up  to  the  very  end  to  ram  it   through"   

 "It was a farce for conservatives to pretend this bill was about border security. It was  about kow-towing to a foreign government and letting it usurp Australia's control over  who comes to Australia" 

 

 "It was about leaving refugees with no escape from persecution, stranding them and  debarring them from rights that are upheld by Australian courts and international law.  It was lousy legislation. It should have failed and it did"
