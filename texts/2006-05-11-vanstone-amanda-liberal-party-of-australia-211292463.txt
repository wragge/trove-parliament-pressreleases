 Minister Seeks To Strengthen Border Measures 

 11 May 2006 

 All unauthorized boat arrivals will be processed off-shore under legislation introduced to  Parliament today. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said the Australian  Government would not allow Australia’s strong border protection policies to be undermined.  

 ‘These changes send a strong message to people who want to risk their lives by travelling to  Australia illegally. In recent years we have stemmed the flow of unauthorized boat arrivals,  which has enabled us to welcome more refugees from camps throughout the world who have  been waiting years for resettlement,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘The last thing we want is to see a return of unsafe boats arriving in waves, with people  crammed in to line the pockets of people smugglers. These proposed changes will provide a  strong deterrent to those activities.’ 

 On April 13 the Government announced a decision to extend the regime which currently applies  to people who arrive on Australian islands off our coast (offshore entry people) to all  unauthorised arrivals by sea, including those on the mainland. 

 To implement this, the Government will seek to change the Migration Act through the Migration  Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. 

 ‘It means all people arriving unlawfully on the mainland by sea on or after April 13 will, after  commencement of the Bill, be subject to the new provisions - including those airlifted to  Australia at the end of their journey by sea,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘It means we can move these people to off-shore processing centres in another country outside  Australia for the processing of any claims that they are owed refugee protection. 

 ‘They will not be able to apply for a visa within Australia without the Minister’s non-compellable  personal intervention. 

 ‘This will effectively eliminate the distinction between unauthorised boat arrivals at an excised  offshore place and those who reach the mainland.’ 

 Senator Vanstone added that Australia’s tough approach to unauthorised arrivals would  continue to reflect the Government’s strong commitment to its international protection  obligations.

 ‘The offshore locations will continue to meet relevant human rights standards in providing  protection and care to people while their claims are assessed, and to people found to be  refugees awaiting resettlement or planning voluntary return to their homeland,’ Senator  Vanstone said. 

 ‘The Government’s intention is that people found to be refugees will remain offshore for  resettlement to a third country.’
