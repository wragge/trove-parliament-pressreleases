 Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs 

 Media Release 

 Local Solutions in Round Five Local Answers 

 31/07/2007 

 The Australian Government is providing $20 million in funding for 133 projects in  communities across Australia under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy  Local Answers initiative.    

 Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough, today  said these projects would build on the 480 projects already funded under previous  rounds of the Local Answers initiative.   

 "This round of Local Answers allowed for the funding of new projects, along with the  continuation of existing projects that could prove results in their local communities," Mr  Brough said.   

 "68 new projects will be funded with a $10 million investment by the Australian  Government and include projects that support building parenting skills, leadership  training and skills training for volunteers.   

 "Our $10 million investment will support the continuation of 65 existing projects that  build on mentoring and parenting programs and provide courses for at risk teenagers.   

 "The Local Answers program allows for local communities to devise solutions to local  problems and the Australian Government continues our support of these projects.   

 "This initiative is an important way in which the Howard Government gives local  organisations the opportunity to build communities from the local perspective. Programs  such as parenting programs, youth mentoring and supporting refugees have been made  possible by this initiative.   

 "The level of support to these programs is one of the dividends of the strong economic  and budget management over the past decade and is something that could be at risk  without a continued strong economy and the belief and trust the Australian Government  places in those on the local level knowing what is best suited to their community."   

 A full list of projects funded under Local Answers Round Five is attached, and can also be  found at www.facsia.gov.au/sfcs.
