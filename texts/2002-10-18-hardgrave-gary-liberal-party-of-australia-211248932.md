 MINISTER OPENS NEW MIGRANT CENTRE IN SYDNEY

 Migrant services in NSW will benefit from the opening of the Ashfield office of the NSW Migrant Resource Centres Association Inc (NSW MRCA Inc.), which will be officially opened tomorrow by the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave.

 “The centre provides initial settlement services to the Sydney metropolitan area with a focus on mid to Western Sydney,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “The NSW MRCA Inc. was established to provide services to refugee and humanitarian entrants under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS).”

 The IHSS is a program that helps humanitarian entrants rebuild their lives in Australia by providing them support designed to meet their initial settlement needs.

 “The centre benefits the migrant community by providing settlement information and case managing new arrivals to ensure they are linked to essential services such as income support, Medicare, education, employment and other services.

 “The NSW MRCA Inc. has been providing IHSS services since 1 August 2001 and now employs 23 people who provide initial settlement services to refugee and humanitarian entrants,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “Assistance is also provided by the centre to enable refugee and humanitarian entrants to find suitable longer-term accommodation.”

 Mr Hardgrave will open the Ashfield office of the NSW MRCA at 12.45pm on Saturday 19 October at 1st Floor, 27 Holden Street, Ashfield.
