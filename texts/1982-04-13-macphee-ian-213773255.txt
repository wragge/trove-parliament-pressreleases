 â¢  REPORTS OF EXTORTION AGAINST BALTIC REFUGEES

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee,  said today that a report from his Department confirmed that Ms  G K Valinskene visited Australia in December 1981. Mr Macphee  said that Ms Valinskene is a lawyer employed as a.representative  of Iniurcollegia in Lithuahia. This is a USSR government legal  organisation which deals with deceased estates.

 Two visitors from Iniurcollegia needed to talk with public  trustees and lawyers in Australia about cases in which they  were involved. During the two weeks in Australia, they visited  Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide. It would appear that 

 they were accompanied by a USSR consular official responsible  for Iniurcollegia matters who acted as interpreter.

 It was reported to me that the emigre community suspected the  lawyers were involved in foreign intelligence activities. One  Melbourne man of Baltic origins spoke with authorities about  their activities but Mr Macphee said that nothing has yet come 

 to light to substantiate these suspicions or claims of "a  campaign of terror and extortion against thousands of Baltic  and East European refugees".

 Intimidation of Australian citizens or residents and threats of  reprisal against relatives and friends in the Soviet Union were  serious accusations Mr Macphee said. If there were evidence of  initimidation or extortion in these circumstances, any future  applications for visas for similar visits would be considered  most carefully. Mr Macphee emphasised that if he received any 

 evidence of untoward activities it would be passed to appropriate  authorities for. investigation. The -Minister said that anyone who  had such evidence should come forward. ,Any information divulged  would be kept in the strictest confidence and the person's 

 anonymity; iwould -  be assured. '  -  '
