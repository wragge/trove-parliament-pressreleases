 Amnesty International Report on Australia MPS 068/2001

 Amnesty International's criticism of Australia's treatment of asylum seekers and its moves to improve the effectiveness of international treaty bodies misrepresented Australia's position, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 "Amnesty is a very worthy organisation, doing a lot of good work, but it is not always perfect," Mr Ruddock said.

 "It is wrong to assert that Australia's detention policies are arbitrary or in breach of our human rights obligations.

 "They reflect Australia's sovereign right under international law to control which non-citizens may enter our borders. Guidelines from the UNHCR specifically acknowledge the legitimacy of detention for the purposes of identification and assessment of any claims to stay."

 "The United Nations Human Rights Committee has confirmed that Australia's policy of detaining unauthorised arrivals does not breach the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)."

 The Minister said that considerable effort was put in to ensure that processing any such claims took place quickly, adding that, 80 per cent of asylum seekers arriving by boat were receiving decisions within 14 weeks of applying for protection.

 "The unfortunate reality, however, is that people found not to be refugees are prepared to use any means necessary, including violence, to place undue pressure on the Government," Mr Ruddock said.

 Mr Ruddock added that Australia's detention program was subject to extensive scrutiny and

 a number of avenues were available to detainees wishing to lodge complaints about their treatment in detention.

 "The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commonwealth Ombudsman regularly visit detention centres to investigate complaints and conduct their own enquiries and the UNHCR also has access on request and has visited detention centres on a number of occasions," the Minister said.

 "It is misleading for Amnesty to suggest that Australia was obliged to incorporate its obligations under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) into domestic law.

 "I hold an intervention power which enables me to act in the public interest to grant a visa and this approach fully meets our international obligations in this area.

 "Our obligations under the CAT or ICCPR do not extend to suspending removal proceedings should a complaint be lodged under those international instruments."

 "It is incumbent on Amnesty, when reporting on the scope of the recent Senate Inquiry into the Refugee and Humanitarian program, that it also recognise the full context of the Inquiry findings.

 "The Committee formed the view that my existing intervention power is an appropriate means through which Australia can meet its obligations under CAT and ICCPR and it also broadly endorsed the existing protection visa processing arrangements, including the role and operation of the Refugee Review Tribunal."

 The Minister added that, contrary to the Amnesty Report, he had not sought to revise international refugee standards to deter unauthorised movements of people between countries.

 "My recent announcement of a review of the domestic interpretation of the Refugees Convention is intended to improve the relevance and effectiveness of the Convention by ensuring that its provisions are applied as originally intended," Mr Ruddock said.
