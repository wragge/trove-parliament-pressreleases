 MINISTERIAL DISCRETION UNDER SECTION 417   

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION   

 Under the Howard Government, an asylum seeker whose claim has been rejected may  apply to the Minister for Immigration to be allowed to stay on the basis their case  raises unique or exceptional circumstances.    

 Currently, there is no transparency about how Ministerial discretion is used and there  have been allegations in the past of political bias in its exercise. Minister Ruddock has  used his power under section 417 of the Act to intervene in individual cases many  more times than have previous Labor Ministers.    

 There was public concern when the Minister used section 417 to allow into Australia  200 Lebanese people either associated with or members of the Israeli-backed South  Lebanese Army, some of whose members had tortured and murdered Palestinians and  non-Christian Lebanese since 1980.   Minister Ruddock admitted in April 2001 that  this decision risked bringing war criminals into the countryi.    

 Labor believes that a non-transparent process will always be a source of public  concern because of the potential for it to be misused for political or even private  advantage.  Labor will make the process transparent and ensure independent expert  advice is obtained.  Labor will refer each claim to the Asylum Seeker Claims  Processing Review Committee for advice and will publish the recommendations of  the Committee that an asylum seeker’s case raises unique or exceptional  circumstances.
