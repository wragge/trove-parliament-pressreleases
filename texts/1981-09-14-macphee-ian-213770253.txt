 66th RSL

 NATIONAL CONGRESS

 ADDRESS BY THE M INISTER  FOR

 IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 MR IAN MACPHEE

 Monday 14 September  1981

 I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON AT YOUR .

 6 6th Na t i o n a l  c o n g r e s s and welcome t h e o p p o r t u n i t y  o f t a l k i n g

 BY THE INFLUX OF NEW SETTLERS. My DEPARTMENT RECENTLY 

 ESTIMATED THAT HAD I T  NOT BEEN FOR THE IMMIGRATION PROGRAM SINCE

 19A5 Au s t r a l i a ' s p o p u l a t i o n  would now p r o b a b l y be s t i l l  l e s s

 THAN TEN MILLION PEOPLE WHEREAS WE EXPECT I T  TO PASS THE FIFTEEN 

 MILLION MARK IN 1 9 8 2 ,  -

 A t the present  t i m e  the Government  i s r e v ie w in g  Au s t r a l i a ' s 

 migrant  s e l e c t io n  system  -  NUMAS. Th i s  review  flows from the 

 Government ' s undertaking  at the last  e l e c t i o n , and a 

 commitment  made at the t im e  NUMAS was intr o d u c ed , to review  the

 SYSTEM AFTER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF OPERATION,

 The OBJECTIVE OF the review  i s to ensure  that  our s e le c tio n

 SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE US WITH MIGRANTS WHO CAN SETTLE  

 EASILY AND MAKE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMIC AND  

 CULTURAL LIFE OF AUSTRALIA.

 Last week I ta b le d  in the Pa r lia m e n t  the Report  of an 

 I ndependent  Co m m itte e  which  I had e s t a b l is h e d  to report  to

 ME ON THE VIEWS OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS ON THE FINDINGS  

 OF A NUMBER OF STUDIES TAKEN ON THE OPERATION OF NUMAS.

 The Co m m i t t e e ' s f i n d i n g s  are p r e s e n t l y  under  a c t i v e  c o n s i d e r a t i o n ,

 I INDICATED LAST WEEK THAT I EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE  

 A NEW MIGRANT ENTRY POLICY DURING THE PRESENT PARLIAMENTARY  

 SITTINGS,

 When the p r e s e n t  NUMAS system  was in t r o d u c e d  by my predecessor  

 in 1978 H e i n d i c a t e d  t h a t t h e p o l i c y  was b a s e d on a s e t of 

 n i n e  p r i n c i p l e s . An i m p o r t a n t  f i n d i n g  of t h e Co m m i t t e e  of 

 Re v i e w  was t h a t , on t h e w ho le, t h e r e was g en er a l  ag r e e m e n t

 IN THE COMMUNITY WITH THESE NINE PRINCIPLES,

 I n  the com ing  weeks  I w i l l  be a s k in g  the Government  to c o n s id e r

 VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT SELECTION SYSTEM. I t 

 IS NOT MY INTENTION HOWEVER TO ALTER THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE  

 POLICY IS BASED, ,

 Today , however , I would  l i k e  to spend  some t i m e  on one of the

 IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES WHICH WAS EXPOUSED AT THAT TIME AND WHICH  

 IS NOW A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF OUR POLICY. THIS IS THE  

 PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION -  THE PRINCIPLE OF APPLYING OUR  

 IMMIGRATION POLICY CONSISTENLY TO ALL APPLICANTS REGARDLESS OF  

 THEIR RACE, COLOUR, NATIONALITY, DESCENT, NATIONAL OR ETHNIC  

 ORIGIN, RELIGION OR SEX,

 I DO SO BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF NON-DISCRIMINATION HAS BEEN THE  

 SUBJECT OF SOME DISCUSSION BY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE RSL  

 AS WELL AS IN THE WIDER COMMUNITY. As RECENTLY AS THE WEEKEND  

 THE SUBJECT OF MIGRATION HAS FIGURED PROMINANTLY IN A CURRENT  

 AFFAIRS TELEVISION PROGRAMME AND IN A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER.

 The f i g u r e s show t h a t t h e g r e a t m a j o r i t y  of n o n- Europea n m i g r a n t s 

 to Au s t r a l i a  come from As i a . Those who c r i t i c i s e  t h e no n-

 we sh oul d n o t be r e c e i v i n g  m i g r a n t s from As i a . M y remarks  

 t h i s  afternoon  w i l l  th e r e f o r e  cen tr e  on t h e q u e s t io n  of As i a n

 MIGRATION.

 A GOOD DEAL OF THE C RITIC ISM  OF OUR NON“ DI SCRI MINATORY POLICY  

 STEMS FROM INTOLERANCE. I t I S ,  I BELIEVE, DIFFICULT TO ATTEMPT  

 TO CHANGE ATTITUDES,WHEN THIS IS THE CASE, CERTAINLY IT  IS NOT  

 POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THEM OVERNIGHT.

 Ne v e r t h e l e s s  much of t h e c r i t i c i s m  stems  from an in a c c u r a t e

 UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION AND IT IS HERE THAT COMMUNITY  

 LEADERS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN HELPING PEOPLE OVERCOME  

 THEIR FEARS.

 Some people  seem  to fear  t h a t  we are b e i n g  " swamped " by people

 COMING FROM ASIA. I THINK THIS IS HARDLY THE CASE. A t THE 

 TIME OF THE LAST CENSUS THE ASIAN BORN POPULATION OF AUSTRALIA  

 WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 2 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL. AND LOOKING  

 AT THE FUTURE D r CHARLES PRICE OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL

 Un i v e r s i t y  has shown t h a t , i f  Au s t r a l i a  were to ad opt  a t o t a l

 IMMIGRATION PROGRAM OF A NET 7 0 ,0 0 0  POPULATION GAIN A YEAR,

 WITH 50% COMING FROM ASIA OVER THE NEXT 30 YEARS, AUSTRALIA'S  

 POPULATION WOULD STILL BE ABOUT 90% EUROPEAN AT THE END OF  

 THAT PERIOD.

 Over the l a s t  twelve  months  less  than  a quarter  of our t o t a l

 INTAKE OF MIGRANTS WAS FROM ASIA. I t WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS  

 THAN THE PERCENTAGE FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IRELAND (28.5%) 

 AND NOT A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THE NUMBER COMING FROM NEW

 Ze a l a n d  alone (18,5%)

 Some p e o p le  seem to assume a l s o t h a t t h e p e o p l e s  of As i a  are

 CLAMOURING TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY. BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS OTHERWISE "  

 IN MANY COUNTRIES THERE IS LITTLE INTEREST ABOUT MIGRATING TO

 Au s t r a l i a  and we r e c e i v e  few a p p l i c a t i o n s . Japan and I n d o n e s i a  

 ARE GOOD EXAMPLES OF T H IS . I n THE 11 MONTHS JULY 1980/MAY 1981 

 WE RECEIVED 1,727 APPLICATIONS FROl^ INDONESIA -  JUST 0,5% OF OUR 

 TOTAL APPLICATIONS FOR THAT PERIOD AND 605 FROM JAPAN -  ONLY '

 0.2%,

 Some p e o p le  a ls o sa y t h a t we somehow favour m i g r a n t s  from As i a , 

 However t h e p r i n c i p l e s  of no n- d i s c r i m i n a t i o n  also means t h a t As i a n s

 ENTERING AUSTRALIA HAVE TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AS ANYBODY ELSE.

 There i s no p r e f e r e n c e  d e s p i t e  t h e g o s s i p . Those who e n t e r as

 REFUGEES FROM I nDO"ChINA ARE CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE SAME  

 CRITERIA AS WE APPLY TO REFUGEES WHO COME FROM EASTERN EUROPE,

 Those who e n t e r as m i g r a n t s  have to m e e t the same c r i t e r i a  as

 MIGRANTS FROM ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD,

 i

 !

 W e are not th e r e fo r e  t a k i n g  As i a n  m ig r a n t s  out of some sense  of

 OBLIGATION BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE A POSITIVE  

 CONTRIBUTION TO'AUSTRALIA'S PROGRESS,

 Wh i l e  Au s t r a l i a  does  not have  a d i s c r i m i n a t o r y  p o l i c y  on. the

 GROUNDS OF RACE WE DO HAVE A HIGHLY SELECTIVE POLICY. I t IS 

 SELECTIVE ON THE GROUNDS OF EDUCATION, SKILLS, JOB EXPERIENCE,  

 SETTLEMENT POTENTIAL AND THE LIKE. WlTH OVER A MILLION ENQUIRIES  

 A YEAR ABOUT MIGRATING'TO AUSTRALIA WE CAN AFFORD TO BE  

 SELECTIVE AND WE ARE. As I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS  

 THE CURRENT REVIEW OF NUMAS IS AIMED AT ENSURING THAT OUR  

 SELECTION SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE US WITH MIGRANTS WHO CAN  

 SETTLE EASILY AND MAKE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA.

 Some peo ple  have  also  reasoned  t h a t  bec ause  of e x p e r ie n c e s  i n

 OTHER COUNTRIES -  PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN -  WE SHOULD REVERT TO  

 A DISCRIMINATORY POLICY. WHAT THEY FAIL TO REALISE HOWEVER IS  

 THAT THE CAUSE OF SUCH DISTURBANCES ARE NOT RACIALLY BASED. ÎªÎÎÎ¥  

 ARE PRIMARILY EXPRESSIONS OF DISCONTENT OVER PEOPLES',  

 PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLES', ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS.

 They also  f a i l  to r e a l i s e  t h a t  Au s t r a l i a  i s  i n  a very  d i f f e r e n t

 POSITION FROM BRITAIN SINCE WE HAVE SELECTIVE IMMIGRATION WITH  

 INTAKES DETERMINED BY AUSTRALIA'S ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY. W e ALSO 

 HAVE WELL DEVELOPED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE ENGLISH  

 LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION AND ORIENTATION PROGRAMS TO NEWLY ARRIVED  

 MIGRANTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL-.INTEGRATE INTO AUSTRALIAN  

 SOCIETY.

 There  have  been  Press  Reports  r e c e n t l y  t h a t  the Government  i s  

 TRYING TO RECRUIT 3 0 ,0 0 0  VIETNAMESE MIGRANTS, BUT THIS IS SIMPLY  

 NOT THE CASE. LET ME CLARIFY WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE  

 NEGOTIATIONS WHICH OFFICIALS OF MY DEPARTMENT HAVE RECENTLY HAD

 in Ha n o i . H e have  been  t r y i n g  to n e g o t i a t e  an agreement  w it h  

 Han oi  whereby  Vie t n a m e s e  may be r e u n i t e d  w it h  t h e i r  f a m i l i e s  in 

 Au s t r a l i a  i n  accordance  w it h  our normal  m i g r a t i o n  rules .. H e are 

 not i n t h i s  case  t a l k i n g  about  a r efugee  program .

 H e  are t a l k i n g  about  a m ig r a t io n  program  i n v o l v i n g  people  who

 HAVE VERY CLOSE FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA AND WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR  

 OUR NORMAL FAMILY REUNION PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY  

 WOULD SERIOUSLY WANT TO DENY AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS THE RIGHT TO  

 BRING THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN TO LIVE IN AUSTRALIA.

 IF AGREEMENT IS REACHED THE RATE OF ARRIVAL WOULD DEPEND ON HOW  

 QUICKLY PEOPLE CAN BE PROCESSED. CLAIMS THAT I SENT PEOPLE TO

 Vie t n a m  "to r e c r u i t  3 0 ,0 0 0  V ie t n a m e s e  m i g r a n t s " a r e, q u i t e

 SIMPLY, NONSENCE. ÎªÎÎ NUMBERS OF CLOSE RELATIVES INVOLVED  

 ARE VERY MUCH LESS THAN THAT NUMBER.

 I n  t h i s  regard  you may have seen  from my p u b l i c  sta t e m e n t s  I

 HAVE BEEN CONCERNED RECENTLY ABOUT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF  

 PEOPLE LEAVING VIETNAM WHO ARE NOT REFUGEES IN THE STRICT U.N.

 DEFINITION OF THE TERM. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO TAKE CONSIDERABLE  

 RISKS TO LEAVE VIETNAM AND THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO, IF  THEY RETURNED

 to Vie t n a m , would  almo st  c e r t a i n l y  face  some k i n d  of r e t r i b u t i o n .

 I AM LOOKING, IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHERS, FOR WAYS OF DETERRING  

 THESE PEOPLE FROM LEAVING. I DO NOT SEE THE RESETTLEMENT OF

 Vie tn a m e s e  r ef u g ees  i n  t h i r d  c o u n t r ie s  as an open  ended  back door

 MIGRATION PROGRAM BUT AS A SHORT TERM NECESSITY TO HANDLE A  

 PARTICULAR PROBLEM. VIETNAMESE MIGRANTS WILL BE WELCOME IN THIS  

 COUNTRY BUT THEY MUST BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE SAME CRITERIA AS  

 APPLY TO OTHERS -  NO MORE AND NO LESS.

 Recen tly  some pe o p le  have  suggested  t h a t  we should  have  a

 REFERENDUM ON THE QUESTION OF ASIAN MIGRATION. THIS SEEMS TO ME  

 TO SHOW A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ON THE ROLE OF THE REFERENDUM

 i n  Au s t r a l ia n  p o l i t i c a l  l i f e . The referendum  e x i s t s  e s s e n t i a l l y

 TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION. AUSTRALIANS  

 HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY EVERY THREE YEARS TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINION  

 ON THE POLICIES BEING FOLLOWED BY A PARTICULAR GOVERNMENT. I f 

 THEY DISAGREE WITH THOSE POLICIES THEY CAN VOTE THAT GOVERNMENT  

 OUR OF OFFICE AND REPLACE IT BY ONE OF THEIR LIKING.

 Al l major  p a r t i e s  have  e x a m in e d  t h i s  q u e s t io n  very  thoroughly

 AND HAVE CHOSEN TO SUPPORT A NON~D I SCR I MINATORY POLICY. I t WAS 

 NOT SEEN TO BE NECESSARY IN 1901 TO HAVE A REFERENDUM WHEN A  

 DISCRIMINATORY POLICY WAS INTRODUCED AND I SEE NO REASON TO HAVE  

 HAD ONE WHEN IT  WAS ABOLISHED.

 Sin c e  1973 both Labour an d Li b e r a l  Co u n tr y  Pa r ty Go v e r n m e n ts

 RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, SOME OF WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST TO  

 CRITICISE US FOR DOING WHAT THEY DO, . BUT I DON'T THINK WE  

 SHOULD DEBASE OURSELVES TO THEIR LEVEL, SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO  

 ARGUE THAT THE EXISTENCE OF EVIL ELSEWHERE SOMEHOW JUSTIFIES

 "As FOR RACIALISM, LET ME BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IN  

 EARLIER TIMES AUSTRALIAN LIFE WAS SERIOUSLY MARRED IN THIS

 from Th i r d  World  Co u n t r i e s , W e have  moved  a long way from

 BEING AN ESSENTIALLY A nGLO"SaXON"CeLTIC COMMUNITY TO BEING A  

 TRULY MULTICULTURAL AND MULTI-RACIAL ONE."

 Au s t r a l i a  i s  not s e e k i n g  d i v e r s i t y  j u s t  for i t s  own s a k e . I n

 A POSITIVE SENSE, WE HAVE MUCH TO GAIN FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

 Cu l t u r a l l y  p e o p l e  from As i a  b r i n g  w i t h them the r i c h n e s s  and

 SOPHISTICATION OF HISTORIC C I V IL IZ A T I O N S , COMMERCIALLY THEY  

 BRING SKILLS AND THEY ESTABLISH BUSINESSES WHICH CREATE JOBS

 for oth er Au s t r a l i a n s . You ha v e only to c o n s i d e r  the

 POPULARITY OF ASIAN CUISINE IN AUSTRALIA TO SEE THE TRUTH OF  

 TH IS ,

 Au s t r a l i a , t o d a y , is a m u l t ic u l t u r a l  s o c i e t y . As a people

 WE HAVE BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THE DIFFERENT CULTURES AND  

 NEW IDEAS THAT NEW SETTLERS HAVE BROUGHT WITH THEM. I t IS 

 THE SHARING OF THESE CULTURES AND IDEAS WHICH FORMS THE CORE  

 OF OUR MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY WHICH WE NOW SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE  

 UPON.

 The s o c i a l  u n d e r p i n n in g  the Go vernment  p r o v id e s  through  a range

 OF SETTLEMENT PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY IN THE EDUCATION FIELD, IS  

 AN ESSENTIAL PILLAR OF MULTICULTURAL!SM. ÎªÎÎ THREAT TO SOCIAL  

 COHESIAN IN AUSTRALIA COMES NOT FROM IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE  

 DIFFERENT BUT FROM PEOPLE WHO CANNOT ACCEPT DIFFERENCE IN OTHERS.

 I BELIEVE THAT WE NO LONGER SEE OURSELVES AS AN OUTPOST OF

 Europe  w h ic h  i s  content  to huddle  as a small  n a t io n  i s o l a t e d

 FROM THE GREAT CONTINENT OF ASIA NEARBY. INCREASINGLY WE ARE  

 FORGING LINKS WITH THOSE COUNTRIES AND THE PROSPECTS ARE  

 ENORMOUS AND EXCITING.

 The As i a n / P a c i f i c  economic  r e g io n  i s  t h e  f a s t e s t  growing  in the 

 w or ld . The success  s t o r ie s  -  J a p a n , Ko r ea , Ta i w a n ; Hong Kong, 

 Singapore  -  are our near n e ig h b o u r s  and th e y  are v i t a l  for u s , . 

 I n  1 9 S 0/8 1  nea r ly  50% of our e x p o r t s  went to As i a  and over  a

 THIRD OF OUR IMPORTS CAME FROM THAT REGION. OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE  

 IS CLOSELY TIED TO THESE COUNTRIES AND THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED.

 WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD STRONG ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LINKS  

 WITH THEM.
