  POPULATION, SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY 

  15 NOVEMBER 1999 

  THE HON. PHILIP RUDDOCK, MP   MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION & MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS 



  Attachment A 

  BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 

  THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO ADDRESS THIS   ‘POPULATION, 

  SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY’ FORUM. 

  THE BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA HAS A WELL RECOGNISED AND 

  ENDURING INTEREST IN THIS POLICY AREA 

  > IN FACT A PERUSAL OF OUR DAILY NEWSPAPERS IN ANY GIVEN WEEK 

  WILL ATTEST TO THIS. 

  YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ON ISSUES INCLUDING 

  MIGRATION PROGRAM NUMBERS AND POPULATION POLICY ARE A CREDIT 

  TO YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT PUBLIC DEBATE. 

  BUT I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT WE NOW PROGRESS THE DEBATE ON THESE 

  ISSUES AND BROADEN THEIR CURRENT NARROW FOCUS. 

  > WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THE CURRENT FOCUS ON PERMANENT 

  RESETTLEMENT NUMBERS AND POPULATION TARGETS. 

  THIS FOCUS IS OUTMODED AND UNPRODUCTIVE AND IGNORES THE 

  REALITY OF TODAY’S GLOBALISED ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND LABOUR 

  MARKET. 

  IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THERE IS OFTEN LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE 

  BETWEEN A SKILLED ENTRANT WITH A PERMANENT VISA OR A LONG-TERM 

  TEMPORARY VISA 

  Page 1 of 20 

  THE FACT IS HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND 

  HIGHLY MOBILE - THEY WILL GO TO WHATEVER JOB AND WHATEVER 

  COUNTRY OFFERS THEM THE BEST OVERALL RETURNS ON THEIR SKILLS. 

  TODAY I WILL OUTLINE HOW LONG-TERM SKILLED TEMPORARY MIGRATION 

  HAS BECOME A CORE ELEMENT OF AUSTRALIA’S IMMIGRATION PROGRAM. 

  “r AND HOW WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES IT 

  PROVIDES TO SECURE AND ENHANCE OUR NATIONAL FUTURE. 

  THE IMPORTANCE OF IMMIGRATION 

  BUT FIRST LET ME REAFFIRM MY GOVERNMENT’S SUPPORT FOR 

  IMMIGRATION AND RECOGNITION OF ITS KEY ROLE IN THE BUILDING OF 

  MODERN AUSTRALIA. 

  OVER THE LAST FIFTY-FIVE YEARS AUSTRALIA’S IMMIGRATION 

  PROGRAM HAS DELIVERED ALMOST 6 MILLION MIGRANTS TO 

  AUSTRALIA. 

  THIS ACCOUNTED FOR ALMOST HALF OF AUSTRALIA’S TOTAL 

  POPULATION GROWTH DURING THIS TIME - FROM AROUND 7 MILLION 

  AFTER WORLD WAR TWO TO OUR RECENTLY REACHED MARK OF 19 

  MILLION. 

  I’M SURE YOU WOULD ALL AGREE THAT IMMIGRATION HAS 

  PROVIDED MORE TO AUSTRALIA THAN SIMPLY HEADS TO BE 

  COUNTED AT CENSUS TIME, OR A STIMULUS TO CONSUMER 

  DEMAND. 

  h IT HAS HAD A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON ALL ASPECTS OF OUR 

  SOCIETY. 

  Page 2 of 20 

  ASIDE FROM OUR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, ALL OTHER AUSTRALIANS 

  ARE IMMIGRANTS, OR THE NOT TOO DISTANT DESCENDANTS OF 

  IMMIGRANTS. IT LOGICALLY FOLLOWS THAT IMMIGRATION IS PART 

  OF OUR NATIONAL CULTURE. 

  > OUR OPEN AND WELCOMING SOCIETY HAS BEEN BUILT AND 

  REINFORCED BY OUR RICH MIGRATION EXPERIENCE. 

  FROM A COUNTRY OF LARGELY ANGLO-CELTIC ORIGIN WITH A RURAL 

  ECONOMY, POOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND FEW INTERNATIONAL LINKS, 

  WE HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO AN OPEN AND VIBRANT NATION 

  WITH A STRONG ECONOMY, AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND 

  COHESIVENESS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. 

  WE CAN SAFEGUARD AND EXTEND MIGRATION’S LEGACY - I BELIEVE 

  WE HAVE A DUTY TO DO SO. I 

  > BUT THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE IF OUR MIGRATION PROGRAM IS 

  APPROPRIATELY MANAGED AND STRUCTURED. 

  COALITION IMMIGRATION REFORMS 

  IN 1996 THE COALITION INHERITED A MIGRATION PROGRAM COMPLETELY 

  OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE NEW REALITIES AND NEEDS OF CONTEMPORARY 

  AUSTRALIA. 

  UNDER THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OUR MIGRATION PROGRAM HAD 

  BECOME LITTLE MORE THAN A FAMILY REUNION PROGRAM, WITH CERTAIN 

  CATEGORIES - SUCH AS SPOUSE REUNION - SUBJECTED TO OUTRAGEOUS 

  LEVELS OF ABUSE. 

  Page 3 of 20 

  > THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION IMMIGRATION’S PURPOSE WAS LOST AND 

  ITS RATIONALE INADEQUATELY EXPLAINED. 

  FROM A BROAD ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION, THE 

  AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE’S GOODWILL TOWARDS IT WAS RAPIDLY ERODING. 

  > SADLY, IN A SMALL MINORITY, PREJUDICES UNWORTHY OF 

  AUSTRALIANS WERE ALSO FOSTERED. 

  THIS HAD TO BE ADDRESSED. 

  EXTENSIVE REFORMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED THAT NOT ONLY RESTORE 

  THE PROGRAM’S INTEGRITY, TRANSPARENCY AND RELEVANCE, BUT ALSO 

  ENSURE IT IS UNEQUIVOCALLY IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST. 

  THESE REFORMS INCLUDE: 1 

  > THE PROMOTION OF MORE OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR POPULATION 

  TRENDS AND PROSPECTS 

  ‘r EXTENDING OUR COMMITMENT TO GENUINE REFUGEES AND OTHERS IN 

  HUMANITARIAN NEED. 

  r MARKEDLY STRENGTHENING PROVISIONS TO COMBAT UNLAWFUL 

  ARRIVALS. 

  r LAUNCHING THE SUCCESSFUL ‘LIVING IN HARMONY’ CAMPAIGN. 

  g REDEFINING THE PIVOTAL CONCEPTS OF MULTICULTURALISM AND 

  CITIZENSHIP. 

  Page 4 of 20 

  BUT IT IS OUR WORK IN REBALANCING THE MIGRATION PROGRAM BETWEEN 

  THE FAMILY AND SKILL STREAMS, AND MORE EFFECTIVELY TARGETING 

  SKILLED MIGRANTS WHICH HAVE HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT. 

  > THIS IS A REFORM OF PART 

  COMMUNITY. 

  ICULAR RELEVANCE TO THE BUS 

  SKILLED MIGRATION 

  INESS 

  IN 1995-96 THE FAMILY STREAM COMPRISED AROUND 70 PER CENT 

  OF THE MIGRATION PROGRAM, WITH SKILLED MIGRATION BARELY AN 

  AFTERTHOUGHT. 

  THIS IMBALANCE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED, WITH SKILL STREAM VISAS 

  INCREASING FROM 29 PER CENT IN 1995-96 TO OVER 50 PER CENT IN 

  1998-99. . 

  AUSTRALIA IS NOW ATTRACTING BETTER-EDUCATED, YOUNGER, 

  MORE JOB-READY MIGRANTS WITH THE LANGUAGE SKILLS TO 

  OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY 

  THERE IS MOUNTING EVI 

  EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 

  f IN THE AUSTRALIAN WORKPLACE. 

  DENCE OF THE ECONOMIC, BUDGETARY AND 

  OF THIS REFORM. 

  i ECONOMIC MODELLING I COMMISSIONED LAST YEAR, PERFORMED 

  BY ECONTECH, SHOWS THAT BY 2007-2008 ALL AUSTRALIANS 

  WILL BE SOME $134 PER PERSON PER YEAR BETTER OFF AS A 

  RESULT OF THIS GOVERNMENT’S INCREASED FOCUS ON SKILLED 

  MIGRATION. 

  ; THE GOVERNMENT’S APPROACH IS FURTHER VINDICATED IN AN 

  ACIL CONSULTING REPORT WHICH SHOWS THE STRENGTHENING 

  Page 5 of 20 

  IMPACT ON THE NATION’S BUDGET OF THE REFORMED MIGRATION 

  PROGRAM. 

  RESEARCH RECENTLY CONDUCTED BY ACCESS ECONOMICS INTO THE 

  PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESS MIGRANTS COMPARED THEIR BUSINESSES 

  WITH OTHER AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES OF COMPARABLE AGE, SIZE AND 

  INDUSTRY SECTOR. 

  > THE BUSINESS MIGRANTS’ ENTERPRISES WERE FOUND TO BE 

  GENERALLY MORE PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF NET WORTH, TURNOVER 

  AND EXPORT LEVELS. 

  A RECENT REPORT BY MY BUSINESS ADVISORY PANEL, CHAIRED BY 

  NEVILLE ROACH, HAS PROPOSED SOME CHANGES TO FURTHER INCREASE 

  THE DRAWING POWER OF THE BUSINESS MIGRATION CATEGORY WITHOUT 

  COMPROMISING ITS OBJECTIVES. . 

  > THESE CHANGES MAY SEE AN INCREASE OVER TIME OF 15% IN THE 

  NUMBER OF BUSINESS OWNERS WHO COME TO AUSTRALIA. 

  THE OVERWHELMING SUCCESS OF SUCH RESTRUCTURING HAS MANY 

  PEOPLE DEMANDING PHENOMENAL INCREASES IN OUR PERMANENT 

  SKILLED MIGRANT INTAKE. 

  WHILE I APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM, IT SIMPLY MUST BE 

  UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE IS NOT A BOTTOMLESS PIT OF SKILLED 

  MIGRANTS WAITING FOR THE CALL TO MIGRATE TO AUSTRALIA. 

  ANY ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE A SUDDEN OR SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN 

  THE NUMBERS OF SKILLED MIGRANTS WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY 

  REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT DILUTION OF SELECTION STANDARDS. 

  Page 6 of 20 

  ‘r ADDITIONAL MIGRANTS WOULD BE OLDER, LESS SKILLED OR LESS 

  FLUENT IN ENGLISH - AND LESS EMPLOYABLE. 

  2 IN FACT THE ACIL REPORT I MENTIONED EARLIER SHOWS THAT 

  UNSKILLED MIGRANTS ARE GENERALLY A MAJOR COST TO THE 

  COMMONWEALTH BUDGET. 

  TO PUT NOT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING 

  OUR INTAKE IN AN UNTARGETED MANNER WOULD SIGNAL A RETURN 

  TO THE BAD OLD DAYS OF BRINGING IN LARGE NUMBERS OF POORLY 

  QUALIFIED MIGRANTS MERELY TO SWELL THE RANKS OF THE 

  UNEMPLOYED. 

  ANY ATTEMPT TO FURTHER INCREASE THE SKILLED INTAKE MUST 

  PROCEED IN A TARGETED AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED MANNER 

  THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A MAJOR DILUTION IN SELECTION 

  STANDARDS. 

  WE MUST ALSO ACHIEVE A BETTER DISPERSAL OF THE INTAKE TO 

  THOSE STATES THAT MOST NEED MORE SKILLED MIGRANTS. WE 

  ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING A PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS AND THE 

  STATES ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. 

  IN JULY OF THIS YEAR A NEW POINTS TEST USED TO SELECT THE 

  MAJORITY OF SKILLED MIGRANTS WAS INTRODUCED FOLLOWING A 

  COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. 

  THIS WILL ENABLE SELECTION OF MIGRANTS WHO WILL BETTER MEET THE 

  NEEDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOUR MARKET. 

  IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A BETTER DISPERSAL OF THE SKILLED INTAKE, I 

  INTRODUCED A RANGE OF PROGRAMS THAT STATE GOVERNMENTS CAN 

  Page 7 of 20 

  - 

  USE. 

  > SADLY, THESE MECHANISMS ARE UNDERUTILISED AT PRESENT - 

  EVEN BY THOSE STATES PROFESSING A DESIRE FOR HIGHER 

  IMMIGRATION LEVELS. 

  SINCE 1 JULY 1999 NEW MEASURES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO 

  STREAMLINE THE EMPLOYER NOMINATION PROVISIONS TO 

  EMPLOYERS TO MEET CRITICAL SKILL NEEDS WHILE ENSURI 

  EMPLOYERS ARE STILL COMMITTED TO TRAINING. 

  ENABLE 

  NG THAT 

  + AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONCLUDE A 

  NUMBER OF LABOUR AGREEMENTS WITH LARGE AUSTRALIAN 

  EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE OVER 1,000 TEMPORARY VISAS AND 

  500 PERMANENT VISAS IN THE IT&T SECTOR OVER A THREE-YEAR 

  PERIOD. 1 

  SADLY, HOWEVER, THESE EXAMPLES ARE MORE THE EXCEPTION 

  THAN THE RULE. LABOUR AGREEMENTS CONTINUE TO BE 

  UNDERUTILISED GIVEN THE REPORTS OF SKILL SHORTAGES. 

  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO EFFECTED A CRITICAL SHIFT IN THE WAY IN 

  WHICH GREATER NUMBERS OF SUCCESSFUL OVERSEAS STUDENTS ARE 

  ABLE TO MIGRATE TO AUSTRALIA AFTER COMPLET 

  r THIS GIVES AUSTRALIA A SIGNIFICANT COMPET 

  TERMS OF BOTH ATTRACTING MORE OVERSEAS 

  SKILLED MIGRANTS. 

  NG THEIR STUDIES. 

  TIVE ADVANTAGE IN 

  STUDENTS AND MORE 

  HOWEVER, THE 5,000 PLACE CONTINGENCY RESERVE I ESTABLISHED 

  IN THIS YEAR’S MIGRATION PROGRAM OFFERS PERHAPS THE 

  GREATEST EXAMPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT’S PREPAREDNESS TO 

  Page 8 of 20 

  INCREASE THE SKILLED INTAKE WITHOUT DILUTING SELECTION 

  CRITERIA. 

  3 THIS MECHANISM CREATES THE SCOPE TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF 

  THE MIGRATION PROGRAM AS LONG AS BUSINESS, INDUSTRY 

  AND STATE/TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS TARGET ADDITIONAL 

  MIGRANTS WHERE A DEMONSTRABLE SHORTAGE EXISTS IN A 

  SPECIFIC SKILL. 

  TO DATE HOWEVER THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE 

  PORTION OF THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE WILL 

  2000. THIS IS DESPITE THE EFFORTS MADE BY 

  l-HAT A SIGNIFICANT 

  BE USED IN 1999- 

  MY DEPARTMENT 

  AND I TO ENCOURAGE STATES AND BUSINESSES TO TAKE UP THE 

  MECHANISMS DESIGNED FOR THEIR USE. 

  CLEARLY THE KEY TO THESE INITIATIVES IS PARTNERSHIPS. 

  FOR THEM TO SUCCEED, BUSINESSES THAT PROFESS A DESIRE FOR 

  MORE SKILLED MIGRANTS NEED TO ACTIVELY SEEK THEM OUT AND 

  FIND A PLACE FOR THEM WITHIN THEIR INDUSTRY AND WITHIN THEIR 

  ORGANISATIONS. 

  GOVERNMENTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP ROLE BY 

  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS TO ASSIST BUSINESS GET 

  THE SKILLED MIGRANTS THEY NEED. 

  ;- BUT IT IS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SIMPLY 

  FLOOD THE MARKETPLACE WITH NEW ARRIVALS WITH NO 

  OCCUPATIONAL OR OTHER TARGETING. 

  Page 9 of 20 

  > THE CHALLENGE LIES BEFORE YOU, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, 

  TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENT TO USE THE MECHANISMS THAT 

  HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. 

  TEMPORARY ENTRY PROVISIONS 

  THE PROSPECT OF MARKEDLY DILUTED SELECTION STANDARDS IS 

  NOT THE ONLY CONSTRAINING FACTOR ON THE NUMBERS OF 

  SKILLED MIGRANTS AUSTRALIA IS ABLE TO ATTRACT. 

  THE FACT IS THAT WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL POOL OF SKILLED 

  MIGRANTS IS LIMITED, THE COMPETITION TO ATTRACT THEM IS 

  INTENSIFYING. NATIONS NOT TRADITIONALLY SEEN AS MIGRATION 

  SOURCE COUNTRIES WILL INCREASINGLY JOIN THE RACE WITH 

  USUAL DESTINATIONS SUCH AS OURSELVES, THE UNITED STATES, 

  CANADA AND NEW ZEALAND. I 

  AS SUCH WE HAVE TO BE MORE INNOVATIVE AND APPLY NEW 

  TECHNIQUES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE RACE FOR THIS HIGHLY 

  ATTRACTIVE LABOUR. 

  THE SCALE OF THIS CHALLENGE MEANS THAT WE CAN’T CONTINUE 

  TO BE BLINKERED BY POLICY THAT ENCOMPASSES ONLY PERMANENT 

  RESETTLEMENT. 

  > IF WE WERE TO CONTINUE IN THIS FASHION WE WOULD BE DOING 

  THIS NATION A GREAT DISSERVICE. 

  IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT WE ARE SO FIRMLY EMBRACING THE 

  ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BY LONG-TERM TEMPORARY 

  MIGRATION. 

  Page IO of 20 

  INCREASED INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT, AND THE 

  GENERATION OF NEW AND GROWING MARKETS FOR YOUNG SKILLED 

  WORKERS IN SECTORS SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HAS 

  LED TO INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE MOV 

  AROUND THE WORLD. 

  NOT WANTING THEIR OPPORTUNITIES OR ABILI’ 

  NG TEMPORAR 

  IES TO BE CON =INED, 

  MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE SEEKING LONG-TERM ENTRY TO 

  COUNTRIES SUCH AS AUSTRALIA. 

  ALLOW ME TO PUT THIS PHENOMENON INTO PERSPECTIVE. 

  i SOME 33,000 LONG-TERM TEMPORARY RESIDENT BUSINESS 

  VISAS WERE GRANTED IN AUSTRALIA IN 1998-99 - ALMOST THE 

  SAME AMOUNT AS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SKILLED PERMANENT 

  MIGRATION VISAS ISSUED FOR THE SAME’PERIOD. 

  THE NUMBER OF THESE SKILLED TEMPORARY ENTRANTS HAS BEEN 

  RISING STEADILY OVER RECENT YEARS. 

  LONG-TERM TEMPORARY MOVEMENTS NOW MAKE-UP AROUND 50% 

  OF NET OVERSEAS MIGRATION, THE KEY MEASURE OF THE 

  CONTRIBUTION OF IMMIGRATION TO POPULATION GROWTH. 

  THE 33,000 HIGHLY SKILLED TEMPORARY ENTRANTS THAT CAME TO 

  AUSTRALIA IN 1998-1999, SPONSORED BY COMPANIES IN 

  AUSTRALIA, REPRESENT ABOUT SIX TIMES THE NUMBER SPONSORED 

  BY BUSINESS FOR PERMANENT ENTRY (5,600). 

  THESE INDIVIDUALS MAKE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA’S 

  INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. 

  Page II of 20 

  > THEY BRING WITH THEM NEW IDEAS, SKILLS, TECHNOLOGY, 

  UNDERSTANDING AND CONTACTS. 

  TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES THIS GOVERNMENT 

  HAS DEVELOPED STREAMLINED LONG-TERM TEMPORARY ENTRY 

  ARRANGEMENTS. 

  > THESE ARE RATED AMONGST THE MOST EFFECTIVE 

  ARRANGEMENTS IN THE WORLD FOR ATTRACTING WHAT IS A 

  HIGHLY MOBILE AND LUCRATIVE WORKFORCE. 

  LONG-TERM TEMPORARY MIGRATION WILL BECOME THE 

  TOUCHSTONE FOR MIGRATION’S INTERNATIONAL FUTURE. AS 

  AUSTRALIA DOES NOT IMPOSE NUMERIC CONTROLS ON THESE 

  TEMPORARY ENTRY CATEGORIES THEIR VOLUME IS LIKELY TO 

  CONTINUE TO RISE. 1 

  ALLOW ME TO PUT A CRUDE SCENARIO TO YOU TO DEMONSTRATE 

  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TEMPORARY BUSINESS ENTRY 

  ARRANGEMENTS. 

  ; IF BILL GATES WERE TO ARRIVE IN AUSTRALIA TOMORROW TO 

  ESTABLISH A NEW ENTERPRISE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AS 

  MANY I.T. STAFF AS HE WANTED ON LONG-TERM TEMPORARY 

  VISAS. HE WOULD ONLY NEED TO PAY THEM THE APPROPRIATE 

  SALARY AND HAVE APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE TO 

  TRAIN AUSTRALIANS. 

  IN THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER, HE IS CONFRONTED BY WHAT IS 

  KNOWN AS THE ‘H-l B VISA CAP’ WHICH LIMITS THE NUMBER OF I.T. 

  PEOPLE HE CAN OBTAIN FROM OVERSEAS. 

  Page 12 of 20 

  WHILE MANY OF YOU PRESENT TODAY MAY PUBLICLY CHAMPION 

  INCREASING PERMANENT RESETTLEMENT NUMBERS, AND PAY LITTLE 

  OR NO ATTENTION TO LONG-TERM TEMPORARY MIGRANTS, MAY I 

  SUGGEST YOU TAKE A ‘STRAW POLL’ OF YOUR HUMAN RESOURCE 

  MANAGERS TO GAIN THEIR PERSPECTIVE. 

  I COULD ALMOST GUARANTEE YOU THAT YOUR H-R CHIEFS WOULD 

  TELL YOU THAT THEY MUCH PREFER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR 

  LONG-TERM TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENTS THAN TO USE PERMANENT 

  ENTRY. 

  THE REASON FOR THIS IS SIMPLE. 

  g LONG-TERM TEMPORARY ENTRY ARRANGEMENTS ENABLE 

  COMPANIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY RETAIN THE SKILLED 

  MIGRANTS THEY ATTRACT. , 

  ;- ALMOST PARADOXICALLY, PERMANENT ENTRY ARRANGEMENTS 

  MEAN THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE FREE TO GO TO ANOTHER 

  EMPLOYER IN AUSTRALIA. 

  POPULATION POLICY 

  ALLOW ME TO NOW MOVE TO AN AREA THAT I KNOW IS 

  PARTICULARLY DEAR TO YOUR HEART - POPULATION POLICY. 

  A RANGE OF DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS, THE BUSINESS COUNCIL 

  INCLUDED, HAVE PROPOSED THE ADOPTION OF A FORMAL 

  POPULATION POLICY. 

  AS MINISTER I AM THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF A 

  CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ISSUE. 

  Page 13 of 20 

  I HAVE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED MORE OPEN DISCUSSION OF 

  IMMIGRATION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF POPULATION. 

  > IN FACT I HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF SPEECHES ON AUSTRALIA’S 

  POPULATION TRENDS AND PROSPECTS IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE 

  THIS IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING. 

  i I ALSO MADE POPULATION ISSUES A MAJOR FOCUS OF MY 

  PRESENTATIONS AT PUBLIC MEETINGS TO CONSULT ON THE 199% 

  2000 IMMIGRATION PROGRAM, AND SPONSORED A MAJOR 

  CONFERENCE ON THE TOPIC EARLIER THIS YEAR. 

  IN THESE SPEECHES AND SEMINARS I HAVE INDICATED THAT THE 

  BROAD DIRECTION OF OUR POPULATION IS CLEAR. 

  BASED ON OUR BELOW REPLACEMENT FERTILITY RATE, COUPLED 

  WITH NET OVERSEAS MIGRATION AROUND 60-70,000 PEOPLE PER 

  ANNUM, OUR POPULATION IS LIKELY TO REACH AROUND 23 MILLION 

  - PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE - BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT CENTURY. AT 

  THIS POINT IT WOULD STABILISE IN BOTH ITS SIZE AND AGE PROFILE. 

  > I HAVE MADE THE POINT BEFORE AND I MAKE IT AGAIN -THIS IS 

  NOT A FIGURE THAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE ALARMING TO MOST 

  AUSTRALIANS. 

  I AM AWARE THAT SOME HAVE SUGGESTED WE SHOULD BE AIMING 

  FOR A LOWER LEVEL OF POPULATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL GROUNDS. 

  r WHILE WE MUST TAKE ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS INTO 

  ACCOUNT, I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THE SOCIAL AND 

  ECONOMIC COSTS INVOLVED WOULD OUTWEIGH ANY 

  Page 14 of 20 

  ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM A MARGINALLY LOWER 

  POPULATION. 

  > I HAVE, NEVERTHELESS, COMMISSIONED THE CSIRO TO EXAMINE 

  THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT. 

  I AM ALSO AWARE THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR 

  HAS ADVOCATED THAT WE SHOULD BE AIMING FOR A MUCH HIGHER 

  LEVEL OF POPULATION THROUGH BOTH IMMIGRATION AND BY 

  ENCOURAGING HIGHER LEVELS OF FERTILITY. 

  THE GOVERNMENT OF COURSE HAS A STRONG COMMITMENT TO 

  FAMILY FRIENDLY POLICIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THESE. 

  I LOOK FORWARD TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY JOINING WITH THE 

  GOVERNMENT TO ENABLE ALL AUSTRALIANS TO BETTER BALANCE 

  WORK AND FAMILY LIFE. 

  I MUST CAUTION, HOWEVER, ON ANY SPECULATION THAT FAMILY 

  FRIENDLY POLICIES WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON FERTILITY 

  RATES. 

  ; THE RESEARCH SEEMS TO SUGGEST A MARGINAL AND SHORT- 

  TERM IMPACT IS THE BEST WE CAN EXPECT. 

  I WOULD ALSO CAUTION AGAINST THE VIEW THAT A SIGNIFICANTLY 

  LARGER POPULATION WILL DELIVER US SOME KIND OF ‘ECONOMIC 

  NIRVANA’. 

  i PROFESSOR BOB GREGORY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS 

  NO CLEAR LINKAGE BETWEEN POPULATION GROWTH AND PER 

  CAPITA ECONOMIC GROWTH. 

  Page 15 of 20 

  > IF THERE WERE SUCH A DIRECT LINK, COUNTRI 

  BANGLADESH WOULD BE BOOMING 

  ES SUCH AS 

  > INCREASING IMMIGRATION SIMPLY FOR THE PL IRPOSES OF 

  ACHIEVING A LARGE POPULATION IS A FAR TOO SIMPLISTIC 

  APPROACH. 

  > WE NEED TO BE FAR MORE CLEVER ABOUT THIS ISSUE. 

  AS CHRIS MURPHY OF ECONTECH HAS SHOWN, THE KEY IS QUALITY 

  FAR MORE THAN QUANTITY. 

  THE SHORT SIGHTEDNESS OF A DRIVE TO SIMPLY INCREASE THE 

  IGHL IGHTED BY THE GROSS PERMANENT MIGRATION INTAKE IS H 

  SITUATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 

  CONSIDER THIS. 

  k+ NEW ZEALAND HAS BY FAR THE LARGEST PER CAPITA 

  PERMANENT MIGRATION PROGRAM IN THE WORLD AND HAS HAD 

  FOR MANY YEARS. 

  ; YET IT HAS FAILED TO DELIVER STRONG ECONOMIC 

  PERFORMANCE FOR NEW ZEALAND. 

  ;- IT HAS ALSO FAILED TO DELIVER A NET INCREASE IN POPULATION 

  FROM MIGRATION. THE RELATIVELY POOR PERFORMANCE OF THE 

  NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY HAS RESULTED IN THEIR RATE OF NET 

  OVERSEAS MIGRATION FALLING TO NEGATIVE 10,000. 

  Page 16 of 20 

  > PUT ANOTHER WAY, DESPITE THEIR HUGE PER CAPITA INTAKE, 

  FAR MORE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THAN ARRIVING. 

  CLEARLY, A LARGE PERMANENT INTAKE DOES NOT GUARANTEE AN 

  IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY, A HIGH RATE OF POPULATION 

  GROWTH, OR EVEN POSITIVE LEVELS OF NET OVERSEAS MIGRATION. 

  USA COMPARISON 

  WHILE I AM ON THE TOPIC OF OTHER COUNTRIES IMMIGRATION 

  PROGRAMS, ALLOW ME TO QUICKLY UNDERTAKE A PERFORMANCE 

  ASSESSMENT OF OUR PROGRAM BY COMPARING IT TO THAT 

  OPERATED BY THE UNITED STATES. 

  r COMMENTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN MADE IN WHICH OUR 

  PROGRAM WAS UNFAIRLY AND UNFAVOURABLY COMPARED 

  INTERNATIONALLY - I THINK THE FOLLOWING COMPARISON WILL 

  AMEND THE PUBLIC RECORD. 

  THE U.S. IS REGARDED BY MANY, QUITE RIGHTLY, AS THE WORLD’S 

  GREATEST IMMIGRANT NATION. 

  BUT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTS: 

  g AUSTRALIA AND THE U.S. HAVE A FAIRLY SIMILAR POPULATION 

  GROWTH RATE AND WE BOTH FACE THE PROSPECT OF THIS 

  GROWTH RATE DECLINING OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. 

  v THE PERCENTAGE OF OVERSEAS BORN IN AUSTRALIA’S 

  POPULATION IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OF THE U.S. AND THIS 

  WILL REMAIN THE CASE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

  Page 17 of 20 

  2 AUSTRALIA’S OFFICIAL PERMANENT MIGRATION INTAKE IS, IN PER 

  CAPITA TERMS, ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

  > WHAT’S MORE OUR OFF-SHORE REFUGEE PROGRAM IS LARGER 

  THAN THAT OFFERED BY THE US - IN FACT IT IS, IN PER CAPITA 

  TERMS, THE MOST GENEROUS IN THE WORLD. 

  THE U.S. IMMIGRATION PROGRAM IS HEAVILY SKEWED TO FAMILY 

  MIGRATION - A PROBLEM THIS GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED TO GRAPPLE 

  WITH IMMEDIATELY AFTER COMING TO OFFICE BUT ONE THAT CONTINUES 

  TO PLAGUE THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. 

  > THE NEED TO REDRESS THIS IMBALANCE IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION 

  OF THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN THE U.S. AND 

  WAS THE KEY RECOMMENDATION OF THE JORDAN COMMISSION 

  ESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON. ’ 

  AS FAMILY REUNION DOMINATES THE U.S. PROGRAM IT FOLLOWS THAT 

  THEIR SKILLED MIGRATION INTAKE IS SMALL. 

  > IN FACT IN PER CAPITA TERMS THEIR SKILLED INTAKE IS MINISCULE 

  COMPARED TO AUSTRALIA’S. 

  FURTHERMORE, UNLIKE IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 

  DAY IS FREE TO INCREASE THE SKILLED INTAKE AS IT SEES FIT, IN THE U.S. 

  IT IS REGULATED BY CONGRESS AND CAN NOT BE ALTERED WITHOUT NEW 

  LEGISLATION. 

  ;- AND WHILE WE RECOGNISE AND ENCOURAGE THE ECONOMIC ENGINE 

  ROOM OF SKILLED TEMPORARY ENTRY BY ALLOWING IT’S SIZE TO BE 

  DEMAND DRIVEN, THE US SKILLED TEMPORARY ENTRY INTAKE IS 

  Page 18 of 20 

  CAPPED AT AN INSIGNIFICANT LEVEL COMPARED TO AUSTRALIA’S, 

  RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF OUR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIES. 

  WE ALSO HAVE AN OVERSEAS STUDENT INTAKE THAT IN PER CAPITA 

  TERMS IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE U.S. 

  3 IT IS ALSO MORE VARIED AND IS HIGHLIGHTED BY MORE OPPORTUNITIES 

  FOR SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS TO MIGRATE HERE PERMANENTLY. 

  BUT TO END THIS COMPARISON ON A POINT OF COMMONALITY, THE U.S. 

  HAS REJECTED THE NEED FOR A FORMAL POPULATION POLICY. 

  THEIR POSITION ON THIS ISSUE CAME IN RESPONSE TO THE 

  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN 

  1994. THAT POSITION IS UNCHANGED.   . 

  WHILE POPULATION POLICY MAY BE A TOPICAL CATCH-CRY FOR THOSE 

  SEEKING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE IN IMMIGRATION 

  NUMBNERS, THE FACT IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHOSE EXAMPLE 

  WE MAY WISH TO FOLLOW HAS A FORMAL POPULATION POLICY. 

  CONCLUSION 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALLOW ME TO CONCLUDE BY POINTING 

  OUT THAT IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION POLICY THE UNDERLYING 

  AIMS AND ASPIRATIONS OF BUSINESS AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE 

  NOT VERY DIFFERENT. 

  WE BOTH WANT AN ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY VIBRANT 

  AUSTRALIA THAT IS SUSTAINABLE INTO THE FUTURE. 

  Page 19 of 20 

  THIS GOVERNMENT HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY OVER THE LAST FOUR 

  YEARS TO REBUILD PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN AN IMMIGRATION 

  PROGRAM THAT HAS PALPABLE BENEFITS FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS. 

  OUR NATION CANNOT AFFORD TO RETURN TO A PROGRAM 

  CHARACTERISED BY BIG NUMBERS AND LITTLE THOUGHT. 

  IF YOU GENUINELY WANT TO SEE IMMIGRATION PLAY A VITAL ROLE 

  IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO 

  RETURN TO THE DAYS WHEN SKILLED MIGRATION, ECONOMIC 

  DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC SUPPORT WERE TREATED DISDAINFULLY. 

  WE LIVE IN A FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED AND DISCERNING WORLD - 

  WE NEED TO MATCH THESE NEW REALITIES WITH NEW THINKING 

  AND NEW PARTNERSHIPS. 

  I TRUST THAT TODAY WILL MARK ONE STEP IN THE BUILDING OF 

  SUCH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT.
