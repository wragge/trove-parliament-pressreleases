 Address to UNHCR Executive Committee Meeting

 Speech by Philip Ruddock to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Executive Committee Meeting, 30 September - 4 October 2002, Geneva, Switzerland.

 (Check against delivery)

 Mr Chairman, I convey our appreciation for the important contribution made by your predecessor and his Bureau over the last year, and congratulate you personally on your election.

 Mr Chairman, when we survey the massive challenges in relation to so many millions of people around the world still of concern to UNHCR, it is tempting to come to the conclusion that we can hope to succeed only at the edges of the problem.

 I would like to offer a more optimistic perspective. Looking back over the last decade, I note that, in 1995, there were some 27 million refugees and people of concern to UNHCR. This compares with 19.7million at the end of 2001, and with the movements currently occurring in the world, we might reasonably expect that number to continue to fall.

 There has been progress. Some major refugee situations have been resolved over the years. Most recently we have had very promising results in progressing resolution of the refugee caseloads in the Balkans, East Timor, parts of Africa and also Afghanistan.

 The timeliness and extent of success can clearly be linked with active and purposeful management and coordination by UNHCR and other international organisations and the cooperation of States. Australia, as one of the earliest signatories to the Convention, and a country that has continuously maintained an active program of international refugee resettlement since the Second World War, wants to see the international system of protection work.

 In recent times this has led us to make some hard choices. We have had a measure of success in dealing with flows of unauthorised arrivals brought to our shores by people smugglers -- some of them are refugees leaving protection in other places to seek a migration outcome and others are not in need of protection.

 We have expended considerable effort and resources in ensuring that protection is provided to those who need it, the work of people smugglers is disrupted and those not in need of protection returned to their home country. We have been prepared to do this in the face of considerable criticism.

 Why?

 First, because this approach 'saves lives'. It removes the incentive for people to leave places of protection and risk their lives in dangerous journeys with people smugglers.

 Secondly, it 'saves space' for those refugees we cannot see and whose voices are not heard - refugees who have no capacity to move, who cannot afford a people smuggler, and whose only prospect of a durable solution is resettlement.

 I do not suggest it is easy to make this choice. I understand the compassion that draws focus and attention to asylum seekers we see and hear -those who arrive on our shores or through our land borders. Australians are compassionate people, but we are prepared to make hard choices. We may feel sorry for all people in less fortunate circumstances but Australia alone cannot help all of those who need help. We must choose. And we must retain community support for a resettlement program that assists those most in need.

 I was recently in Tanzania, where I visited UNHCR's Lukole refugee camp(s) and was shown the clear potential for the successful repatriation of many.

 But I also came away with a very clear picture of the sub-group of refugees within that caseload who will never be able to return or to integrate where they are and for whom resettlement is the only option. I have come face to face, in other camps and places, with sizeable numbers of refugees in similar circumstances.

 It is refugees like these that we, the international community, are currently failing. We cannot simply focus our energy, our resources, our compassion on people who are reaching the borders of Western countries through secondary or tertiary movements; we must remember the needs of those who are further away. They may be out of sight, they should not be out of mind.

 Mr Chairman, we must not be complacent. We must not allow ourselves to be diverted by sterile arguments about the nuances of refugee law in states with sophisticated systems of refugee status determination.

 We cannot let the situation continue where, just to find the relatively few refugees among those who seek asylum in western countries, we are spending over 10 times UNHCR's budget and possibly more.

 Australia chooses to adopt policy positions that allow us both to meet our protection obligations towards refugee arrivals and continue to resettle some of those who do not have a choice. Mr Chairman, we welcome the increased focus of the international community on these hard choices - the hard choices we have to make if we are to find solutions for the millions of people still waiting, reliant on the continuing generosity of host countries for asylum.

 Collectively, we must:

 provide greater assistance for countries of first asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» more creatively utilise aid and development linkages to support protection and create durable solutions; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» build coalitions of source, destination and transit countries to provide holistic solutions to particular flows of people; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» preserve and expand resettlement; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 deal more effectively with the secondary movements of refugees and the impacts of the asylum/migration nexus. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Piecemeal and sporadic efforts are inefficient and unacceptable. While refugee caseloads languish waiting for the sustained attention of the international community, the international protection system remains threatened. People smugglers prey on refugees and prosper, and States' resources are wasted. But most importantly, refugees' lives are on hold.

 Mr Chairman, I have been a vocal advocate of the need for more determined work by UNHCR to assist governments in addressing these issues. I therefore welcome the fresh look that UNHCR is taking at some of these issues and the High Commissioner's thoughts on "Convention Plus". We are also very encouraged by the progress in addressing such issues in our own region through the Bali Ministerial process initiated by Indonesia and Australia.

 This gives me some hope that we can produce effective answers.

 In this regard, the Agenda for Protection contains a number of suggested areas of work in relation to the issues I have identified. These areas should be amongst our priorities as we take the Agenda forward. Australia stands ready to work with UNHCR and others, in further efforts of this sort.

 Two final points Mr Chairman. As a further contribution to the Global Consultations process, I am pleased to announce the launch today of a publication titled Interpreting the Refugees Convention - an Australian perspective .

 This publication brings together the Australian Government's contributions to the Roundtable discussions that focussed on the interpretation of the Convention. It reflects a rigorous analysis of current international law and Australia's considered position on interpretation of some of the important provisions of the Convention. I commend this document to you which is now available on the Department web site.

 I would also like to commend to you the (recently launched) UNHCR Handbook to Guide Reception and Integration of Resettled Refugees. This Handbook, the product of contributions by many States, including funding provided by the Australian government, draws on the knowledge of those countries with a tradition of providing extensive services to resettled refugees and provides a roadmap for how best to help refugees rebuild their lives.

 And that, basically, should be the goal that unites us: the creation of sustainable, lasting solutions for all refugees, starting with those in greatest need.

 Australia remains committed to doing that, and to facing up to the real challenges and dilemma that faces governments. We look to the UNHCR to work with us in these endeavors.
