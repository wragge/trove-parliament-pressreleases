 Most Arrivals in a Decade to the Northern Territory

 VPS 007/2005

 The Northern Territory attracted the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 Nearly 600 people arrived and settled in the Northern Territory in 2003-04, an increase of more than 100 from the previous year’s total of 483.

 ‘The increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1993-94 just 370 settlers arrived in the Northern Territory,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘This means that in the past 10 years Northern Territory arrivals have increased by over 60 per cent, in line with the national increase, with well  over 200 countries represented nationally.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.’ 

 Australia-wide, the largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South  Africa, the Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
