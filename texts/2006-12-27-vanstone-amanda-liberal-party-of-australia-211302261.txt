 Big increase in migrants settling in SA 

 South Australia has laid out the welcome mat for migrants, with the number of new settlers  almost doubling in the past two years. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said 9099 migrants  settled in Adelaide and South Australia’s regional areas in 2005-2006. 

 ‘That’s an increase of 2735 or 43 per cent on the previous year alone and a sure sign that  South Australia’s reputation as a great place to live and work is growing,’ Senator Vanstone  said. 

 ‘The South Australian community is to be congratulated for welcoming these people into their  lives so readily and willingly.’ 

 More than 3000 United Kingdom settlers made South Australia their new home in 2005-2006,  while the Sudan contributed to the tally with 248, China with 879, India with 909 and  Afghanistan with 373. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’     

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
