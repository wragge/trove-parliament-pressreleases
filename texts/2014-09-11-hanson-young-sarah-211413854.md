 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Thursday, 11 September 2014    

 Morrison holding children to ransom in push  for TPVs    

 The Australian Greens have accused the Immigration Minister of holding children to ransom and  attempting to bully the Senate into passing laws that will leave refugees living in limbo because  of the government’s obsession with cruelty.    

 “Offshore processing has collapsed and the Greens won’t be bullied into backing the  government’s cruel and punitive Temporary Protection Visas,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “TPVs are just another measure in the Abbott government’s toolbox of cruelty.    

 “It’s entirely inappropriate of the Immigration Minister to hold children in detention to ransom  so that he can get TPVs through the Senate. The Parliament has rejected TPVs and, today, the  High Court has ruled that the Immigration Minister’s use of two other types of temporary visas  is unlawful.    

 “Mr Morrison wants to be above the courts and above the Parliament. He wants to bully the  Senate into submission, but the Greens won’t vote for cruelty.”
