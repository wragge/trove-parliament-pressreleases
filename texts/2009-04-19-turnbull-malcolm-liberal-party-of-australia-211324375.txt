 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WENTWORTH 

 

 19 April 2009   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  SYDNEY 

 

 Subjects:  Labor’s failed policies on people smuggling.    

 E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………………………………...   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 The time has come for Mr Rudd to tell the Australian people the truth - what did happen on that boat. All of  the Naval personnel are back. They’ve all been interviewed. The Government knows the facts; they’re  getting hourly reports. We need to know precisely what happened. And we’ve also seen reports that the  Australian Federal Police has advised the Government that their change in policy in August last year has  resulted in the dramatic increase in unauthorised boat arrivals, in illegal immigration. The Government  refuses to make that report public. The Immigration Minister this morning said he hadn’t received any such  report. Now that’s not believable.     The Government’s position is unbelievable on many fronts. They say that the fact that unauthorised boat 

 arrivals had dwindled to a trickle under the policies of the previous government was a coincidence. They say  the fact that they have risen dramatically since the Rudd Government softened our border protection rules is  also a coincidence. That doesn’t add up. It’s not believable. The Federal Police provides a report with the  benefit of all of their intelligence in Indonesia and their liaison with the Indonesian authorities, and the  Immigration Minister says he hasn’t seen it. That’s not believable either. It’s time for Mr Rudd to step up  and give us the facts.   

 QUESTION:   

 How do you think the Government should handle this debacle?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 The Government has got to send a strong message that these illegal boat arrivals are not welcome, but it has  to have effective policies. We had policies in government which were effective. The Rudd Government  abandoned them and, as a consequence, we have seen a dramatic increase in unauthorised boat arrivals. 

 

 QUESTION:   

 Why do you think the Government hasn’t provided clearer details of the circumstances surrounding the  explosion?

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 As every hour goes on without the facts being made clear, we get more and more suspicious that there is  some sort of cover up going on. The Naval personnel that witnessed the events on the boat have all come  back to Australia. They have all been interviewed by the Police. It is unbelievable that the Government  doesn’t know precisely what has happened, so all we can say is that Julia Gillard and Chris Evans’  stonewalling is because they don’t want to tell the people the truth. We are entitled to know the facts. We  need to know what happened on that boat and we need to know what the Australian Federal Police has  advised the Government, because if the AFP has, as it has been reported, told the Government that their  policies will result in an increase in unauthorised boat arrivals - and that is precisely what has happened -  then plainly the Government’s policies are not working. The Government’s policies have failed and the  Government has to change its policies. Now we’re happy to sit down with the Government and work with  them to see if we can agree on a common response, because we should all be committed to keeping our  borders secure and ensuring that this vile trade of people smuggling comes to an end. 

 

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible]   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well the Pacific Solution has been superseded by the detention facilities on Christmas Island, so that is a  non-issue. The temporary protection visas were an important way of discriminating between those people  who arrived on aeroplanes, for example, and those people who arrived unlawfully on boats. Now the aim of  that was deliberately to act as a deterrent to people smugglers, because people smuggling is bad on some  many fronts. It offends against the integrity of our own borders and it also puts the lives of both the  passengers and the Australian Defence Force’s personnel who have to deal with them at very grave risk, as  we have seen. So people smuggling must be stopped and we have to use every measure we can to do that.    

 Now we had a policy in place. That was working. The evidence was that there were no boat arrivals or  hardly any. We had 25 in all of last year and in past years, recent years, we’ve had none. We’ve had over  450 since August and there’s another large contingent on its way, so it’s been reported. So we have a serious  problem here, a failure in Mr Rudd’s policies. Now I don’t want to make political capital out of this. I’m  happy to sit down and sit with Mr Rudd with the benefit of the best advice from the AFP and our other  intelligence services and see if we can agree on policies that will be more effective, because at the moment  Mr Rudd is not protecting our borders.   

 QUESTION:   

 What are the options that the Opposition will bring to the table?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well we need to see what the latest intelligence is, but certainly the temporary protection visas were a way  of distinguishing between those who arrived by boat so that they had less of a prospect of achieving or a  more uncertain prospect - perhaps is the best way to describe it - of achieving permanent refugee status.  That was their avowed aim and they appeared to have been effective based on the evidence. Now the 

 Government has abandoned that and as a consequence Australia is - there is no question - that our  immigration laws now are more receptive and more accommodating to people who arrive by boat and we  have seen, as a consequence of that, this dramatic increase in unauthorised boat arrivals.    

 So the fact is Mr Rudd’s policy has failed. He is not protecting our borders and we are seeing a dramatic  increase in people smuggling. So it’s not good enough for Mr Rudd to say that people smugglers are the

 scum of the earth - we all agree on that. What we’ve got to do is ensure that we have policies that put them  out of business.   

 QUESTION:   

 Is there any legitimacy to the claim that the increased numbers of boat people are the result of an increase in  push factors and global destabilisation as Mr Rudd claims?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well there are always push factors but there are also pull factors. The more accommodating, the softer  Australia appears to be as a target for people smuggling, the greater incentive people smugglers have to  target Australia. That is just common sense. Now the Australian Federal Police has given expert advice on  this. The Government is trying to cover that advice up. Let’s put it on the table, because what the  Government is saying is that our policies on border protection have no influence on the level of people  smuggling. Now that is so contrary to common sense, it’s impossible to believe. Australians don’t accept  that. We can determine the policies, the border protection policies, that will be effective. Now what we have  at the moment are policies that are not effective and that’s been proved by the number of boat arrivals. So  you can either say it’s all too hard and there’s nothing we can do about it - that seems to be Mr Rudd’s  position - or you can take action.    

 Now we’re happy to work with the Government to see if we can agree on effective policies that will both  protect our borders and ensure that people smuggling comes to an end, because, as I’ve said, it is not simply  a question of protecting the integrity of our borders - although that is the primary duty of every Australian  government - but remember, every time one of these boats sets out, lives are being put at risk and not just  the lives of the passengers but also the lives of the Australian Defence Force personnel who seek to come to  their aid.    

 Okay, thanks very much. Thank you.
