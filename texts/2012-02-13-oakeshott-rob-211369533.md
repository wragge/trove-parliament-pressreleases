 MEDIA RELEASE 

 13 February 2012 

 ‘CIRCUIT-BREAKER’ PRIVATE MEMBER’S BILL INTRODUCED TO THE HOUSE  

 Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012  - see attached 

 A âcircuit-breakerâ private memberâs bill on asylum seeker policy in Australia has been put to  the Parliament by Independent Lyne MP Rob Oakeshott. 

 “The purpose of the Bill is to try to get agreement between the Labor Party and the Liberal  Party on the issue of offshore and onshore assessment of asylum seekers and to end their  impasse,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “The Bill is a combination of the Governmentâs Bill, which was introduced in response to the  High Court ruling, the Coalitionâs amendment seeking humanitarian standards regarding  Malaysia, and aspects of the bi-partisan Bali Process that all Australian governments since  2002 have committed to. 

 “Asylum seeker policy in the 43rd Parliament is the one policy that is letting this Parliament  down more than any other, and it is doing so because the two major political parties are  stuck in the mud on their âour way or the highwayâ political positioning,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “For all the domestic dispute on asylum seeker policy, it should not be forgotten that both  the Labor Party and the Liberal Party are fully committed to the regional cooperation  framework that is the Bali Process and which involves more than 40 countries.  This  framework, in my view, holds the key to bi-partisanship on the divided domestic politics.” 

 The Bali Process Bill was read in the House this morning and a vote is expected within a  fortnight.   

 “I look forward to talking with all parliamentary colleagues over the coming week about the  issues involved, and seek their support,” Mr Oakeshott said.

 Subdivision A—Removal 1 

 26  At the end of section 198 2  Add: 3 

  (11) This section does not apply to an offshore entry person to whom 4  section 198AD applies. 5 

 27  Section 198A 6  Repeal the section, substitute: 7 

 Subdivision B—Offshore assessment 8 

 198AA  Reason for Subdivision 9 

   This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that: 10   (a) people smuggling, and its undesirable consequences 11  including the resulting loss of life at sea, are major regional 12  problems that need to be addressed; and 13 

  (b) Australia’s commitment to engagement through the Bali 14  Process, including the implementation of the Regional 15  Cooperation Framework, informs Australia’s response to 16  people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related 17 

 transnational crime; and 18    (c) offshore entry persons, including offshore entry persons in 19  respect of whom Australia has or may have protection 20  obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by 21 

 the Refugees Protocol, should be able to be taken to any 22  country designated to be an offshore assessment country; and 23   (d) it is a matter for the Minister to decide which countries 24  should be designated as offshore assessment countries; and 25 

  (e) the designation of a country to be an offshore assessment 26  country need be determined only by reference to the fact that 27  the country is a party to the Regional Cooperation 28  Framework. 29 

 198AB  Offshore assessment country 30 

  (1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, designate that a 31  country is an offshore assessment country. 32 

 Offshore assessment  Schedule 1     

 

 

 Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012       No.      , 2012            7 

  (2) The only conditions for the exercise of the power under 1  subsection (1) are that the Minister thinks that it is in the national 2  interest to designate the country to be an offshore assessment 3  country, and that the country is a party to the Bali Process. 4 

  (3) To avoid doubt, except as stipulated in this section the international 5  obligations or domestic law of the country do not invalidate an 6  exercise of the power under subsection (1).    7 

  (4) Within 14 days of designating a country under subsection (1), the 8  Minister must, in writing, make a request to each of: 9   (a) the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 10  Refugees; and 11 

  (b) the International Organization for Migration 12 

   for a formal statement of the views of each of those organisations 13  in relation to any arrangements that are in place, or are to be put in 14  place, in the country for the treatment of persons taken to the 15  country. 16 

  (5) In considering the national interest for the purposes of 17  subsection (2), the Minister: 18   (a) must have regard to whether or not the country has given 19  Australia any assurances to the effect that: 20 

  (i) the country will not expel or return a person taken to the 21  country under section 198AD to another country where 22  his or her life or freedom would be threatened on 23  account of his or her race, religion, nationality, 24 

 membership of a particular social group or political 25  opinion; and 26   (ii) the country will make an assessment, or permit an 27  assessment to be made, of whether or not a person taken 28 

 to the country under that section is covered by the 29  definition of refugee in Article 1A of the Refugees 30  Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; and 31   (b) may have regard to any other matter which, in the opinion of 32 

 the Minister, relates to the national interest. 33 

  (6) The assurances referred to in paragraph (5)(a) need not be legally 34  binding. 35 

  (7) The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the 36  Minister personally. 37

  (8) If the Minister designates a country under subsection (1), the 1  Minister may, in writing, revoke the designation. 2 

  (9) Transfer of offshore entry persons to an offshore assessment 3  country may not proceed in the absence of a written agreement 4  between Australia and the country for the taking of persons to the 5  country. 6 

  (10) In this section, country includes: 7   (a) a colony, overseas territory or protectorate of a foreign 8  country; and 9   (b) an overseas territory for the international relations of which a 10 

 foreign country is responsible. 11 

 198AC  Documents to be laid before Parliament 12 

  (1) This section applies if the Minister designates a country to be an 13  offshore assessment country under subsection 198AB(1). 14 

  (2) The Minister must cause to be laid before each House of the 15  Parliament: 16   (a) a copy of the designation; and 17   (b) a statement of the Minister’s reasons for thinking it is in the 18 

 national interest to designate the country to be an offshore 19  assessment country, referring in particular to any assurances 20  of a kind referred to in paragraph 198AB(5)(a) that have been 21  given by the country; and 22 

  (c) a copy of the written agreement referred to in subsection 23  198AB(9); and 24   (d) a statement about the Minister’s consultations with the Office 25  of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and 26 

 the International Organization for Migration in relation to the 27  designation, including the nature of those consultations; and 28   (e) any formal statement received pursuant to subsection 29  198AB(4); and 30 

  (f) confirmation that the country is a party to the Regional 31  Cooperation Framework. 32 

  (3) The Minister must comply with subsection (2) within 2 sitting days 33  of each House of the Parliament after the day on which the 34  designation is made. However, if either of the written agreement 35  referred to at paragraph (2)(c) or a formal statement pursuant to 36 

 Offshore assessment  Schedule 1     

 

 

 Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012       No.      , 2012            9 

 paragraph (2)(e) is not available within that timeframe, the 1  agreement or statement may be laid before each House of the 2  Parliament subsequently, but not later than within 2 sitting days of 3  each House of the Parliament after the day of:  4 

  (a) signing of the agreement by both countries, in the case of the 5  written agreement referred to at paragraph (2)(c); or 6   (b) receipt of the statement, in the case of a formal statement 7  pursuant to paragraph (2)(e). 8 

  (4) The sole purpose of laying the documents referred to in 9  subsection (2) before the Parliament is to inform the Parliament of 10  the matters referred to in the documents and nothing in the 11  documents affects the validity of the designation. Similarly, the 12 

 fact that some or all of those documents do not exist does not affect 13  the validity of the designation. 14 

  (5) A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of 15  the designation. 16 

  (6) In this section, agreement includes an agreement, arrangement or 17  understanding: 18   (a) whether or not it is legally binding; and 19   (b) whether it is made before, on or after the commencement of 20 

 this section. 21

 Ministerial direction 13 

  (5) If there are 2 or more offshore assessment countries, the Minister 14  must, by legislative instrument, direct an officer to take an offshore 15  entry person, or a class of offshore entry persons, under 16  subsection (2) to the offshore assessment country specified by the 17 

 Minister in the direction. 18 

  (6) If the Minister gives an officer a direction under subsection (5), the 19  officer must comply with the direction. 20

 assessment country specified by the Minister in the direction. 27
