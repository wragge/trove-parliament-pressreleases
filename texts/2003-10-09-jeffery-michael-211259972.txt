 SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC (Retd) GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA AT A ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE OF AUSTRALIA

 TRIENNIAL INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR DINNER  NATIONAL CONVENTION CENTRE, CANBERRA THURSDAY, 9 OCTOBER 2003

 National President of RUSI, Air Marshal David Evans

 Ministers Hill and Downer

 Ambassadors

 Distinguished overseas and local guests

 Ladies and gentlemen

 Good evening, and thank you very much for inviting me to speak.

 As Patron of RUSI, it was a pleasure to host many of you at Government House for  the official opening yesterday, and it’s my honour to now participate in the seminar  proper.

 As a grandfather several times over, I’ve spent many hours thinking about the sort of  country and world my grandchildren are going to live in during the coming 60 or 70  years of their lives.

 I see many hopeful signs - and much to engender great optimism in our future.

 Within Australia, I see robust democratic parliaments, honest and capable courts, a  cohesive, integrated, genuinely multicultured society, and innovative streams of that  society - particularly in the medical, agricultural, military, environmental and  educational fields.

 Clearly, we have much to be proud of.

 Of course, we’re not without our challenges, but these are all manageable with good  governance and hard work.

 My concerns for my grandchildren relate more to the increasing plethora of global  problems that may well impact on Australia and its security situation.

 For example, I see a world:

 â¢ many of whose countries will come under increasing pressure through a lack  of adequate fresh water

 â¢ of nation states formed as a result of the post-World War II carve-up  themselves breaking up into their old tribal boundaries and hatreds

 â¢ of massive movements of refugees across land borders displaced by war,  hunger and disease

 â¢ many of these new national groupings - rife with endemic and systemic  corruption - operating without the rule of law, bringing poverty and misery to  their peoples as a result

 â¢ and many of whose countries do not have the tools to handle globalisation and  IT.

 Concurrent with all this are the migration of HIV/AIDS and the resurgence of  diseases - such as malaria - that we thought had been brought under control.

 Unfortunately, many of these difficulties are common to countries in our region.

 Of concern to us all is the spread of global terrorism, which - by its very nature - is  fanatical and, therefore, not amenable to negotiation towards peaceful outcomes.

 Ladies and gentlemen.

 These are just some of the wider, global issues facing Australia in 2003.

 Of course, governments in this country have properly recognised these and many  other pressing issues - and they’re addressing them.

 I hope that you, too - given the very broad theme of this International Seminar - will  give deep thought to these topics this week.

 The key thing is that - irrespective of one’s specific role in the policymaking process  - we must together recognise that the flipside of every challenge is an opportunity.

 In order not just to survive, but to maintain prosperity, contentment and general  wellbeing, we need to respond to challenges with a creative, integrated mix of  policies.

 Geographically, for example, how are we to take advantage of our position at the  centre of an arc embracing India in the north-west, extending via the archipelago to  China?

 In turning to more specific security issues, I don’t want to deal with the normal threat  assessment, force structure response, because in terms of our long-term survival and  prosperity, I think there are several other wider implications we should think about  that might be worthy of discussion by RUSI.

 The first is to engender in the whole of Australian society a desire to belong to a  country that is seen as a “Nation of Excellence”.

 By this I mean that whatever we do, we try to do better than the rest of the world.

 For example, we should take pride in producing the best plumbers, electricians,  teachers, nurses, scientists, farmers, engineers, soldiers and artists.

 In so doing, we could produce in future generations a society and a nation that is 

 looked upon with admiration and respect by those countries in that arc I just referred  to and, indeed, the rest of the world.

 Of critical importance will be the requirement to remain a nation functioning under  the rule of law - so that our democracy flourishes through the continuing integrity of  its parliamentary, judicial and public service institutions, and that that example is seen  and respected by the arc and the rest of the world.

 The second matter for possible discussion - and this has already been recognised by  the Government - is to take the opportunity to support reform of the Security Council  of the United Nations.

 It seems to me that if the world does not want a superpower of the day to take  unilateral or multilateral action against threats that it perceives to be inimical to its  national interest, then the UN must be given the authority and the appropriate tools to  ensure that human rights and the dignity of the individual under Article 10 are  maintained.

 In time, this may require the UN to consider cooperative, interventionist action in  potential or active trouble spots with a view to pre-empting the genocidal bloodbaths  that we have witnessed in parts of Africa, Europe, the Middle East and, indeed, our  own region.

 It may well be that the East Timor and Solomon Islands examples will provide  possible models for UN intervention.

 A third consideration is to continue to develop, maintain and strengthen links and  dialogue with strategic-partner countries - such as the United States.

 We share many values with the US, and we have mutually reinforcing interests -  interests that, importantly, needn’t conflict with our building up strong relations with  countries, such as Indonesia, in our more immediate region.

 It’s also important that such alliances be nurtured for dealing with global terror and  other short-notice problems that can, do and will arise from time to time.

 The last suggested area of focus is enhancing our linkage to the India/China arc - a  region that, as I hinted at earlier, represents a huge opportunity for Australia.

 It’s possible that within the next 60 or so years, we will see the rise of one or both of  these countries as superpowers or near equivalents.

 So it seems to me that Australia’s direct interests require us to link in every way we  can with those two countries - economically, diplomatically, militarily and so on.

 Ladies and gentlemen.

 I’d now like to turn my mind to some of the more conventionally defined aspects of  security - issues that I know are of primary interest to RUSI and many of you here  tonight.

 Patently, we need an Australian Defence Force - and I’m attracted to the concept put  forward by Dr Michael Evans of the Land Warfare Studies Centre Duntroon that such 

 a force should be simultaneously globally attuned, regionally focussed and alliance-oriented.

 The past 13 years or so have been one of the most active periods for the ADF in  recent history - for example, the Gulf (twice), Papua New Guinea, Bougainville, East  Timor, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Sydney Olympic Games, CHOGM and the Solomons -  and there are no signs of a let-up.

 Of all these deployments, only the Olympics and CHOGM were predictable - and at  home.

 We can reasonably anticipate that - in the foreseeable future - Australian forces may  need to conduct more of the same in support of three fundamental security objectives.

 The first objective is continuing participation in so-called coalition operations -  including the UN - as they arise: such as the Gulf, East Timor, Afghanistan and, more  recently, in Iraq.

 Incidentally, I think the ADF has acquitted itself extremely well in all theatres.

 It thoroughly deserves the plaudits it has received for its professionalism, flexibility  and coolness in widely differing, complex and volatile situations.

 These sorts of coalition operations are not the kind we can always predict or plan for  specifically.

 But each has required deployable and sustainable high-technology forces with  genuine combat power - available at short notice - to fit in seamlessly with coalition  partners, and with offshore-deployment and logistic capabilities.

 The second imperative is to respond to problems and crises nearer to home - such as  we did in Bougainville and East Timor, and we’re now doing in the Solomon Islands.

 I think our highly admirable efforts in the Solomons with our regional partners have a  wider significance, and I’ll come back to that in a moment.

 The third main - and ongoing - call on our security forces will be to help deal with  the continuing scourge of global terrorism.

 Senseless, barbaric, criminal acts of terror have been perpetrated against Australians  and our friends abroad - especially in Indonesia -  and we’ll be reminded of one of  the worst instances during remembrance ceremonies for the Bali bombing from this  coming weekend.

 It seems to me the fight against terror will be our foremost predictable challenge and  - as Senator Hill suggested recently - we can expect further incidents.

 There are no easy answers to the problem of terrorism - and we shouldn’t delude  ourselves that patient, thoughtful arguments against the futility and destructiveness of  violence will eventually win over hardened fanatics.

 Terrorists must be ruthlessly pursued - both domestically and internationally - under  the aegis of high-grade intelligence cooperation regionally and globally, the ready 

 availability of highly trained response forces, and prudent security measures on high-possibility targets.

 All the while, we should continue to stress, repeatedly, that violence in pursuit of  political, religious or cultural aims is wrong and simply never works - and that the  rule of law must always prevail.

 Throughout this process of building greater understanding, we must remember that  the continuation of calm dialogue is paramount - sensible discussion free of rancour  and ruinous polarisation.

 In this respect, I think spiritual leaders from across the globe - and across faiths -  could play a positive role in this debate.

 They could come together at regular, high-profile gatherings to denounce terrorism -  especially when such terrible actions are grotesquely characterised as part of a “holy  war”.

 Collectively, we must do more than simply watch - with resignation and a feeling of  powerlessness - reports on the evening news about the latest terrorist atrocity.

 Ladies and gentlemen.

 As I suggested earlier, I join all Australians in commending current Australian and  regional partner efforts to bring the Solomon Islands back from the brink.

 In its own way, the initiative is an example of excellence, and it stands as a model for  future operations - perhaps including ones carried out by the UN.

 Australia’s involvement, with its neighbours, has been part of a genuine regional  solution - endorsed by the Pacific Islands Forum - and we were invited to provide  assistance by the Solomon Islands Government itself.

 To me, the really enlightened aspect of the Regional Assistance Mission to the  Solomon Islands is that it’s a total plan - one that addresses not just the immediate  problems, such as the restoration of law and order, but also the deeper causes of  violence and institutional breakdown.

 It’s a graduated approach that has involved - over time - the support of Australian  police, the ADF, Department of Foreign Affairs officers, and economic advisers.

 I note, as well, that under their existing aid relationship, Australia and Papua New  Guinea will be working on a similarly broad basis to address some of PNG’s core  challenges, especially in the areas of governance, law and order, justice, financial  management, and the capacity of the public service.

 I believe that the sort of assistance we’re now providing to our Pacific neighbours is  time, effort and money well spent.

 Quite apart from it being the act of a friend during a time of crisis and hardship, I  would suggest it’s also in our own national interest to ensure our immediate region is  stable and not vulnerable to the rise of transnational crime, people-smuggling, health 

 epidemics and even terrorism.

 If Australia is going to become regularly involved in these short- to medium-term  direct commitments, the key challenge will be to ensure we have people equipped and  available to do the work.

 In this regard, I wonder whether there might be ways to encourage the formation of a  core of people - across a range of professions and trade skills - who have direct  knowledge and experience with the region.

 Junior police officers and soldiers, teachers and nurses, and bureaucrats and bankers,  could usefully spend time in countries such as PNG, or wider afield, and then return  for further stints as their careers progress.

 Their careers could develop in harmony with their overseas counterparts - creating a  sense of trust, friendship and mutual understanding.

 This could be a very effective way to share our specialist expertise and - by people  learning the local language and culture - develop a deeper understanding of these  countries.

 Of course, such an approach would involve a long-term commitment, agreement with  the countries concerned, and possible reciprocity.

 We’d have to resist falling on our sword if sometimes it went a bit off track.

 But with time and energy, I think such a grassroots approach could potentially foster  stronger trust and confidence among all concerned.

 Just as we demonstrated to our Asian trading partners during the Asian financial crisis  of the late 1990s, such a strategy would show that we are engaged in the region for  the long haul, and that we don’t intend to pull up stumps when the going gets tough.

 Ladies and gentlemen.

 I’ve sought to cover a lot of ground tonight. 

 In doing so, I’ve suggested several possible discussion areas, including that we should  aspire to be a “Nation of Excellence” - a nation of strong institutions, with a  profoundly democratic, tolerant, enterprising and outward-looking national psyche,  with close and enduring links to the India/China arc.

 Of course, values alone won’t provide a cast-iron guarantee of security and  prosperity.

 For this reason we’ll always need a vigilant, professional defence force - an offshore-deployable, well-equipped, sustainable force, capable of dealing with both the upper  and lower ends of the conflict spectrum.

 In raising a number of issues tonight, I want to emphasise that these don’t represent  policy options, nor are they topics solely within the province of government.

 I raise them in the context of the wide-ranging discussion taking place as part of this 

 Seminar, and RUSI’s continuing role as a forum for debate about security in the  broadest sense.

 Ladies and gentlemen.

 It’s been a great pleasure talking with you this evening, and I hope the remainder of  your Seminar proves rewarding and enjoyable.

 It’s now my very happy duty to propose a toast - a toast to the Royal United Services  Institute of Australia.

 Thank you.
