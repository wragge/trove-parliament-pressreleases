 Joint  Communique       2  December  2005  

 

 AMA Summit Participants Call for an End to Asylum Seeker and  Refugee Health Care Discrimination   

 Participants in the AMA Summit on the Health Care of Asylum Seekers and Refugees, held in  Canberra on 30 November, believe strongly that people seeking asylum within Australia have  the  right  to  receive  appropriate  medical  care  without  discrimination,  regardless  of  their   citizenship,  visa  status,  or  ability  to  pay.   Like  all  seeking  health  care,  asylum  seekers  and  

 refugees should be treated with compassion, respect, and dignity.   

 Currently, asylum seekers on certain bridging visas have no right to work, no income, and no  access to Medicare.  Yet some public hospitals are charging these people for their treatment.   

 This is unacceptable. Australia, as a fair and just society with a proud tradition of nurturing  the  oppressed,  should  provide  quality  health  services  for  these  people,  who  are  among  the   most vulnerable in our community.    

 We  commend  the  Victorian  Health  Minister,  Bronwyn  Pike,  for  her  recent  instruction  to   Victorian public hospitals to ensure that no asylum seeker should pay for medical treatment.    

 We call on all State and Territory health departments to follow the Victorian lead and ensure  that  no  asylum  seeker  is  charged  for  their  treatment  in  a  public  hospital.   Asylum  seekers   currently will not seek health care when they need it if they know there will be a cost they are  unable to pay.   

 

 Over 90 per cent of asylum seeker cases needing support from health and welfare agencies  are  ineligible  for  Medicare,  and  have  no  right  to  work  or  use  Centrelink.   These  people   include  women  and  children.   The  current  visa  system  fails  to  answer  important  questions   such as:  Where are pregnant asylum seeker women going to give birth? Where can they and  their  new  baby  live  on  no  income? How  does  a  man  with  a  severed  finger  get  medical   attention?   

 The Government’s announcement of new MBS health checks for refugees from May 2006 is  a welcome move and a good first step; however, general practitioners shouldn’t alone have to  shoulder the responsibility for health care.   

 Refugees with access to Medicare still find obtaining health care - preventative or curative -  extremely difficult, partly because they do not understand the system.   

 We  consider  that  assisting  new  arrivals  during  the  settling-in  period,  and  helping  them  to   develop a continuing relationship with a medical practitioner, is a worthwhile investment by  government.   Appropriate  health  checks  and  follow-up  ensure  good  health  for  these  new   members of the Australian community, and help prevent costly medical interventions in the  future.   

 We, the undersigned, offer to work with government to resolve the problems that presently  exist in asylum seeker and refugee health care.  …/2
