 TURNBULL DOORSTOP - KEVIN RUDD’S CHAOTIC BORDER PROTECTION  POLICY 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Kevin Rudd has to come into the Parliament today and explain what is going on with his bungled, chaotic debacle 

 of a failed policy on border protection. This is not a policy. It is a shambles. And it is Kevin Rudd’s doing, every bit 

 of it.  

 He unpicked the border protection policies of the previous government, policies that resulted in the flow of boats 

 dwindling to barely a trickle and now we have had over 2,000 unauthorised arrivals since he changed the 

 policies. His so called ‘Indonesian Solution’ is a shambles. He’s got the local government objecting, refusing 

 saying they won’t be a dumping ground for asylum seekers. Potentially the Indonesian President may be able to 

 overrule them. It is a complete debacle.  

 Mr Rudd denies any knowledge of it now. He couldn’t remember anything in Parliament yesterday. He didn’t 

 seem to know which part of the Australian Government was actually giving directions to the Oceanic Viking. The 

 whole thing is incredible. It is unbelievable that an Australian Government could create such a policy shambles 

 on something as important as border protection. He has let our border protection fall into chaos. And it is all his 

 doing and he has to explain himself.  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull who should take the asylum seekers, Indonesia or Australia, on board Viking?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 This is the question you should ask Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd said they were going to Indonesia. He said he had an 

 arrangement that they would be disembarked in Indonesia. It has been nine or ten days now they’ve been stuck 

 on this boat, this Customs vessel that has other duties, I might add.  

 So it is a colossal policy failure and really Mr Rudd has got to answer these questions. He has got to start 

 remembering his own role. It was extraordinary in the House yesterday when he said he just couldn’t recall what 

 had been going on. It is perfectly obvious that the Oceanic Viking is a top priority for him at the moment and if it is 

 not, it should be, and yet he tries to convince the Australian people he doesn’t know anything about it.  

 QUESTION:  

 Does Indonesia need more money do you think?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well you’d have to ask Mr Rudd that or the Indonesians that. Look, ultimately political policies are judged on 

 results. The previous government’s policies worked. What is the object of the policy in this area? It is to treat 

 refugees, asylum seekers, humanely and generously in accordance with the UN convention and to ensure that 

 our borders are protected and as far as practicable we don’t have any unauthorised arrivals, maritime arrivals. So 

 those are the two goals.  

 Now Mr Rudd’s policy seems to be despatching the asylum seekers into conditions in Indonesia which in many 

 cases are far from satisfactory. So that’s hardly generous or humane. And at the same time by unpicking the 

 domestic policies, the Australian side of the border protection policies, he has created this huge marketing 

 opportunity for the people smugglers and as we have seen they have used that marketing opportunity inevitably, 

 and we have had this huge increase to over 2,000 arrivals since last August.  

 Whichever way you look at his policy it is a colossal failure. Now what he has got to do is acknowledge that it has 

 failed, acknowledge that it is not working and start addressing it and answering some questions.  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull I don’t think there’s any doubt that the onus is on the Government to fix this problem and it is a 

 massive debacle. But the thing I’m struggling with is you are saying that it is the change in policy that is causing 

 these problems, but that change is something that you voted for and in the same breath you are saying that you 

 don’t want to bring back a Pacific Solution. So where exactly do you stand on this?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well where we stand is to hold the Government to account. Let’s be quite clear about this. Mr Rudd has always 

 said that the policy changes he effected - there’s a whole range of them, you all know what they are - would 

 have no impact whatsoever on arrivals. And he still insists that. He said it is just a complete coincidence that 

 Australia’s policies were changed by him and then suddenly… well it began slowly and now it is developing into a 

 flood of arrivals.  

 Now the fact is everybody knows it is his doing. He changed, recklessly - against the advice of the Federal 

 Police, against the advice of the Opposition - he unpicked the fabric of the Coalition’s border protection policy, a 

 policy that worked and he replaced it, not with a workable policy, but with chaos.  

 He is achieving neither objective. His policy is neither tough nor humane. It is just chaos and a shambles. And the 

 opportunity now, the duty now for Mr Rudd is to come into the Parliament and explain himself. That’s what he has 

 to do today. Thanks very much.
