 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania    

 Labor hamstrung by internal divisions on climate  change - Greens  5th Jan 2006  Kim Beazley’s Labor must overcome huge internal divisions if Labor is to  adequately tackle the impact of climate change on Australia this century,  Greens leader, Bob Brown said in Hobart today.  Welcoming shadow environment minister Anthony Albanese’s call for  Australia to take environmental refugees from the Pacific, Senator Brown  said this was, however a ‘but not yet’ policy. He said Labor had voted  against Greens Senator Christine Milne’s motion calling for recognition of  such refugees just 2 months ago. The motion, which Labor joined the  Government to oppose read:  That the Senate—   (a) recognises:   (i) the impacts of climate change are already destroying fresh water  supplies in the Pacific region, and   (ii) that climate change and increased frequency of extreme weather  events are likely to lead to displacement of people;  (b) notes that people displaced by climate change are not currently  regarded as refugees; and   (c) calls on the Government to incorporate a definition of environmental  refugee into the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.  Senator Brown said the old parties were hamstrung by last century  thinking, and by the powerful coal lobby.  "Labor is challenged to change its own outdated core policies to:  â¢ impose polluter-pays levies (such as a carbon tax) and use the revenue  to boost Australia’s job-rich renewable energy and energy efficiency  sectors;  â¢ put an immediate halt to burning the nation’s biggest hedge against  global warming - including the tall forests of Tasmania, East Gippsland  and southeast NSW;  â¢ expand the terms of reference of a regional climate monitoring centre to  include redressing the social injustice of wealthy countries generating sea  rises and more catastrophic storms through greenhouse gas production,"  Senator Brown said 

 Senator Brown challenged Labor to emulate the Greens in establishing a  specific portfolio for climate change and global warming. The Greens  spokesperson is Senator Milne.  "[E]ither we, as a nation, are going to be outgoing and giving to the rest of  the planet;…or we are going to be recipients of at least part of the  enormous mass migrations which are going to occur…in the coming  century… [I]f we do not rein in the greenhouse gas phenomenon one  billion people on this planet will be displaced if the oceans rise by a metre  at the end of the next century." (Senator Bob Brown, First Speech, 9 Sept  1996)
