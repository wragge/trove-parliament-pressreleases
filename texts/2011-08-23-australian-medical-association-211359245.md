 MANDATORY DETENTION IS HARMFUL TO THE PHYSICAL AND  MENTAL HEALTH OF ASYLUM SEEKERS   

 AMA POSITION STATEMENT - HEALTH CARE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AND  REFUGEES (2011)   

 The AMA has updated its Position Statement on the Health Care of Asylum Seekers and  Refugees.    

 AMA President, Dr Steve Hambleton, said today that the AMA’s position is that detention  centres are harmful to the physical and mental health of asylum seekers - especially children.    

 “We have been raising concerns about the health of asylum seekers for over a decade,” Dr  Hambleton said.   

 “The Position Statement has been updated to reflect current circumstances.   

 “Despite improvements in the provision of health care to immigration detainees, the policy of  mandatory detention and the remote location of most detainees mean that the health status of  detainees continues to decline.   

 “The AMA is clearly focused on the health aspects of the asylum seeker debate, which also  touch on human rights, ethics, and the right thing to do.   

 “These are damaged people desperately seeking a new life in this country.  They are often  fleeing diabolical situations in their home country.  They are well acquainted with fear and  danger and desperation.  Some of them have been through torture, some have physical health  problems, and many will have experienced mental health pressures.    

 “The risk of mental health issues becomes higher the longer they are in detention centres.   

 “Children are particularly vulnerable and the detention environment places enormous stress on  them.   

 “Children often witness behavioural and psychological distress in adults, including their  parents.  They see violence and self-harm and they experience separation from family  members.   

 “Unaccompanied children should never be placed in detention centres,” Dr Hambleton said.

 Health Care of Asylum Seekers and Refugees - 2011   

 Preamble   The Australian Medical Association affirms that those who are seeking, or who have been  granted, asylum within Australia have the right to receive appropriate medical care without  discrimination, regardless of citizenship, visa status, or ability to pay. Like all seeking health  care, asylum seekers and refugees in Australia should be treated with compassion, respect,  and dignity.   

 Definitions   The United Nation's 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Refugee  Convention), and the 1967 amendment entitled the Protocol Relating to Refugees, to both of  which Australia is a signatory, define refugees as persons who are: 

 â¢ outside their country of nationality or their usual country of residence, and  

 â¢ unable or unwilling to return or to seek the protection of that country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of  a particular social group, or political opinion, and 

 â¢ not war criminals or people who have committed serious non-political crimes. 

 Asylum seekers are people who apply to the Government of a country for recognition as a  refugee. 

 

 The AMA makes the following observations and recommendations in relation to the  health care of asylum seekers and refugees:   

 Health and Welfare of Asylum Seekers and Refugees    

 1. In addition to suffering the same health problems as the general population, asylum seekers  and refugees are at particular risk from a range of conditions including psychological  disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and the physical effects  of persecution and torture. They may also often suffer the effects of poor dental hygiene, poor  nutrition and diet, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, which may be more common  in their countries of origin.   

 2. To determine their specific health needs, all asylum seekers and refugees should undergo  comprehensive and timely health assessments in a culturally appropriate manner by suitably  trained medical practitioners as part of a primary health care team. This assessment will be  used to establish ongoing care.   

 3. All asylum seekers and refugees should have access to the same level of health care as all  Australian citizens. In addition, it should be ensured that their special needs, including  cultural, linguistic, and health-related, are addressed. 

 

 4. A national statutory body of clinical experts independent of governments should be  established with the power to investigate and advise regarding the health and welfare of  asylum seekers and refugees.   

 

 AMA Position Statement

 5. All asylum seekers and refugees, independent of their citizenship or visa status, should  have universal access to basic health care, counseling and educational and training  opportunities. Refugees and asylum seekers living in the community should also have access 

 to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), state welfare and employment  support, and appropriate settlement services.  Immigration policies that restrict the social and  economic rights of disadvantaged groups of people, such as asylum seekers and refugees, can  have adverse impacts on their health and wellbeing.   

 6. Health and welfare services for asylum seekers in detention and in the community should  be adequately resourced and integrated at State and Federal level. This includes staff  education, training, and support.   

 7. Refugees, and asylum seekers living in the community, should have continued access to  culturally appropriate health care, including specialist care, to meet their ongoing health  needs, including rehabilitation.    

 8. More research is needed into the health status and health care of asylum seekers and  refugees, both within the community and in detention centres, to assist medical practitioners  in the care of these groups, and the development of appropriate services.   

 9. More research is needed into the impact of immigration controls, such as the prolonged,  indeterminate use of detention, on the health of asylum seekers, including those eventually  determined to be refugees.   

 Medical Practitioners   

 10. Medical practitioners should:  â¢ act in the best interests of the patient;  â¢ not authorise or approve any physical punishment, nor participate in any form of  inhumane treatment, nor be called upon to do so by authorities; and  â¢ provide medical treatment in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.    

 11. Medical practitioners should at all times insist that the rights of their patients be respected  and not allow lower standards of care to be provided. In particular, the right to privacy and  confidentiality must be protected.   

 12. Appropriate medical treatment teams should include members with the skills outlined  above. Medical practitioners providing full assessment of asylum seekers and refugees should  be suitably trained in: 

 â¢ identifying victims of torture and assessment and management of related trauma; 

 â¢ identification of suicide risk, screening for mental health conditions (including among  children and adolescents) and monitoring and management of these conditions;  

 â¢ responding to the medical, physical, emotional, and developmental needs of children and  families; and 

 â¢ recognising particular health-related conditions which may be more common in an  asylum seeker's or refugee's home country than here in Australia (eg. tuberculosis).

 13. Professional medical organisations should develop a set of ethical guidelines to support  medical practitioners working with asylum seekers and refugees in whatever context.   

 Issues Specific to Asylum Seekers    

 Asylum seekers are generally not afforded the same rights as refugees. They are often not  given the same access to freedom of movement, to work, or to medical care. These  restrictions can adversely affect health and wellbeing, particularly mental health. Issues  specific to immigration detention centres are addressed below.    

 Immigration Detention Centres    

 14. Prolonged, indeterminate detention of asylum seekers in immigration detention centres  violates basic human rights and contributes adversely to health. The longer a person is in  detention, the higher their risk of mental illness. Detention in immigration detention centres  should be used only as a last resort, and for the shortest practicable time. Solutions to  prolonged, indeterminate detention must be sought as a matter of urgency.   

 15. In order that asylum seekers do not spend a prolonged, indeterminate period of time in  detention, the Government must set in law an absolute maximum duration that an asylum  seeker can spend in detention. After such time, the asylum seeker should be allowed to live in  the community while their visa application continues to be assessed. The determination of an  absolute maximum time that asylum seekers can spend in detention must be undertaken with  appropriate public consultation.   

 16. Where immigration detention centres continue to be used to detain asylum seekers,  governments must provide basic humane standards of living conditions. They must strive to  achieve world's best practice in all Australian detention centres, whether located within  Australia or offshore. This includes accommodating the health, linguistic, cultural, social,  educational, privacy, gender-specific and religious needs of asylum seekers.   

 17. Health and medical services in immigration detention centres should only be provided by  organizations that have the full capacity to provide an appropriate range of health and  medical care to all detainees as needed, and according to best practice standards in health care  delivery (as would apply in the general community).  Adherence to these standards should be  guaranteed through a process of ongoing monitoring of detainees health by an independent  statutory body of clinical experts with powers to acquire information and investigate  conditions in centres as it determines.   

 18. The assessment and provision of medical care to asylum seekers in detention must be  undertaken by medical practitioners.   

 19. Health screening should be undertaken by a medical practitioner or a nurse. Health  screening for addictive, physical, and psychiatric problems, including potential suicide risk,  should occur on admission to the centre. All significant medical findings should be referred  immediately to a medical practitioner.   

 20. Medications should be administered by medical professionals or nurses and not detention  centre staff, and provisions should be in place for the appropriate management of detainees’  medications.

 21. Detention center staff and management should ensure that the instructions provided by  medical practitioners for the health and wellbeing of detainees are implemented.   

 22. Doctors providing services in immigration detention centres should be experienced  medical professionals. Where junior doctors are contracted, they must have available to them  appropriate medical professional support and advice, and their welfare should be ensured.   

 23. Continuity of medical care for detainees should be ensured as much as is reasonably  possible and steps should be taken to avoid a high turnover of medical and other staff in  services provided to detainees.   

 24. Reviews of detainees’ health status must occur regularly.   

 25. The provision of health care is potentially constrained due to the physical and social  environment of detention centres, particularly those located 'offshore'. Those in detention  should have timely access to good quality ongoing health care, including emergency and 

 specialist services, to the same standard as is available to Australian citizens. Those who  require assessment or treatment that cannot be undertaken within the detention centre  environment should be transferred to an appropriate centre in a timely manner. 

 

 26. Those in detention should have access to appropriate specialist services including  obstetric and gynaecological services, antenatal and postnatal care, paediatric services,  mental health, rehabilitation, allied health services, and dental services.   

 27. Continuity of care needs to be maintained for refugees and asylum seekers released into  the community. They should be fully informed about the Medicare and PBS schemes and  how to access the full range of health care and medical options available in the community.  Provision must also be made for ongoing social support services in the community when an  asylum seeker is released.   

 28. Individuals who are released into the community must have timely access to their medical  records from their time in detention. Those who are deported should receive a copy of their  medical record from their time in detention to take with them. 

 

 29. Any measure to reintroduce Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) must be opposed. These  visas impose undue stress and anxiety on individuals because they cannot apply for  permanent visas and are unable to travel in and out of Australia, or access family reunion  schemes. TPVs undermine the ability to successfully integrate into the community.   

 30. All asylum seekers and refugees should be afforded access to Government support  services, including entitlement to family reunion and settlement services.   

 Children    

 31. Children are particularly vulnerable and the detention environment places enormous  stress on them. Children often witness behavioural and psychological distress in adults,  including their parents, violence and self-harm, and experience separation from family  members.   

 32. Children appear to be at particular risk of sexual violence.

 33. An unaccompanied child should never be placed in detention.   

 34. An accompanied child should be kept in detention for the shortest possible time, but no  more than one month. By the end of one month, a suitable placement for the child with at  least one adult family member must be identified.   

 35. Children and their families should never be placed among the general detention centre  community, but should reside in a separate living area.   

 Hunger Strikers    

 36. The AMA believes that the detention centre environment should never become so  intolerable that asylum seekers would consider going on a hunger strike as a means of  protesting about their living conditions. Similarly, visa-processing procedures should be  expedited to avoid self-harm due to frustration.   

 37. Where an individual voluntarily refuses nourishment and is considered by a medical  practitioner to be capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment concerning the  consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment, the practitioner should be free to  refuse to co-operate in artificial feeding. The decision as to the capacity of the individual to  form such a judgment should be confirmed by at least one other independent medical  practitioner. The practitioners must explain to the individual the consequences of refusal of  nourishment.   

 38. Doctors should become involved with the hunger strikers before, or immediately upon  commencement, of a hunger strike in order to continually assess the hunger striker's physical  and mental health, counsel the hunger striker regarding the adverse health effects associated  with going on a hunger strike, and discuss with the hunger striker his/her wishes regarding  artificial nutrition/hydration should he/she lose decision-making capacity. Health staff should  have free and unfettered access to hunger strikers.   

 39. In accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration on Hunger Strikers  (Declaration of Malta), if the hunger striker loses decision-making capacity, the doctor must  be free to make treatment decisions that he/she considers to be in the best interests of that 

 particular individual.   

 40. It is recognised that an individual who takes part in a group hunger strike may feel  pressured by the other participants to continue the strike, even if he/she does not want to  continue. A hunger striker must be allowed to withdraw from the hunger strike at any time,  for any reason.
