 Democrats want answers Australian Democrats’ Leader, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said last night’s Four Corners program confirmed the worst suspicions about the treatment of asylum seekers trying to reach Australian shores.

 “The footage on the program was devastating and the stories of those seeking asylum were deeply shocking,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 “Finally, Australians have the opportunity to hear the stories from the people that the Government has been attempting to dehumanise.

 “From the outset the Democrats were asking questions about the Government’s version of events of the so-called Children Overboard incident. We were instrumental in highlighting the role of the Prime Minister in the refugee issue last year.

 “Now we hear allegations about a refusal to allow full medical treatment, in addition to the use of capsicum spray by the military on people who were traumatised and dehydrated and unwell.

 “The Democrats, through our Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, will continue to seek answers on the Government’s role in politicising the defence forces and on the military’s treatment of these people,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 Senator Bartlett, who is on the Children Overboard Inquiry, said that Australians want to know the answers to these questions.

 “As more facts come to light, Australians are becoming increasingly disturbed at the role of Government and the way it has directed the defence forces to treat asylum seekers.

 “Many of the revelations on Four Corners are consistent with information that has been provided by witnesses to the Inquiry,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The community is not going to be fobbed off by the half truths and misinformation that this Government continues to spread on this issue,” concluded Senator Stott Despoja.
