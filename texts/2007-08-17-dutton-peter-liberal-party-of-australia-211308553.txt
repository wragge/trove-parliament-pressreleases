 NO.102 

 Friday 17 August 2007 

 DEDUCTIBILITY OF GIFTS TO  AUSTRALIA FOR UNHCR  Today, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Peter Dutton, has  announced that the Government has decided to amend the income tax law to extend  the period during which tax deductible gifts to the value of $2 or more can be made to  Australia for UNHCR. 

 As a result, gifts made to Australia for UNHCR after 27 June 2007 and before  28 June 2012 will be tax deductible. 

 Australia for UNHCR was established to raise funds to conduct education, promotion,  and fundraising activities in Australia to support the work of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees. 

 Taxpayers should ensure they receive a receipt for their donation. 

 Legislation to give effect to the Governmentâ€™s decision will be introduced as soon as  practicable.
