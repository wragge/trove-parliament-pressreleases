 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 12 June 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MR. SCOTT MORRISON MHR,  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP  NAURU   

 Subjects: Visit to Nauru; Labor’s Malaysian people swap; Julia Gillard’s carbon tax.   

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

  TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m here at Nauru Hospital with Scott Morrison. It has been good to be taken around the island by Kieren  Keke, the Foreign Minister, and to see what sort of infrastructure is available here on Nauru to deal with  possible boat people from Australia. Plainly, the physical infrastructure at the old processing centre - the  State House processing centre - is sound. There is an excellent school, there is obviously a strong police  presence on the island, there are good health facilities, there’s plenty of power and there’s plenty of water.  So, all the infrastructure for successfully and effectively hosting a processing centre is present. In fact, the  infrastructure on the island today is vastly better than the infrastructure on the island ten years ago when the  processing centre was first set up by the Australian Government.    

 So, compared to Malaysia, Nauru is humane, cost-effective and proven - and that’s why I say that the Prime  Minister should pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and reopen this centre. It’s humane, it’s cost-effective and it’s proven, unlike Malaysia, and I would challenge the Immigration Minister to go around and  show to the Australian people the centre, the hospital, the education and the justice facilities that boat people  from Australia would enjoy in Malaysia and I don’t believe that Chris Bowen can do that. If Chris Bowen  and Julia Gillard were fair dinkum, they would be able to take people from Australia now and show them the  housing, the health facilities, the education facilities and the justice facilities that boat people from Australia  would enjoy in Malaysia and I don’t think they can do that but obviously Scott and I have been able to do  that here in Nauru. So, again, I really think that this is clear evidence, if any is needed, that by far the best  way to stop the boats is to reopen this centre here in Nauru in conjunction with temporary protection visas.    

 Scott, would you like to say a few words?   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 I’d just add one point. The other thing that Tony and I have appreciated this morning with the Nauruan  people and that is just how warm and friendly and hospitable and a generous people they are. That’s the  people who will welcome those who would come as illegal arrivals from Australia and this is important.  Australia would need to be confident of the treatment of people who would end up in Nauru under our  processing centre proposal and having been here before and enjoyed their hospitality and their generosity

 and being here again with Tony today and meeting so many of the locals, particularly this morning -  beautiful people, and a generous heart and a generous nature.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, there’s talk of the Malaysian solution being finalised either today or tomorrow and if that were  to happen and [inaudible] showed dividends and there was a drop off in boat arrivals and you were elected  in the next, say, eighteen months, would you commit to opening Nauru once again regardless of the result of  the Malaysian solution?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, there is no solution in Malaysia, there is no solution. What we’ve had from this Government is an  announcement, we haven’t had a deal and given this Government’s appalling record of making  announcements and not being able to do a deal, I will believe anything when it is actually happening.    

 QUESTION:   

 You say that it would be more humane here, presumably than Malaysia, but under the Pacific Solution in  2005, Amanda Vanstone brought back the last 25 of 27 partially because of the report from psychiatrists  saying that it was damaging to their mental health for them to continue for one more day sitting on Nauru.  How is it humane to keep them in that sort of a situation?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I think that any form of denial to boat people of what they are wanting, namely permanent residency in  Australia, is obviously a shock and I don’t think the Government can say for a second that there would be  fewer mental health problems in Malaysia. I mean, imagine taking boat people from Australia to Malaysia  where they will be exposed almost inevitably to the prospect of caning, where they will be at the back of the  queue in a very uncertain humanitarian [inaudible]…   

 QUESTION:    

 Is that acceptable for you, though, that an unfortunate consequence of the policy will be that people’s mental  health will be damaged?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the truth is that anyone who is denied what he or she is desperately seeking is unlikely to be pleased -  that’s just a simple fact of human nature. But it is absolutely clear that people who were taken from  Australia to Nauru would be treated humanely, they would be well-housed, they would be well-fed, they  would be well-taught, [inaudible] well looked after because the facilities on this island exist and they would  obviously be improved if the processing centre was to be reopened and it would all be done [inaudible] in  accordance with Australian standards. We know how to treat people well. I don’t think there can be any  similar guarantees about people being taken to Malaysia, put into a centre and then tagged.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 [inaudible] end up leaving Nauru either to get back to their home country or whether they need to be  resettled. Now, the issue with Malaysia is that after six weeks [inaudible] will go into the community and 

 3 

 

 there is nothing suggested at present as to where they will be, what access to facilities there will be, what  tracking there will be and how long they will end up staying there. I think there is the issue of detention and  there is the issue of where it is and I’ve visited detention centres all around Australia where people are now  spending three times the amount of time in detention than they were just two years ago. So, I have no doubt  that as far as the processing facility here on Nauru, the challenges would be as well met here, if not better,  than they potentially would be in a mainland centre.    

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible]…express reservations about reopening Manus Island. Presumably, you’d need UNHCR approval  or involvement to reopen Nauru. If that didn’t come through are you prepared, if you took government, to  have Australian immigration [inaudible] running the centre and doing the processing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, the short answer is yes. To reopen the centre in Nauru it simply requires the agreement of the Nauruan  Government and it’s pretty clear that that agreement would be forthcoming.    

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I can’t understand why Prime Minister Gillard is so resistant to making use of Nauru because, as  we’ve seen today, Nauru is an extremely welcoming country and Nauru has much better facilities for  hosting a processing centre now than it did ten years ago and the only reason that I can think of for the Prime  Minister to resist Nauru is because John Howard thought of it first and I think it’s really unfortunate that the  pride and stubbornness of our Prime Minister is preventing the obvious, logical way to best stop the boats  and I think if the Prime Minister was prepared  to swallow her pride, stop being so stubborn, this centre here  in Nauru could be reopened within weeks and we would have a very, very good chance - particularly if  temporary protection visas were brought in as well - of stopping the boats swiftly.   

 QUESTION:   

 How long would you expect people to be detained here?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the important thing is that they are going to be looked after well for as long as it takes. Now, I don’t  pretend that people could necessarily be in and out of here in a short time.  The important thing, though, is to  stop the boats and Nauru did stop the boats. There were essentially three factors in the former government  stopping the boats: first of all, offshore processing in third countries; second, temporary protection visas;  and third, a readiness to turn boats around where that could be done safely. Now, all three elements are  necessary if the boats are to be stopped but plainly, the key to doing this is Nauru and that’s why I say the  Prime Minister should pick up the phone.    

 QUESTION:   

 If the UNHCR [inaudible] won’t that ultimately mean that asylum seekers will end up back in Australia if  there’s no other resettlement countries involved in the framework?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 4 

 

 No, I don’t think you should assume that. Certainly, when Nauru was open before, 30 per cent of people  who came here eventually went back to their original country and another 30 per cent got third country  resettlement.   

 QUESTION:   

 I know you’ve said that it will cost less than the $300 million, can you give a more precise estimate of how  much, having seen the facility today, how much it might take to refurbish them [inaudible]…   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I’m not a quantity surveyor, so I can’t just glance at a site and say it’ll be ‘x million’ on one, but I  think all of us can see that the basic structures are sound at the State House centre. The most important and  the most expensive facilities there are things like the kitchens, they’ve got a commercial kitchen that’s still  functioning there. I would imagine that in a period of weeks at most it could be brought back up to a  standard to accommodate people and, as I said, they would then be well-housed, well-schooled, well looked  after particularly if they are sick and it would all be done in accordance with Australian standards which is  why I say that compared to Malaysia, Nauru is humane, cost-effective and proven.    

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible]    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, Australia has already committed quite a bit of funding to this centre and we’ve just seen an almost  brand new dental clinic which is new courtesy of the Australian Government but you’ve got essentially this  misapprehension that Australian boat people sent to Malaysia would somehow get five star treatment by  Malaysian standards. Well, plainly that’s not going to be the case. They will be detained, they will be  tagged, they will be let out into the community and in the Malaysian community, people of uncertain  immigration status are treated very, very harshly indeed and what is supposed to protect people in Malaysia  from caning and other very harsh treatment is this tag. Well, I mean, the Government has a lot more faith in  tags than I think most people would have.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Can I just add two points to that question and that is what we saw today, particularly with the police facility  that we saw under construction, what we saw with the secondary school that was built with Australian  taxpayers dollars under the AusAid programme and also what we’ve seen here at this hospital today, all of  these facilities, and particularly the one we see here today, is better than currently what’s on Christmas  Island, particularly when it comes to maternal health. Four hundred babies are delivered here every year and  the experience of the midwives and the paediatricians and the surgeons, there are all of the skills that are  necessary to support a population going into a processing centre which, frankly, doesn’t exist on Christmas  Island now where people have to be medevaced to have babies. So, one of the things I found out of today’s  meeting is reassurance of the level of support - not just the facilities that require cosmetic improvement of  the centre but the support facilities that are here - in the school, in the police, in the hospital.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I really would want to challenge the Prime Minister and the Immigration Minister - if they are fair dinkum  about Malaysia - to take a party of Australian journalists to the centre where boat people are proposed to be  housed, to the schools where boat people are proposed to be educated, to the hospitals where boat people are  proposed to be looked after and to the police facilities where boat people are proposed to be dealt with in  Malaysia. Now, as I said, what this Government is proposing is to take boat people from Christmas Island, 

 5 

 

 detain them, tag them and then expect that they’re not going to get caned. Well, really and truly, this is not a  plausible story from a Government which is much better at making statements than it is at actually  delivering upon them; which is much better at making promises than it is at keeping its word.    

 QUESTION:   

 Can I just ask one question on the carbon tax? The Government today has promised that pensioners will get  an upfront payment to compensate for the effects of the carbon tax and that their periodic payments will be  indexed above and beyond. We still don’t have any figures but isn’t that a clear indication that the  Government is prepared to fully compensate, over-compensate, pensioners for the cost of the carbon tax?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, this is typical of a government which is all about managing the media and not about delivering good  outcomes for the Australian people. This is just more speculation from a government which just can’t be  trusted. Let’s never forget, this was the Prime Minister who said six days before the last election ‘there will  be no carbon tax under the government I lead’ and now every Australian is going to be hit by a carbon tax.    

 So you just can’t trust this Government, you can’t trust this Prime Minister and the one point I make, finally,  is that the only certainty about this carbon tax if it comes in, whatever level it starts at, it will just go up and  up and up and up and there is no compensation which is going to be adequate for the levels of the carbon tax  which the Greens will demand and which will be needed if we’re going to drive a shift from coal to gas and  ultimately from gas to renewables.    

 Thank you.
