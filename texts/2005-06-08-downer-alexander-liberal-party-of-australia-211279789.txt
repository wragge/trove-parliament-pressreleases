 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: June 8 2005  

 

 TITLE: Press Conference - India   

 

 Downer: Thanks very much High Commissioner and ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say  what a great pleasure it is for me today to be in New Delhi. I had a very good meeting with  the Foreign Minister which was in the context of our annual Australia-India Foreign Ministers  framework dialogue. This was the fourth round of that dialogue and it was an opportunity for  us both to have a look at where we are going in terms of the bilateral relationship and overall,  I think both sides are very happy with the way the relationship is developing. Australia and  India have increasingly had common goals, we have more and more in common in terms of  our national objectives today, we have more in common in terms of our national objectives  we have had for many years. First of all, the growth of the Indian economy has been  substantial and sustained and I think the outlook to the Indian economy is very promising and  Australian businesses are very enthusiastic about participating in the Indian market; they are  investing in India; they are exporting to India; they are importing from India. Australia, in the  medium to long term is going to be a very important source of supply for India’s energy and  resource needs and we are very happy to play that role and to work with India in those areas.  India is also sending more and more students to Australia. Australia is now the second largest  foreign destination for Indian students, the largest being the United States. Australia has now  overtaken the United Kingdom, according to the Indian Secretary of Education. I am not sure  of all the figures myself but I think it is looking pretty promising and we would like to see  more Indian students coming to Australia and taking advantage of the opportunities that our  universities and other institutes of higher education have to offer to India.    

 The third thing is that India has a ‘Look East’ policy. India is becoming more engaged in the  affairs of East Asia and we are very pleased to see that. We participate with India in the  ASEAN regional forum and the ASEAN post- ministerial conference once a year. We are  talking with India and other countries in East Asia about India and Australia’s participation in  the East Asia summit that isn’t concluded yet but we are still working on that, and that is  potentially an area again where Indian and Australian interests will coincide. Over and above  that, I think Australia and India, which have a long historic relationship, can build on some of  the history of our relationship. Now what are some of the components of our relationship is  that our two countries love cricket and the Foreign Minister and I both love cricket. So, we  spent a good deal of time over the lunch talking about our respective cricket teams and their  prospects. We think that what we should do between us, between Australia and India, is to

 have a touring exhibition of Sir Donald Bradman-Sir Donald Bradman’s memorabilia here in  India. And we think that this exhibition, which should be jointly supported by Australia and  India, would be very popular and this exhibition of Bradman memorabilia would go to major  centres in India- New Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, Chennai and so on. I think it will be very well  received by the Indian people and what’s more, it reinforces one of the very strong bonds that  exist between Australia and India. I am very happy to answer any questions that you might  have, about any issues you want.   

 

 Journalist- Mr Minister, do you play cricket?   

 Downer- I did. I played cricket very enthusiastically. I used to bowl. I was a medium pace  bowler.   

 Journalist: (inaudible) allegations about China operating a spy ring in Australia, my question  is will the two defectors be granted asylum in Australia.  And what impact will their  allegations and their claims for asylum have on Australia’s relations with China?   

 Downer:  Well first of all I don’t think that they should have any impact on Australia’s  relations with China -it’s a very substantial relationship, we have good relations with China.  Any claims for asylum in Australia are treated consistently with our obligations under the  1951 Refugee Convention. And these applications will be considered in the light of those  obligations that we have under the 1951 Refugee Convention. There will be, a determination  will be made by an officer or officers at the Department of Immigration - the Government  itself doesn’t make those determinations. And we’ll, you know we’ll just take things as they  come.   

 Journalist: (inaudible)   

 Downer: No I don’t think it’s going to have a significant impact on Australia - China  relations. I really don’t. It is a relationship which is broad and a deep relationship. We have  very substantial political relations now with modern China, we have a strong economic  relationship. We have common interests in seeing a secure and stable East Asia. When one or  two people apply for asylum, you know, regardless of the outcome of the process of  considering those applications I don’t think it’s going to have a big impact one way or  another. And I’m confident about that.   

 Journalist: Mr Downer Geoff Thomson from ABC, sorry to get you here but obviously there  are some questions that some people want some answers to in Australia. You said yesterday  that there was no formal application for asylum from Mr Chen -I’ve got a letter here that is in  circulation in Australia in which he has applied for political asylum on the 25th of May. What  (inaudible) if so why and what constitutes a formal or informal application or rejection?   

 Downer: Well look, there are two things to say about this. First of all I don’t think we should  get bogged down in the semantics here. I mean it’s clear that Mr Chen applied on the, I think  the 27th of May to stay in Australia. He didn’t make a formal application to me for political  asylum. He made and that letter illustrates an application to the Department of Immigration.  And if you read the whole of the letter you would see that in that letter he asks the Department 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 2

 

 of Immigration if it would be prepared to vary his visa. Look this is a quite a semantic point  because he certainly applied to stay in Australia and the only semantic and minor point that I  would make is that he didn’t make a direct application to me as the Foreign Minister for  political asylum, that’s the only point I am making. But he certainly made an application to  stay in Australia. As time went on it became clear to us that the best way for him to apply  would be through an application for a protection visa, so that the case that he wanted to put  could be objectively considered. It doesn’t make - and I’ve made this point before - it doesn’t  make as much sense for people to just apply for political asylum and expect the Foreign  Minister to just make a decision with a stroke of a pen. It’s much wiser to have a considered  process which can be worked through by the Immigration Department, they’re the experts in  considering these cases. If you (inaudible) asylum in Australia you have to put a case that if  you were returned to your home you would suffer persecution because of your political or  religious or philosophical views- that’s all articulated there in the 1951 Refugee Convention.  And it certainly seemed to us that that was the best way for it to be handled rather than there  to be a formal application to the Foreign Minister, for simply the Foreign Minister to make a  decision. Well obviously under those circumstances the Foreign Minister would be expected  to consult his colleagues. But nevertheless it seemed to me and it seems to the government to  just make a lot more sense in terms of handling due process. I don’t think he is in anyway  disadvantaged by this, I think on the contrary I think this is a good process, it’s a fair way of  doing it and I think all Australians would expect us to handle this application in an open and a  fair way.   

 Journalist: But this new application is a resubmission of the original application for political  asylum (inaudible) does that mean that (inaudible) that political asylum is rejected or not?   

 Downer: Well we have clearly discouraged that application for political asylum on the  grounds that an application for a permanent protection visa is the much more appropriate way  to go because an application for political asylum as such - in other words for some sort of  territorial protection as it is sometimes called or a territorial visa, it’s only been granted twice  that I’m aware of in Australian history - is done by administrative fiat. I think it would be,  I  personally think it would be much more appropriate for the Immigration Department to make  the appropriate judgements about the merits of the case, rather than for the Minister to make  an administrative decision without reference to the facts. So I think the Immigration   Department will handle this well and effectively and I do quite openly say that I think that is t  he best way to go. So no matter how the applications are made and formal and informal  applications and requests, I’ve personally been of the view that the way we’re handling it the  best way to handle it.    

 Journalist: Along with Chen Yonglin we now have another application for some sort of  asylum for Hao Fengjun, so there is two Chinese people in Australia seeking asylum - this is  building it seems, he backs the claims of widespread spying, is this proving to be  embarrassing for Australia in its relationship with China?   

 Downer: This is the difference here and I’m criticising the media here by the way, (inaudible)  there is no argument on that. If I was in the media I would be running it but let me just point  out that w get something like 3000 applications a year for protection, I think for protection  visas of one kind or another. And you know occasionally they succeed and often they don’t  but we get an enormous number of applications and it’s true some of those applications come 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 3

 

 from China. And it’s always (inaudible) for a long time being that, probably not always but  certainly for a very long time been that. And so all of these applications whether they are from  China or from wherever they may be from, anywhere else, they’re all just considered on their  merits and if they is meritorious case to be put then we respond positively to that case. I don’t  think this is a cause for any controversy, I don’t think either of these people need to think that  we will, (inaudible) make this point - let me make this point quite strongly - I don’t want  either of these people to think that we would handle these applications unfairly. We will look  at the applications on the basis of their merits and the Department of Immigration will make a  determination. Obviously if the applicants don’t like the determination and it’s a negative  determination they can then appeal to the refugee review tribunal. That’s part of the due  process we have and I don’t want to see this handled in an unfair way but I don’t see any  particular cause for controversial and any rational for controversy.   

 Journalist: Just to be absolutely clear, does the discouragement of political asylum mean  rejection of political asylum?   

 Downer: Well I’m just making the point that when you consider through the options of the  best way to handle this I repeat what I’ve said. I think, obviously people can make formal  applications for political asylum, it’s never happened in my time as the Foreign Minister and  this particular case the original letter which Bob Brown has released a part of but not all of  was a letter not addressed to me it was addressed to the Immigration Department. I know that  the applicant used the expression “political asylum”, that he asked the Department of  Immigration to vary his visa. And you know clearly in these circumstances the Government  has to reflect on how best to handle these kind of issues and I think you know in the time I’m  the Foreign Minister I stick pretty solidly with my view that it’s much more appropriate for  the Department of Immigration with al its experience to make the appropriate determination  on the basis of the facts presented to it rather than Foreign Ministers making impulsive  decisions just on the basis of representation from one of an argument. I mean I think we have  to look at all sides of the argument.   

 Journalist: Is the question of political asylum still open though?   

 Downer: Well the application is now been made for a - you know I don’t want to get into the  semantics of formal and informal applications -  but clearly a quite formal application has  been made for a protection visa and we’ll see how that goes.   

 Journalist: (inaudible)   

 Downer: We don’t speak about intelligence matters that is a standard procedure of the  Australian Government.    

 Journalist: During your discussion with the Indian side, did you cover any ground on your  concern for regional and mutual security, particularly international terrorism?   

 Downer: Yes, we did discuss that. You know, Australia and India have a memorandum of  understanding on counter terrorism, I think its well known that we talk to each other at some  length including and most substantially the officials level about counter-terrorism and India  has a lot of experience in this area, a lot of knowledge of terrorism and we have of course our

 own rather sad experiences and our own knowledge and I think we are all united together in  our determination to defeat terrorism and moreover I think as time goes on and bit by bit, in  spite of there being problems and there have been some explosions in Jakarta during the  course of today. But in spite of all of that, we are making progress in the struggle against  terrorism. I think the fact that not just the United States, its countries like India and Australia  which are examples of countries working together in the struggle to counter terrorism and we  are making progress.   

 Journalist- Have you also discussed the issue of United Nations reforms with Mr Natwar  Singh and what is your stand on India’s desire for a permanent membership in the Security  Council?   

 Downer- Well, not surprisingly, the Indian Minister for External Affairs  raised with me with  some enthusiasm the issue of the G4 proposal for permanent members of the Security  Council. We support in addition to the five permanent members of the Security Council and  one of the countries that we would like to see as a permanent member of the Security Council  is India. I think, we all know, it is not just that I think, we all know that the permanent  members of the Security Council at the moment are the countries which were the major  winners in the Second World War though we should not diminish the contributions that  Indians and Australians made by the way in the Second World War- just want to make that  point. But let me say the world is a very different place from the world at the San Francisco  conference in 1945, and this is a world where there are countries like India with a billion  people, with significant economies, with high rates of growth, which have a big statement to  make to the world. I don’t think its appropriate for India to be excluded from permanent  membership of the Security Council. So, any other country, I quite specifically mention two  other countries that I think should be permanent members of the Security Council. One of  them is Japan, it’s the world’s second biggest economy and is a very big aid donor around the  world. In all parts of the developing world, you see a Japanese presence in terms of aid,  donation, it is a strong supporter of the United Nations in a number of different ways and I  would like to see Japan as a permanent member of the Security Council and on the basis of  the size of a country, and its population and its reach, I think that Brazil should be a  permanent member of the Security Council as well. There are other claims and I am not  necessarily against them, but I mention those three particularly.   

 Journalist- On the issue of United Nations reforms, what is your sense whether the reform will  actually take place because obviously, there is a G4 framework resolution and different  countries have different views about it. In your assessment at the end of September or early  October, would we actually have an expansion of the Security Council? How do you look at  that?   

 Downer - I think there is a reasonable chance, there will be an expansion of the Security  Council. I won’t go into the details here. I will leave that to the Indian Government to talk  about and the Japanese and the Germans and the Brazilians but I think there is some finessing  that is needed of the G 4 framework resolution. But if it is appropriately handled,  appropriately finessed, I think that there is every chance that the resolution will get the  requisite, I think its two thirds majority that’s needed in the General Assembly and that it  won’t be vetoed in the Security Council. I think there is a good chance of that and so my  advice to the Indian Government is that this is not the time to give up, this is the time to keep 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 5

 

 working through the issues, look at some of the concerns some countries have but might  otherwise be very supportive of the resolution and they might get quite substantial support,  including the appropriate two thirds majority in the General Assembly. I think it is possible.    

 Question- You referred to the East Asia Summit, what exactly did you discuss with Natwar  Singh and what do you think are the problems, if any, in India and Australia participating in  that summit meeting?   

 Downer - Well, I don’t think there are, in relation to India, I mean. India can speak for itself  as it always does. But I don’t think there are problems with Indian participation in the East  Asian Summit and we would like to see that in relation to Australia. There is a question of 

 Australia adhering to the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and we have been having  very productive discussions with ASEAN governments over the last few weeks about that. I  am not going to make any announcement about it here today but ASEAN have laid down  three pre-conditions for participation in the East Asian summit, and I think India meets all  three and Australia certainly meets two of them, and if we were to accede to work to indicate  our commitment to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, my guess is that Australia  would participate in the summit as well. That will be a process that both India and Australia  would jointly participate in.   

 Journalist- Could you please spell out the details of the strategic dialogue you had and you are  having and the kind of ramifications of this strategic dialogue with today’s meetings. Does it  also entail some sort of joint patrolling of oceans and sea links-strategic sea links- in the  Australian joint patrolling?   

 Downer - We don’t do joint patrolling but one of the points that I have made while I have  been here is when we have a strategic dialogue with India, every year, at senior officials  levels and that is an opportunity for our two sides to talk through the geo-political  environment of the Asia-Pacific region and of the Indian Ocean and to understand each others  perspectives. I would like to see the development of further cooperation between the Indian  and Australian defence forces. I think there is good scope to build on that cooperation. We are  both Indian Ocean countries. Some of the more sensitive trade routes through the region, for  example, the Straits of Malacca. (Inaudible) In any case, we have to remember that when it  comes to providing protection for some of these sensitive passages through the Asia-Pacific  region, particularly in South East Asia. The preference is for littoral states to have the primary  responsibility for protection and security and that there is no doubt other countries like  Australia and India can provide additional assistance if it is requested. We had a good  opportunity to talk about those issues today but also during the recent strategic dialogue in  Canberra.   

 Journalist- Is Australia pursuing a Free Trade Agreement with India? If not, why at Sydney  talks last month, did it stop short of pursuing an FTA?   

 Downer- I am not sure that India is quite ready to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade  Agreement with Australia. We nevertheless made an agreement to develop a trade and  economic agreement. I think that will hope to facilitate trade further between Australia and  India, and who knows where in time that will lead to. I mean it is perfectly possible that at  some time in the future, we will end up with a Free Trade Agreement. I mean I am not sure

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 7

 this will happen but it could- that we could one day have a free trade area which would go  from the north of China, cover much of the Indian subcontinent, include South East Asia and  Australia and New Zealand, and I think that would be a long way from now and that is a very  ambitious vision. But I think that is a good vision to bear in mind when you think about the  economic interactions around the region and the potential for the region to build those  economic relationships.
