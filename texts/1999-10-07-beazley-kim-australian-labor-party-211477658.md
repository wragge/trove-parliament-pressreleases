  ADDRESS TO THE CEPU DIVISIONAL CONFERENCE

  

  THURSDAY 7 OCTOBER 1999

  MELBOURNE

  

  Thanks very much for the invitation to address you today. We have 
much to discuss, both on industrial relations and the future of two 
of Australia’s  most precious national assets — Telstra and 
Australia Post.

  

 Before I get to those issues, however, let me first 
talk to you about another issue which concerns us all as Australians, 
and that is the current state of play over East Timor, and the implications 
for Australian politics more generally.

  

 At the outset, let me congratulate the CEPU for its 
role in applying pressure at critical moments towards securing Australian 
and international commitment for a force that could stabilise East Timor, 
protect the lives of those remaining there, and create the conditions 
for a successful outcome.

  

 ln doing so, you helped to fill a hole in this government’s 
diplomatic efforts, which were denying the requirement for such a force.

  

 A lot has been said this week about Labor’s commitment 
to the force in East Timor —much of it false — so let me reiterate:

  

 Labor supports our deployment in East Timor. We support 
it for as long as it takes to get the job done, whether that be under 
the rubric of an intervention force, or as a blue helmet peacekeeping 
operation when the UN judges the situation sufficiently peaceful to 
do so.

  

 We are not yet at that stage, as is obvious from the 
combat last night.

  

 Let me say how relieved I am that the wounds of the 
two soldiers are not life-threatening.

  

 I am sure we are all impressed at the professionalism 
of the force and its commander, and that we all wish our injured soldiers 
a speedy recovery.

  

 I join with the Prime Minister and General Cosgrove 
in urging the militias to come to their senses. They have nothing to 
gain by disrupting a UN-sanctioned operation. It is time they laid down 
their arms, and allowed peace to come to East Timor.

  

 This incident underlines the enormous danger of this 
mission and the importance that our troops understand they have our 
full support.

  

 We have a difficult task in Opposition. That task 
is to support our troops, while at the same time holding the government 
accountable for its errors. Unless governments are carefully scrutinised 
like this in a democracy, more mistakes are made.

  

 In particular, we need to ensure the right diplomatic 
environment for this commitment, both now, and for when it comes under 
a more formal UN peacekeeping structure.

  

 Our concerns with the government’s errors in relation 
to the so-called Howard Doctrine, and the ill-timed discussion of hot 
pursuit are specifically focused on the need to ensure that the international 
community understands that we serve not Australia’s interests, but 
universal ones.

  

 I am more optimistic now that we will get the right 
decision on East Timor’s independence from the Indonesian Parliament. 
I note too the Indonesian military saying it will not encourage the 
militias. Based on experience, however, I suggest suspension of judgment 
until we see the reality on the ground.

  

 Similarly, I would say the same for promises of the 
safe return of refugees from across the border with West Timor.

  

 There will be a continuing task before the Australian 
government to convince the region of the need for an ongoing commitment 
to East Timor when this issue has departed the urgent agenda of the 
international community.

  

  That’s why it is a pity John Howard is not in the South Pacific 
this week, briefing regional leaders on the complexity of the situation 
and securing their support.  That would provide us with a useful 
ballast for the long haul.

  

 This issue is linked to another, and that is our response 
to the budgetary impact of the new spending requirements arising from 
the deployment.

  

 Suffice to say, we believe it should be adequately 
funded, and we are prepared to support such expenditures as are necessary.

  

 But we should make no mistake that even the lesser 
commitment of the blue helmet phase of this operation will still be 
a substantial impost on the Australian Budget.

  

 This throws into relief immediately the issue of the 
government’s business tax package.

  

  A few weeks ago, Peter Costello argued that the increased defence 
spending required by our Timor commitment should be funded by spending 
cuts.

  

  As I said earlier, the Opposition has supported the government throughout 
on all that the Timor mission require s, and indicated our provisional 
support for higher defence spending down the track.

  

 But we offer that support on the basis that everyone 
contributes equally to bearing the burdens.

  

 This is why we were so concerned and angry when we 
discovered last week that John Howard had pulled a speech by Jocelyn 
Newman outlining radical new cuts to social welfare.

  

 Everyone knows what was in that speech. All the work 
had been done, and the Minister had even carefully leaked some of it 
beforehand — cuts in aged pensions; disability pensions; single parent 
benefits and the like.

  

 These plans have not gone away, they have just been 
locked in the bottom drawer. Make no mistake — this is the Howard 
Government’s secret agenda on welfare. It will re-emerge from the 
bottom drawer — the question is when.

 But what really brings this into context is Peter 
Costello’s cheerful admission last week that there is at least a $2 
billion hole in his business tax package, which most others looking 
at his figuring put at $4 billion.

  

 We raised this issue directly with him in the Parliament. 
His response was to say that the projected Budget surpluses mean any 
shortfall can be funded.

  

 You heard me right — the surplus isn’t there for 
ordinary Australians and their families; or for the disadvantaged. It’s 
not even there for our troops in Timor.

  

 But it is there for a $4 billion tax cut for big business.

  

 I said on Monday, and I repeat it here today: the 
government began this business tax process promising that the reforms 
would pay for themselves. It did this for a reason — namely, the unfairness 
of monstering Australian families with a 10% GST, while preparing an 
enormous free ride for big business. We intend to hold the government 
to its original promise.

  

 This business tax package was always meant to pay 
for itself, and if it doesn’t, the Labor Party can’t support it.

  

 But what is now becoming clear to Australians is that 
this is a government for the few, not the many.

  

 It presides over prosperous economic times built on 
the sacrifices of the Australian people over the past decade and a half.

  

 But those who went through the pain won’t share 
equally in the gain.

  

 Now that the economy is performing better, the benefits 
are flowing overwhelmingly to a privileged few.

  

 Which is a good point at which to cross over to deal 
with some issues of direct concern to CEPU members, and that is policy 
towards Australia Post and Telstra.

  

 The recent publication of Telstra’s poor service 
record — especially in rural and regional areas — confirmed almost 
to the letter what you — and we — have been saying ever since this 
government began selling Telstra in 1996. We said that privatisation 
would seriously compromise service levels — and especially for rural 
and regional Australia.

  

  This has happened at a time when e veryone in regional Australia 
knows that Telstra holds one of the keys to their future prosperity.

  

 Communications access in the bush these days is what 
roads and bridges used to be in terms of critical infrastructure underpinning 
vibrant regions.

  

 This is why we opposed the sale of Telstra in the 
first place, and why we continue to do so.

  

 It is also why we oppose any privatisation of Australia 
Post.

  

 We believe that the privatisation of infrastructure 
of this nature can only lead to an increased focus on profitable areas, 
with a corresponding decline of services in marginal areas, such as 
remote and rural Australia.

  

 We recognise that Australia Post is a critical part 
of Australia’s communications infrastructure, and plays a unique role 
in ensuring that Australians everywhere have access to a quality, reliable 
postal service.

  

 You will recall the campaign we waged together before 
the last federal election. You will also recall our election commitments. 
We pledged to:

  

  ·  Retain Australia Post in full public ownership;

  

  ·  Scrap further deregulation of Australia Post’s reserved 
services; and

  ·  Maintain existing cross subsidies between metropolitan and 
regional Australia to guarantee an equitable flat rate for the standard 
letter.

  

  We also pledged that if we formed governm ent, we would examine 
ways in which Australia Post could be used to provide equitable access 
to a full range of financial services — including banking and bill 
paying services — as part of our regional banking initiatives. We 
note that the government has not picked this issue up in its rural transaction 
centres.

  

 I was proud to campaign with you then, and let me 
tell you that if the government brings forward legislation for the further 
deregulation of Australia Post, we will honour these election commitments 
in full.

  

 Labor will oppose any deregulatory changes that would 
reduce the capacity for Australia Post to provide services, and will 
ensure that Australia Post is able to carry on its unique role in the 
emerging digital age.

  

 In the time remaining today, I want to talk to you 
about another area of great concern to the ALP — and the labour movement 
more broadly - and that is industrial relations.

  

 Let this government be in no doubt about our views 
on this: I see industrial relations as an issue on which we will fight 
the next federal election campaign.

  

 This government constantly assaults workers, the independent 
umpire, the union movement, the award system, and the capacity to bargain 
collectively.

  

 For 90 years and more, Australians have come to expect 
that in industrial relations governments are there to keep the peace, 
hold the ring, and ensure fair play: to make sure that no one interest 
could control the workplace and working conditions.

  

 With one exception, governments of all persuasions 
have accepted this responsibility. The exception was the Government 
of Stanley Melbourne Bruce, whose one claim on our attention today is 
that, when he tried to evade this responsibility, he and his government 
perished in a landslide 70 years ago almost to the day — the 22nd 
of October 1929.

  

 Industrial relations was one issue about which Australians 
never needed to feel uncomfortable, or insecure, or threatened.

  

 Not any more.

  

 We now have a government which shows that, after 13 
years in the wilderness, there are bones to be picked. And the biggest 
bone of all is industrial relations.

  

 To begin with, there was the first wave.

  

 John Howard sought support in the 1996 election with 
the so-called core promise that, under his IR legislation, no worker 
would be worse off.

  

  Th at promise was quickly swept away in the first wave of 1996.

  

 The MUA dispute then showed that this is a law under 
which:

  

  ·  armed and masked men with attack dogs could drive workers 
from their workplace; and

  ·  employers 
could shift labour to shelf companies so that they could avoid their 
legal and moral responsibilities.

  

  The government not only encouraged this, its Ministers (Peter Reith 
foremost among them) actively connived in it.

  

  The government’s first wave of attacks meant that:

  

  ·  The award safety net has been eroded, particularly as it 
defended the interests and living standards of people in part-time and 
casual work;

  ·  Workers’ 
influence over health and safety in the workplace has been compromised;

  ·  It 
has become much more difficult to balance work and family responsibilities; 
and

  

  ·  The Commission’s powers to settle disputes have virtually 
been abolished, resulting in disputes (such as the waterfront, and in 
the Hunter Valley) which have threatened serious damage to the national 
economy.

  Before th e ink was dry on his first wave, Peter Reith was drawing 
up his   2 nd wave legislation. This is the legislation which 
is now before the Senate.

  

  This is the legislation Peter Reith calls “More Jobs, Better Pay”.

  

  You know, the best character analysis of Pete r Reith I have 
ever read was actually written about 50 years ago, by a gentleman named 
George Orwell, in the famous novel “Animal Farm”.

  

 He introduces one of the farmyard animals as follows:

  

 “The best known among them was a pig named Squealer, 
with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill 
voice. He was a brilliant talker and, when he was arguing some difficult 
point, he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail 
which was somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that 
he could turn black into white.”

  

  If calling this legislation “More Jobs, Better Pay” isn’t turning 
black into white, I don’t know what is.

  

  We all know by now that you don’t listen to what Peter Reith says: 
you watch very carefully what he does (or tries to do).

  

  There are two basic thin gs he is trying to do in his 2nd wave 
legislation.

  

 One is to stacks the odds even more against the individual 
worker. Here are some examples of what his legislation seeks to do:

  ·  Change the object of awards from “fair and reasonable” 
conditions to “basic minimum” conditions;

  ·  Make 
workers negotiate directly with employers on basic conditions such as 
long service leave, training and accident make-up pay;

  ·  Abolish 
the cooling-off period before employers can sue workers at common law, 
making it easier for employers to take workers to court; and

  ·  If 
they want their union rep to come to the workplace, to make workers 
write and ask, putting their names to their invitation.

  

  The second of Peter Reith’s basic objectives is to neutralise the 
institutions which h elp protect the interests and safety of working 
people: the Commission — the workplace umpire — and the unions. 
The legislation proposes, for example, that:

  

  ·  All members of the Commission (except the President) will 
be appointed for limited periods;

  ·  Members 
can be “acting” for one year, so that the government can see if 
they meet its standards;

  ·  The 
Commission and the courts must grant orders and injunctions against 
industrial action, even without hearings;

  ·  Federal Courts will not be allowed 
to vary unfair labour contracts; and

  ·  Right of entry provisions will make it extremely difficult 
for unions to recruit and organise in workplace.

  

  These are just some examples of how biased, divisive and unfair Peter 
Reith’s   2 nd wave is. It has created outrage and 
concern in the wider community, not just among the usual industrial 
relations practitioners.

  

 This is shown in the diversity of the submissions 
— nearly 500 of them - which have been put to the Senate committee 
now studying the legislation.

  

 This concern is not confined to individual working 
people and community organisations. Employer groups, though they may 
like the propositions in general, are uneasy about aspects of them, 
as we can see from the submissions to the Senate committee:

  

  ·  The Australian Industry Group is worried about the proposal 
for fixed terms for Commissioners;

  ·  The Motor Traders’ Association of 
NSW about further award simplification;

  ·  The National Electrical and Communications Association about 
the secret ballot proposals; and

  ·  Even 
the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry — and, remember, the 
2nd wave is largely an ACCI creation — has concerns about the proposals 
covering rights of entry.

  

  The balance of fairness that the system used to maintain between employer 
and employee  has gone.

  

 The Commission and unions which helped see fair play 
in the workplace have been limited by the law from doing so.

  

 Workplace bargaining has become stressful, exhausting 
and worrying for working people. The award system which protected working 
conditions in such areas as part-time employment, maternity leave and 
health and safety has been skinned down to the bare bones.

  

 And be absolutely sure about this: Peter Reith’s 
3rd wave is already on the drawing board in his department. Some of 
the elements can be seen in his 101 ideas for what he calls “continuing 
reform.. .aimed at increasing labour market flexibility” all laid 
out before John Howard in that famous letter marked “Cabinet-in-Confidence”.

  

 The reason it was in confidence is that Peter Reith 
obviously thought that they weren’t the sort of ideas that working 
people should see: award protection cut to an absolute minimum; even 
less power and an even smaller role for the Commission; the list goes 
on.

  

 The 101 ideas letter raises an important point about 
Peter Reith and this government: they do one thing while saying another.

  

 This is a government the wise person will not trust. 
This is a government whose word will not necessarily be its bond.

  

 In conclusion, Labor absolutely rejects this second 
wave legislation. We will be moving our amendments, but basically we 
oppose the second wave.

  

  We will have our alternative, revolving around a strong umpire; strong 
rights to bargain collectively; right of entry for unions to workplaces 
to assist that; and protecting the rights of people to join unions if 
that is their desire. We will move amendme nts around that.

  

 But we will also go further, and this is really what 
my remarks today have been targeted at. We want to restore the balance 
in Australian family life.

  

 This government only ever spends its time thinking 
about how to make family life harder, and that goes to its GST agenda; 
its secret welfare agenda; and especially its industrial relations agenda.

  

 Industrial relations will be one of the areas where 
we will start to reclaim Australian family life — for example, by 
giving a stronger IRC a mandate to promote family-friendly work practices 
throughout Australian workplaces.

  

 We will have more to say about this in the coming 
months, and in the lead-up to the next election.

  

 But for us it all ties into the bottom line, which 
is fairness: fairness for Australian families; for Australian workers; 
for Australian kids — fairness for all Australians.

  

 Governments used to care about fairness. It’s time 
they did again. Thank you.
