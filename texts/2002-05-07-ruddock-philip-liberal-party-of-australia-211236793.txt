 Migration intake

 Doorstop interview, 7 May

 Philip Ruddock: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for coming in here this morning. I apologise if I had you racing back from the address I just gave. I think there is some material that's being handed out to you this morning, some of it was prepared for the conference that I've just addressed.

 I took the opportunity during the speech I gave to announce the humanitarian and non-humanitarian programs for this year.

 And speaking of the humanitarian program first, the principle point that I would make is that in reiterating that we are able to continue a resettlement program which, together with onshore arrivals found to be refugees, will be for 12,000 people in the year 2002-03, I've also been able to make it clear that the refugee load will include those that the UNHCR asks us to take.

 That will include any accepted refugees the UNHCR has processed or have been processed at Manus or Nauru or Indonesia.

 We do expect with the very substantial decrease foreshadowed in onshore arrivals in numbers that will have to be accommodated next year, that we'll be able to restore in large measure the special humanitarian program to 6,000 places and that is for people who are judged to be suffering significant human rights abuse and have relatives in Australia.

 The point I've made is that the refugee and humanitarian program is unique because we are one of the nine countries that does resettle people. Switzerland was a country that resettled people for many years, gave it away after onshore arrivals reached numbers that simply limited their capacity and one of the aspects of the way in which we've been handling onshore arrivals has been to maintain our ability to help those who are in greatest need.

 I was in Pakistan on Wednesday and was at Peshawar. From Peshawar some 327,000 people have either returned home or are in the course of returning home because they're able to go back in circumstances which they freely judge, because they're going back voluntarily, to be safe and secure. And they do so with assistance provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 Four-hundred-thousand people, if you include those that have gone back from Quetta in Baluchistan, Kajikistan and Iran have gone back and something like 800,000 people will return during the course of this calendar year, probably by about August- September when the onset of the European autumn and winter emerges and slows it down. And there will probably be another million or so during the course of next year.

 The UNHCR says to me amongst the population of three million that we are dealing with we will still

 have to find resettlement places out of the Islamabad office for 2,500 people. Now, who are those 2,500 people? Inevitably those 2,500 people are women at risk, people who may be of a particular ethnic minority that cannot be returned. But the bulk of people who are Afghan, 400,000 have gone back already voluntarily, and the UNHCR are making arrangements for another 400,000.

 The numbers of people who are in urgent need of resettlement are relatively small but always there is a demand for places like that. And we were able to assure them that of that 2,500 people that Australia would be able to take 600, so we're going to take more than 20% of the total number of people from that particular mission during the course of this year.

 Now, the non-humanitarian program, I've announced today that we've set a planning level of 100,000 to 110,000 places. It's 105,000 places plus or minus five and that has been set. It will enable us to grow the skilled program as well as the family reunion program. If you assume that it's 105,000, if you look at 93 which was the projected outcome, and we make that very clear, the project outcome, it's a 12,000 place increase. But you will recall that last year we announced a program that had a contingency reserve so the contingency reserve was eight, I think, that took it from 85 to 93.

 So you can see that this a very substantial increase, it's one in which the skill stream will have 60,700 places and the family program will have, as I recall, 43,200 places. Both of them are increases. We've kept a contingency reserve for parents in the prospect that we may get agreement from the Opposition. The Government will not be in any way compromising on its requirement that that contingency reserve will only be utilised if there is a fair contribution by sponsors to those who are being sponsored in addition to the taxpayer sponsorship, which is considerable.

 The program has been announced as essentially a four year program and it builds upon the changes that we have effected over time. The papers that have been distributed today as attachments are very important because they deal with a number of issues which were important for determining the program outcome.

 The projections that you can see for the net overseas migration reveal that it's going to continue over time as a fairly static figure, even with this increase in migration. The statistics that deal with the brain gain, by having an emphasis on skilled migration, are very important. The extent to which Australian migrants today are doing better because they are more employable, you can see, looking at the red cohort as against the green cohort, that the employed numbers have gone up and the unemployment numbers have dropped very considerably. The number that are owning their own business, numbers that have spoken English and so on have all increased, the numbers with university degrees have increased.

 Can I just make sure I got that right? It's the red cohort was those who arrived between September 1993 and August 1995 and the green cohort are those that arrived between September 1999 and August 2000, so you've got a difference there between those who have entered under the new arrangements and those who have entered under the old.

 You've got also the tables dealing with improved living standards, what's happening in relation to fertility levels, what's happened in relation to the government budget and what you can see there is particularly the role of skilled migration in improving budget outcomes and the like.

 So there are a number of tables there that indicate that we are doing better than most other countries and the various categories in which we're doing it and a number of those comparisons are international comparisons.

 Also we have in announcing the table today included some material that deals with the economic aspects of migration in detail and there is a table that also outlines the reasons why we don't adopt population targets, but we do have a policy approach taking into account population issues and they are set out in detail and finally we have some papers dealing with skilled migration into Australia's regions, the initiatives that we've been taking in relation to those matters, and there is a paper today which deals with the enhancement of the state-specific and regional migration initiatives which I hope you will find particularly helpful.

 The point I would make is that we've reached almost 4,000 places that have been redistributed as a result of government initiatives and those places, I hope, can continue to grow under the new mechanisms that I've announced today including the increase in the pass marks for skilled migration. The increase in the pass mark means that utilising the skilled database and our capacity to influence decisions of people it is enhanced.

 By raising the pass mark for general migration it means you've got the capacity to still get people with high levels of skill who will take the opportunity to settle in regional Australia because for them a lower point of entry is required, particularly if they've obtained their qualifications in Australia.

 Having said all that I think you may have heard my speech or if you didn't there's a copy of it in the folder that's there for you. Do you have any questions?

 Question: Can you confirm the overall numbers will be 122,000 or is the 110,000 projected inclusive of the 10,000 humanitarian?

 Philip Ruddock: No, what I can tell you is that the number that has been set is a planning target of 105,000 in the non-humanitarian program, plus or minus 5,000. So you can say that if we're unable to reach it it could be slightly lower. We've left that flexibility and we've said that if we're able to get more people with the appropriate skills it can rise to 110. Now, if you want to add to the maximum, assuming you get the maximum, there is a potential for 122,000.

 Question: All right, so coming back to the figures of the humanitarian places, if we've got 4,000 offshore, does that cover anyone who might make an application from Nauru or from PNG or from Indonesia? Is that enough to cover your back?

 Philip Ruddock: Yes. Look, the numbers of people that are being resettled under UNHCR auspices, at the moment I think we've had 317, if I remember the figure correctly, accepted out of 400. There will be some further announcements during the course of this week, the course of next week May 13. I suspect that there will be a case of diminishing returns. I don't expect that everyone's going to get an asylum place.

 Question: So 4,000 is enough to cover the Pacific Solution?

 Philip Ruddock: The Pacific numbers that are being processed are 1,500 and what we do have, and it's important that you report this, what we do have is New Zealand has indicated that it's taking 56 immediately from Nauru and those numbers include, I think 40 Iraqis and 16, or maybe it's 59, there's 14 and five, so it's 19, it's 59.

 Question: Can I come back to clarify something else, so the 2,000 onshore then, how many do you expect of the places to be taken up by people in detention centres who might get a visa application accepted as refugees? What are your projected figures for that?

 Philip Ruddock: Detention figures are not closely looked at and I'd like people to focus on them for a moment and if you'd like a copy of the tables we'll give it to you. At the moment there are 1,270 people in detention. Of those, I think the figure that I last saw was 927 are available for removal. So you have around about - if people are available for removal they're not getting refugee places. So the potential is for - assuming the courts intervened in every case and what we're dealing with are rejectees who are before the courts or before the Refugee Review Tribunal - assuming every one was given a place it would be 350. I mean it's not going to use all of the contingencies.

 What's behind the assumptions here is that very few of those now in detention will be released on temporary protection visas but there will still inevitably be a pool of people who are overstayed visitors, people who turn up on aircraft who make asylum claims. It's somewhere around about 1,200 or so that seem to get up under those figures at the moment and there's a bit of slack in case we get other boat arrivals that we may have to handle.

 But we've now gone six months. I don't know whether it was anybody in this room who was saying

 "Minister, what about the cyclones, what's going to happen at the end of the cyclone season?" I just remember, I've had so many of these meetings since January where people have said to me, "What about the end of the cyclone season, what's going to happen?" Well, I don't know when the cyclone season finished but the fact is that since November, since November there have been no unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia.

 Question: Can I just ask you, given that the 4,000 places for offshore refugees will be taken from Nauru, Manus and Indonesia, what do- -Philip Ruddock: No, they won't, no they won't. They will be taken globally and the bulk of them will come from Africa and the Middle East.

 Question: So what proportion do you think- -Philip Ruddock: I suspect that there will be very few, but we have left scope so that if the places are not taken in other resettlement programs they'll be taken in ours. What these figures essentially - I wouldn't focus too much on it - what they essentially mean is, to the UNHCR, is that the resettlement pool of places is the same.

 There is not a pool of people who intended to get to Australia that will be forced on Australia and will not come from the general resettlement pool internationally. What it means is that there'll be burden sharing. What it means is, if people are resettled in New Zealand, or if they're resettled in Sweden, or in Norway, or in the United States of America, or any of the other places where the UNHCR is seeking resettlement places, then that maximises the number of places that the UNHCR has from us.

 Question: So don't you think our ability to take people from further up the chain, if you like, is being impeded by basically quarantining that 4,000?

 Philip Ruddock: No, what it's saying is very simply is that this pool of people found to be refugees by the UNHCR are judged to be as urgently requiring a place as somebody in Africa and somebody in the Middle East. That's what it's saying and it's saying to the UNHCR you still have exactly the same number of places, it's just a question - you've made these decisions, it's just a question of where you want to put them.

 Question: - -further up the- -Philip Ruddock: Well, I do agree with that and that's why I argue that the UNHCR ought to be working with us, as they are, to get resettlement places in countries to which these people did not expect to go. That's the very view, that's the very reason for us pushing very strongly the view that people who had anticipated that if they got to Australia they would get a particular outcome should not be rewarded, but are in fact resettled where they will be safe and secure, but not necessarily the destination of their choice.

 Question: I've just got one more question. Of the 2,000 places, does that mean you're allowing for the fact that there may be more boat people that will make claims on shore?

 Philip Ruddock: Now look, you make an estimate as to what you think you're likely to need. Last year we made an estimate and as the year unfolded I was able to add 1,600 places to offshore. We've set aside a certain number which we think we may require. If it's not required we will put them into further offshore processing. I would like to be able to come along and say we don't require any, but 2,000 is about the figure that I have set in every humanitarian program that I've been Minister except for the last two when we had unauthorised boat arrivals in large numbers.

 Question: To what extent do you think this announcement will appease critics of the government's handling of refugees/asylum seekers or illegal immigrants?

 Philip Ruddock: Look, the announcements are not intended to appease critics. I don't expect that those people who are critical are essentially going to stop advocating on behalf of those people who want to make asylum claims in Australia. I think they're naive.

 Â 

 The idea that an international protection system can survive an accommodation of those who essentially have the money to travel and to choose where they want to be refugees is naive and it flies in the face of what happened to Switzerland and what happened to the Dutch for a long period of time and the fact is that rapid increases in onshore arrivals mean diminished capacity to be able to assist on the basis of taking those that you take by choice, essentially those through offshore settlement programs.

 What we're doing is maximising the number of places and supporting very strongly the international protection system. All I can say is that having recently returned from meetings with governments around the world, the problems that we're dealing with are problems that they are grappling with and governments that have been implementing refugee programs struggle very much in maintaining popular support for those programs when they get a 50% increase in arrivals.

 Question: So how would you briefly sum up how you would explain it?

 Philip Ruddock: Well, I think this is, and I said this today, this is an immigration program which the public can be confident is well-managed, is operating in the national interest and enables us to continue to be a generous contributor to alleviating the plight of refugees who have the greatest need around the world as well as accommodating Australians' aspirations for genuine family reunion.

 Question: Minister, is this a slight backdown on the position by the Government to give some places, some humanitarian places to those who are offshore in places like PNG and Nauru?

 Philip Ruddock:No.

 Question: - -whereas the government has previously said that they would never let those people set foot- -Philip Ruddock: No, look, that was Mr Crean's argument, it wasn't ours. Mr Crean was saying that because we said these people when they came by boat weren't going to set foot in Australia, that that meant that we weren't going to shoulder our share of the burden. And we never put that position. The Prime Minister made it very clear and I can take you back to the quotes he made, that Australia would play its part in relation to burden sharing and particularly for those who have linkages with Australia. And there is certainly no backdown in what we have implemented here.

 Question: Did the UNHCR ask Australia to take more refugees for its humanitarian program?

 Philip Ruddock: We had discussions with the UNHCR and we do so on a regular basis. And I'm sure if I asked the UNHCR, "Would you like us to take more?" they'd say yes.

 Question: Did they ask you, though?

 Philip Ruddock: No. That's the point. We have discussions with them in the knowledge of what we're intending to do. Look, it is fine to say we would like you to do more, but we are the most generous contributor. It's like going along to your most generous benefactor and saying, "Everybody else is able to do something, we appreciate what you've done, but we really want you to do more." The discussions we have with the UNHCR are primarily about where the priority should be and those priorities have been centred primarily on Africa and the Middle East.

 Question: When do you expect to start?

 Philip Ruddock: Well, we've started already. At the moment we're going through the process of character and health checks in relation to those people that have close linkages with Australia and we'll be moving fairly quickly on that front.

 Question: How many have you got?

 Philip Ruddock: Look, the number is fairly modest at the moment, I don't know the precise number but it's certainly around about the 50 mark.

 Question: Out of 1,500?

 Philip Ruddock: Out of 300 that are at the moment found to be refugees. We're not talking about people who aren't refugees and we've said in relation to those people that we will be making arrangements as soon as they meet character and health checks for them to be moved.

 We have already moved one family of five and the reason for that was that there was an illness involving, I think, a mother with four family members. And they came onshore on a safe haven visa which has been programmed to end at a date coincidental with the date of the husband who is in Australia on a temporary protection visa so that in that case the safe haven arrangement will terminate at the same time that the husband's visa will terminate unless they're able to continue to maintain claims for refugee status.

 Question: What are the nationalities of these people?

 Philip Ruddock: I think they would be primarily, as I understand it, Iraqi. There may be some other small numbers from other Middle Eastern countries or Afghanistan but they're primarily Iraqi. The situation is that our pattern and the UNHCR's pattern of decision-making has been broadly similar.

 There have been few Afghan claims approved at this point and people have been invited to put further information. So you can assume if people are being invited to put further information that, prima facie, their claims are not claims that would succeed. If they would succeed they would have succeeded already. So if people have been asked to put further information it is reasonably safe to assume that while that information might influence the decisions, that the primary decision or the initial decision was likely to be negative.

 Question: You're expecting some relocation decisions next week?

 Philip Ruddock: No, I'm expecting further announcements by the UNHCR and ourselves during the course of next week. The first decisions were made several weeks ago and that processing is a continuing process. There are 1,500 and 400 have been the subject of decisions, so there's 1,100 outstanding.

 Question: What's the rationale for the four year target for the non-humanitarian program? Is that designed to influence further demographics?

 Philip Ruddock: No, it's designed to enable decision-makers to plan with a greater degree of certainty. What we've essentially done is pick up some of the approaches that have been taken by the Canadians of having some longer term planning targets out there, but we've introduced a degree of flexibility, plus or minus, but we would expect, and the substantial difference between Canada and Australia is that we would expect to come in broadly within that range, which has not been the Canadian experience.

 Question: Is this the first time there's been a four year target?

 Philip Ruddock: Well, it's the first time that I've had a four year target, yes.

 Question: How do you expect Mr Carr to react to the fact that he's going to be taking more migrants in Sydney for the next four years?

 Philip Ruddock: I don't know that it means that. I hope that Mr Carr will see in the initiatives that we've taken a much more determined approach to get a better dispersal both statewise and regionally of the migration outcome and I'd be happy to talk to Mr Carr about ways and means in which we might be able to even get a better regional dispersal in New South Wales.

 A lot of the initiatives that we use in other states are not necessarily enthusiastically available in New South Wales, it tends to be more broadly based and I'd be happy to talk to Mr Carr about how he might be able to get a better regional dispersal in New South Wales as well as to other states and territories.

 But I just make this point, the growth in the pipeline that I've been talking to you about has given us a capacity to be able to set an overall lower target than was potentially possible, potentially possible, and to increase the pass mark, and in increasing the pass mark get a better outcome from regional dispersal

 initiatives.

 Because by increasing the pass mark by five essentially means groups of people who might have otherwise been able to come to Sydney will no longer be eligible to come to Sydney, but may still be eligible to pick up a place by having regional sponsorship or territory sponsorship from one of the states that wants to have a larger proportion of the migration program.

 So it also means that the skill matching database will be more effective because there'll be a larger pool of people whose skills will not have been sufficient to get them into the general skilled program entry but will have been sufficient to get them on the skill database list where those states and regional bodies that are essentially headhunting can look as to where they might find the people with skills, particular skills that they need.

 Question: Minister, the people already let through from the Pacific, were they on the Tampa?

 Philip Ruddock: I think they'd have been mixed.

 Question: Earlier on you talked about 1,270 people in detention on shore, 927 are ready for removal, 350 you said are before the courts. Does that mean their first application for asylum has failed?

 Philip Ruddock: Let me be more precise. Perhaps you'd better go and get for me, Steve, the precise figures, if someone's going to quote me precisely. I'll give you the date and I'll give you the precise numbers, but if we can test my memory, my recollection was for about the end of April it was 927 available for removal and 1,270 or thereabouts, it could have been plus or minus another five or 10, but of that order, 1,270 that were being held.

 Now, all I did was take away 927 from 1270, so that's 350. Now of that group, let me just go through precisely what we're dealing with, we would have people who have - everybody would have been assessed, but there is still somewhere in those numbers - all right, I'm not doing as well as I thought. As at 3 May it's 1,259. At the close of business on 26 April there were 824 available for removal. What that means is the 927 which was available on the 5 April, we have obviously removed almost 100 people in that time.

 Question: What do you mean available for removal? What exactly does available for removal mean?

 Philip Ruddock: It means that they have no further matter before a court or the Department that requires consideration and it means they are available to be removed. Now it means, if they volunteer and they suddenly produce a passport we can put them on a plane tomorrow. It means that if they're difficult about it we have to identify them to the country that we believe they are from, get a travel document for them and get permission for them to be able to travel on that travel document home.

 Question: Minister, what I'm asking is, are the people in detention in Australia, have they all been rejected through the process? That's what you're saying?

 Philip Ruddock: I'm saying there are broadly three categories now under which people would be held. A decision, a primary decision may have been taken, but they still cannot be given a positive answer because there is a character issue that has to be addressed. And I think there is a small number of people in that category. I don't know the precise number but there is a small number of people in that category. They could be a refugee, but there is a security issue or a character issue that has to be finalised.

 No person is entitled to refugee status unless they meet character. They can be excluded under article 1F of the Refugee Convention if they're of bad character. So there are a small number of character issues. The bulk of people, and I think it's now several hundred, are before the various courts, the Federal Court, the magistracy, the Federal Court, the Full Federal Court or the High Court. And the difference would be those who are before the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 Question: You said in the conference before that these people in detention are ready for deportation. You described them as rejectees, do you think that is an appropriate term for you to use?

 Philip Ruddock: I think it's an accurate term.

 Question: Why, sir?

 Philip Ruddock: Because we're dealing primarily, and I said primarily, I didn't say all, I said primarily with people who, if they have made asylum claims they've been found wanting and it doesn't mean that by testing to the limits people can't force us to keep them here. It doesn't mean that in testing to the limits some might still get a decision.

 I read recently that after the enactment of the privative clause, the number of decisions in refugee matters and immigration matters which have been negative to me or the Department is 2%. So what I'm really saying is if we've got 200 people making a claim, at the moment if you look at the number of people whose claims are reviewed by the courts and on a basis of law got up and have asked us to look at it again, it would be four. So it's a very small proportion that might be able to use the courts if you look at the recent decisions of the courts in relation to migration matters.

 And if you look at the Refugee Review Tribunal, say you've got 100, you might get 20, you might get 30% to get up, you might get another 10 or 15. We are talking about a very small proportion of the people who, even if they get a positive decision, will be found to be refugees. We're dealing with people in the main who have been through the process and found not to be refugees. Now what would you call them? They're not asylum seekers, their claims have been rejected.

 Question: But Minister that's a very recent figure. Up until, I believe the end of last year the beginning of this year the success rate for the Federal Court was something like 67% overturning.

 Philip Ruddock: No, no never.

 Question: And then that shifted- -Philip Ruddock: Never.

 Question: - -in the last six months- -Philip Ruddock: Never.

 Question: - -so what figures are you quoting?

 Philip Ruddock: I'm quoting the figures that have been provided to me by the Department on the numbers of people who have had claims overturned - I'm sorry - had an adverse decision overturned by the courts and where we've been asked to look at it again. Now, I do actually have the table. If you want to spent a bit of time to go round with me I'll actually get it out for you but the proportion now that are getting decisions overturned by the courts is 2%.

 Question: In the last six months- -Philip Ruddock: Yes, 2%, since the enactment of the privative clause in September, 2%. And before that I think it was of the order of about 15% or 16%, by the courts. Now, the Refugee Review Tribunal overturn rates for people in detention, not generally, was of a higher order and those figures were in relation to detention populations only and they're now historic figures but they were of a higher order in relation to earlier cohorts.

 But look, what we're seeing now is that when you've gone six months without boat arrivals you are dealing with people whose claims, if they're bona fide, are going to have been determined and found to be bona fide and they're going to have been released. The cohort of detainees today is a cohort of people where all the easy claims have been dealt with and what you have are people whose claims, prima facie, are not for approval.

 Now, I don't try to dissemble in relation to these things. What I'm saying is, yes, it is possible that with 200

 cases before the courts you might get one or two cases that are going to be overturned. It is possible with 100 or so cases before the Refugee Review Tribunal you may get another 20 or 30 or 40 that will get a positive decision but, in the main, we are dealing with people whose claims have been considered and I ask - people don't like me referring to them as unlawful entrants. It's an accurate description of people who have breached our law, they've come unlawfully.

 People have wanted to use the term asylum-seeker because they think that that's generally a more benign term which suggests that people who have come without lawful authority ought to be able to remain here and all I'm saying is we are now in a situation where the people who are detained are not asylum-seekers, they're people whose claims have been rejected and I've said, what term would you apply? I think the term rejectee is an accurate term.

 Question: Minister, can I just recap? So last financial year Australia offered more than 13,000 humanitarian places and now we're almost 12,000, so we're offering less.

 Philip Ruddock: No, we're not.

 No, we're not. Let me just say that I go to some press conferences like this and people would tell me, because they've picked this up from some of the refugee organisations, that Australia had not used all its places and that was so, two years ago.

 Because we had a big backlog of temporary protection visa holders that we were going to have to accommodate, we essentially said we'll go slow on the processing for this year but we will carry the places over so that when we've got this big lot of temporary protection visas that we're going to have to accommodate, we've got enough places for them.

 And last year we had a carry-over of about 3,000 places and - that was two years ago. This year we've had a carry-over of about, or estimated carry-over of round about 1,000 places and so we had 1,300 to play with. This year, I don't know precisely what the carry-over will be but there will probably be another carry-over and it will be the carry-over plus 12,000 that we can accommodate during the course of the year.

 Question: Minister, why are those places unmet?

 Philip Ruddock: Essentially because when you're processing there is always the potential - when you've set a target there is always the potential that when you get to the end of the year that somebody's medical check hasn't been finished, their security clearance hasn't come through and so in terms of actually being able to give a person a visa, and having them on a plane and on their way, there are some logistic problems in being able to accommodate it. The reason for having the carry-over is because quite frankly - she won't mind me taking her name in vain - Margaret Piper, who runs the Refugee Council, came to one of my consultations one year and said, look, you weren't able to visa, I think around about 100 people - it was about 100 people - during the course of the year and that means those places have been lost. What are you going to do about it?

 I said, well, we had no intention of losing the places and I went back to the Government and I got a budget decision that the places, once they'd been funded, were guaranteed and if they weren't used one year you'd carry them over to the next. And so it's ensuring that you're able to maximise the numbers of people you're helping. What would be worse would be to say we've got 12,000 places, to process only 11 and then to see those places lost and that's why there's a carry-over. It's good public policy. Thanks very much. Good to see you all.
