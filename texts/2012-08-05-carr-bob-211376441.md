 Senator Bob Carr and King Abdullah of  Jordan exchange views on regional political  developments  Media release 

 5 August 2012 

 His Majesty King Abdullah II on Thursday met with visiting Australian Foreign Minister  Bob Carr and discussed political developments in the region, mainly the Syrian crisis.  

 The King voiced Jordan's concern over the escalating violence in Syria and its dangerous  repercussions for the region's countries.  

 He also stressed the importance of finding a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis that leads to  an end to violence and bloodshed and averts the Syrian people more suffering.  

 Talks during the meeting also dealt with efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East.  

 The King underlined the need for concerted international efforts to advance the peace process  and help the Palestinians and Israelis return to the negotiating table to arrive at a just and  permanent settlement that addresses all final status solutions and leads to the establishment of  an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.  

 During the meeting, which was attended by Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh and Director of  the King's Office Imad Fakhoury, the King also reviewed with the Australian Minister  bilateral cooperation and means of boosting it in various fields.  

 The Australian Minister valued Jordan's reform process led by His Majesty as well as the  Kingdom's role to achieve peace and stability in the region and address regional challenges.  

 Senator Carr expressed Australia's readiness to support Jordan in its efforts to receive Syrian  refugees, and provide humanitarian services for them.
