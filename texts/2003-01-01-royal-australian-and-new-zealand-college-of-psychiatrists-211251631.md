  “DETENTION C E N T E  ENQUIRY  NEEDS TO GO THE WHOLE WAY” 

  Medical and Mental Health bodies have today called for a sweeping and comprehensive enquiry into 

  all detention centres run by Australasian Correctional Management. T h i s  call for urgent independent 

  review follows allegations of poor management in the Woomera detention centre on ABC Four 

  Corners last night. 

  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, Royal Australasian College of 

  Physicians and Australian Medical Association are ooncemed by increasing evidence of the adverse 

  effects of detention, inadequate clinical services and have joined in the call for an urgent overhaul of 

  the management of Asylum Seekers. 

  “Tupayms money should not be wasted by limiting any enyuiry just to Waornera. We 

  need an urgent review af all Australasian Correctional Manugeme)if run detention 

  centres. The concerns about staflrzg, substandard services and child abuse are too 

  serious to ignortj ‘ I  said Dr Louise Newman of the W C P .  

  Doctors in New South Wales have already lodged a medical ncgliyence complaint against 

  Australasian Correctional Management at Villawood Detention Centre with the Health Care 

  Complaints Commission. 

  Suicide Prevention Australia Chair, Dr Michael Dudley, said that self-harm and suicidal behaviour 

  occurred in all detention centres, not just in Woomern.

  ‘iiustralasian Correctional Management run centres drive detainees to the poinl of 

  suicide. Rates of self-harm in delention centre,y nre six times that of the community. 

  nix is an epidemic afecting even young children and reflects a system In collapse”  said Dr Dud@ 

  Mental health organisations including the Mental Health Council of Australia and the Beyondblue 

  National Depression Initiative called for release of accurate figures on rates of self-harm and 

  depression. They have described Minister Ruddock’s comments about depression not being a mental 

  illness as ‘&inaccurate and misleading” especially in the light of the Government’s own National 

  Mental Health Strategy. 

  “The harm that we are doing to children and youngpeopk will remain with them for 

  the rest of their liva ” said Dr Jill Sewell. Deputy F‘resident. RACP. We have a d u g  

  of care to children and young people regardless of whether they are refuges or 

  “asylum seekers ’ I  us Minister Ruddock calls them. ‘ I  

  The Four Carriers report highlights the grim situation being faced by detainees and gives a graphic 

  portrayal of the poor health outcomes experienced by people in detention that were sa starkly 

  illustrated in the report of the Professional Alliance for the Health of Asylum Seekers and their 

  Children presentcd to the HREOC Enquiry last year. 

  “Whilst Woomeru is closed, children and vulnerable people remain iii ACM detention 

  centres where there ure very similar concerns about inadequate care and mental 

  deterioration including severe depression” said Dr Louise Newman qf the RAWCP. 

  AMA Federal President, Dr K m y n  Phelps, said the allegations of mismanagement at WoomeTa and 

  other detention centTes presented by Four Comers call out for Eijudicial inquiry. 

  “The health of men, women and children in the care of our Government hus been 

  jeopardisad. As u civilised mAeiy, we cannot turn a blind eye to this,failure to uphold 

  basic human rights. There must be a judiciul inquiry and we mirsi also question 

  whsihsr privatisation is the right way to go in managing these centres. The 

  Government must maintain its duty of cure, ’’ Dr Phelps said,
