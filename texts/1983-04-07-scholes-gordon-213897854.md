 .  VIETNAMESE REFUGEE BOAT

 GIVEN AID BY NAVY

 Seventy-four Vietnamese refugees who fled Vietnam in a  35-foot -wooden boat five days ago bound for Indonesia, were  given assistance by two RAN ships in the South China Sea late  yesterday afternoon. The destroyer tender,  HMAS Stalwart,  and 

 the guided missile frigate, HMAS Adelaide, currently part of a  five-ship task group on a three month deployment to Asia, " encountered the refugee boat about 240 miles east of Malaysia.

 A three man team from HMAS Stalwart (the executive officer  medical officer and engineering officer) went by ship's boat to  investigate the condition of the boat and its occupants.  .

 The medical officer,  Lieutenant Commander Andrew Marsden,  checked the condition of the refugees - 32 men,  22 women and 20  children - and reported that all were in good health and no medical  treatment was necessary.  He reported that the youngest child oh  board was about two years old. About 10 children were less than 

 three years old, and the oldest refugee was about J O.

 The Stalwart team reported that the boat was seaworthy  and that the refugees had ample supplies of food,  water and fuel.   However their compass was suspect and HMAS Stalwart provided x-  them with a working compass together with additional food and · water,  sweets for the children,  a navigational chart,  and extra 

 fuel.  ·â
