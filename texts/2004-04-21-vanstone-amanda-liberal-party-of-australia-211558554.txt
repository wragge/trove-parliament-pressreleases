 Kids Need to Know that Australia Does Say YES to  Refugees

 VPS 063/2004

 Australians have every right to be proud of their tradition of helping the world's most needy people. Since the  1940s we have resettled over 620 000 refugees and displaced people. 

 It saddens me that some people choose to give school children a politically-biased account of our refugee  policy.

 From the letters I have received from children, it is clear that they are being told that Australia is racist and we  don't accept refugees. The fact is that 75% of our refugee and humanitarian intake this year will come from  Africa.

 In order to set the record straight, today I am launching Australia says YES to refugees - a facts-based  information kit to inform the debate on Australia's proud refugee history. 

 These kits present the facts simply with clear up-to-date fact sheets, personal stories from refugees, posters  and postcards. 

 It should be common knowledge that Australia is extending its welcome to those most in need through the  front door thanks to a strong economy and strong border control.

 The fact is that in the past 10 years Australia has resettled more than 100 000 people of humanitarian concern  and that our humanitarian program is the third largest dedicated annual resettlement program in the world.

 Our proud history of helping those most in need continued last month when I announced the ultimate dividend  on strong border control - a 50 percent increase to the refugee intake within Australia's Humanitarian Program. 

 Australia's Humanitarian Program has been at 12 000 places per annum for the past seven years. From 2004-05 that figure will increase to 13 000 places. The extra 1000 places will go to the refugee component and  another 1000 places will be shifted from humanitarian component to the refugee component of the program,  taking the refugee component from 4000 to 6000.

 These places target people facing the real threat of persecution, often trapped in horrendous conditions in  refugee camps and with no way to return home. 

 I'm doing my part to tell their story - to inform the debate on Australia's response to refugees. In the coming 

 weeks these kits will be sent to schools around Australia. I'm offering a terrific resource to schools so parents  and teachers can also do their part to inform the debate.
