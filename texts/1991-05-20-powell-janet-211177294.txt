  SCRAP BUSINESS MIGRATION SCHEME - PQWELL 

  Australian Democrats Leader, Senator Janet Powell, has renewed  the Democrats call for the scrapping of the Business Migration  Program. 

  Senator Powell said today; "Reports of rorts in the Business  Migration process have been circulating for some time, and now  appear to be correct. Australia is not gaining anything from  continuing the program." 

  "We've been talking with ethnic organisations in various parts  of Australia over the past few months / and the advice from 

  these people is that the scheme has been appallinqly abused,  badly administered and policed in a less than adequate 

  manner." 

  "Any government sponsored program in which the same $500, 000  'entry fee' can be recycled from person to person, and from 

  country to country, in a manner ~hich makes a mockery of the  scheme / s guidelines and an international laughing stock of  Australia's migration program, has outlived its usefulness,  and should be scrapped immediately." 

  ''The Democrats believe the Goverrunent should be placing mo.re  emphasis on the Family Reunion and Refugee categories, as well  as putting more resources into training Australians rather  than robbing other countries of their skilled people, 

  especially as our unemployment numbers reach record levels."  "Minister Hand should act to terminate this rort forthwith,"  Senator Powell concluded.·
