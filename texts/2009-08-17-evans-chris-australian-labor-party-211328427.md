 UNHCR report confirms worldwide increase in asylum  seekers 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said  Australia will continue to meet its international obligations to refugees forced  out of their own countries due to war or fear of persecution. 

 The UNHCR 2008 Global Trends Report shows there were 42 million forcibly  displaced people worldwide at the end of 2008, which included 15.2 million  refugees. A staggering 44 per cent of all refugees and asylum seekers were  children under the age of 18. 

 Senator Evans said the report confirms that the increase in people seeking  asylum in Australia is part of a worldwide trend driven by insecurity,  persecution and conflict. 

 The UNHCR report shows that asylum claims increased worldwide by 28 per  cent in 2008, with a dramatic escalation in the number of asylum seekers  lodging claims in South Africa. 

 Europe remains the primary destination for asylum seekers with 333 000  claims registered in 2008, predominantly in France (35 400), the United  Kingdom (30 500) and Italy (30 300). The United States received 49 600 new  asylum claims and Canada 34 800. South Africa received 207 000 new claims  from asylum seekers. 

 Senator Evans said that the 4750 people seeking asylum in Australia in 2008  was relatively small in global terms. 

 The UNHCR report states that one third of all refugees were in the Asia  Pacific region, with Pakistan housing 1.8 million - virtually all from  Afghanistan. Afghanistan is still the leading country of origin for refugees, with  2.8 million Afghans receiving assistance from UNHCR in 2008 - representing  one in four of all refugees worldwide. 

 ‘We have an obligation as a wealthy and stable society to assist in the global  solution to the worldwide refugee crisis,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘Australia, along with the United States and Canada, will continue to play a  leading role in providing resettlement opportunities for some of the most  vulnerable people in the world. 

 ‘The UNHCR has called on those traditional resettlement countries to not  resile from our commitment to refugees during the global economic downturn. 

 ‘In 2009-10, Australia will welcome 13 750 people under our Humanitarian  Program - an increase of 250 places on the previous year.’ 

 Senator Evans said the size and composition of Australia’s humanitarian  program is guided by the UNHCR’s world resettlement priorities and the views  of the Australian community. 

 The main focus will remain on the Middle East, Africa and Asia, with refugees  from Iraq, Burma, Afghanistan, Sudan and Bhutan, among other nationalities,  to be resettled.
