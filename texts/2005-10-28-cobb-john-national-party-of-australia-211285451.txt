 Media Centre  Refugee History Unveiled at Maritime Museum 

 28 October 2005 

 A piece of Australia’s refugee history will be unveiled at the Australian  National Maritime Museum in Sydney on Saturday 29 October, the  Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Senator John Cobb, said  today. 

 ‘As part of the celebrations for Refugee Week, the Maritime Museum will  display the former refugee boat, the Tu Do, which first arrived in Darwin in  November 1977,’ Minister Cobb said. 

 ‘The museum has conducted an extensive oral history project with the  family of Tan Thanh Lu, who built the boat and carried his family and 35  others to a new life in Australia. 

 ‘The family will be attending the event and other speakers from the  Vietnamese community will share their stories.  

 ‘This event presents a great opportunity for us to reflect on the enormous  contribution that the Vietnamese community has made to the cultural,  social and economic life of Australia. 

 ‘This event will also present a great opportunity for Australians to  celebrate and acknowledge the world-class service they provide in  assisting new migrants and refugees to resettle in Australia. 

 ‘Our history of helping people resettle in Australia goes back 60 years to  the end of World War Two, and since then, we’ve helped more than 650  000 people in humanitarian need to build new lives in Australia. 

 ‘Australia is one of the top three countries providing resettlement  programs for refugees and other persons in humanitarian need, with an  annual intake which has risen to 13 000 people every year. 

 ‘As a result of our settlement efforts for both migrants and refugees over  this period, today, nearly one in four Australians were born overseas, and  we are one of the most successful examples of multiculturalism in the  world,’ Minister Cobb said. 

 ‘Every Australian can be proud of our efforts over 60 years of helping  people from around 200 countries build new lives in Australia.’
