 Senate Leaders Debate Needed

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has called for a Senate leaders debate to give voters maximum choice during the election campaign.

 “The Greens wrote to the ABC over a week ago suggesting it host an alternative debate with the leaders of all Senate parties participating,” Senator Brown said.

 “This would provide voters with a much wider choice of ideas as well as a livelier debate.

 “Such a forum would provide a breakout debate on the big issues, like asylum seekers and the destruction of native forests, where Mr Beazley and Mr Howard are indistinguishable.

 “The debate could take place at any time during the next four weeks of the campaign and I invite all Senate party leaders as well as ABC TV to accept our offer.

 “The Senate is crucial to this election. All legislation must pass both houses of parliament and neither major party will control the Senate after the November 10 poll.

 “I would also be delighted to take on Kim Beazley or the Prime Minister head to head on issues like education and the environment. Anytime anywhere,” Senator Brown concluded.
