 IMMIGRATION BUDGET STATEMENT 1

 IMMIGRATION PORTFOLIO FEDERAL BUDGET 1991-92

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  fairs, Mr Gerry Hand, announced his portfolio budget which  contains a number of initiatives to meet the challenges he  expects to face over the coming financial year.

 Estimated outlays would be $336 million with an achievement  record of 37 per cent in recovery of the outlays.

 Mr Hand said^that the overall challenge was to maintain and  if possible improve services and programs to clients, within  the constraint of more efficient use of resources.

 Following his extensive consultations around Australia with  a wide range of community groups, Mr Hand said he had  expressed concern about the level of resources for  settlement services and programs.

 I am pleased that I have been able to meet medium-term  demands by increased funding in this Budget. Nevertheless I  am conscious that if more funding is required in the longer  term, I may need to make suitable adjustments across other  areas of the portfolio".

 The Minister said that other major challenges for the  P0rtfÂ°li-0 were to resolve the large caseload of applications  for determination of refugee status and the progressive  reduction of the numbers of illegal entrants.

 Mr Hand announced the following measures (see separate  media releases for details);

 - the allocation of increased resources for settlement  services;

 - the provision of additional funds and staff for on-shore  processing of claims for refugee status and humanitarian  stay in Australia;

 - 2-

 - enhanced immigration compliance and control arrangements;

 - funding for reception and detention centres for people who  arrive in Australia without prior screening or approval;

 - provision for recovery of welfare benefits and health  costs incurred by migrants covered by an Assurance of  Support; and

 - increased fees for some services (see attachment to this  media release).

 The Minister also announced that funding for the Local Government Development Program had been renewed at a higher  level of $2.5 million.
