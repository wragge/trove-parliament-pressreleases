 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Treat West Papuans like East Timorese  Senator Nettle, 19th January 2006  Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the Federal Government to treat  the newly arrived West Papuan asylum seekers in the same way as the East Timorese  who fled Indonesian repression in the 1990s by letting them live in the community, not  mandatory detention.    

 "Australia should treat the West Papuan asylum seekers like we treated the East Timorese  in the 1990s, claims for asylum should be assessed while they live in the community  rather than locking them up in detention," said Senator Nettle.    

 "These people are our neighbours and we owe a historical debt to treat them with respect  and dignity. They assisted our diggers in World War II and General Douglas MacArthur  had his headquarters in the West Papuan capital Jayapura during the war.    

 "The Government has a chance to show it has learned from recent scandals and should  now implement a better approach to asylum seekers by not putting them in a detention  centre. They should not be sent to Christmas Island.    

 "Australia has accepted West Papuan asylum seekers in the recent past and with the  escalation of repression of the West Papuan independence movement by Indonesia, there  is a clear case that these people need our protection.    

 "They've trekked across the jungle and made a dangerous sea voyage. It is clear they are  activists in the West Papuan struggle for freedom and independence. The Government  should recognise this and treat these people with dignity and compassion.
