 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 6 December 2012   

 Dangerous returns to Sri Lanka must stop   

 The Government has been forced to acknowledge it has been using shadowy processes to  deport Tamil refugees to Sri Lanka where they face torture, imprisonment and worse, the  Australian Greens said today.   

 “The Government must change the law to ensure that genuine refugees are not deported  back to danger,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Government and the Opposition are locked in a desperate race to the bottom that has  seen hundreds of people deported without access to independent advice, due process or  certainty that the right decision has been made.   

 “Rather than ad hoc fixes just to avoid the High Court, the Government needs to fix the law  to ensure a fair screening process for all potential refugees and establishment of a robust  independent reviewer to check that the right decision has been made.   

 “We know many Sri Lankans are ultimately found to be refugees but it is increasingly clear  that the Government is determined to slam the door shut rather than properly assess their  protection claims.   

 “Human rights are regularly violated in Sri Lanka so returning people there must be done  with the utmost caution, but hundreds of people have already been returned without any  second opinion or monitoring of their safety.   

 “Australia has international obligations under the Refugee Convention to assess the claims  of all people, not just the 56 refugees at the centre of the Government’s back-flip this week.   

 “The only way to ensure a fair process that’s consistent with our refugee obligations is to  establish clear safety nets in Australian law to ensure that no one is deported to danger.
