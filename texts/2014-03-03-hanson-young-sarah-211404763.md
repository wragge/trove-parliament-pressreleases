 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 3 March 2014   

 Morrison can’t guarantee safety,  transfers to Manus must stop   

 The Australian Greens have called on the Immigration Minister to immediately  halt transfers of refugees to Manus Island because it is clearly impossible for him  to guarantee their safety.   

 “The Minister knows that people aren’t safe inside the centre but has arrogantly  said that he’ll keep sending refugees there if he wants to,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “In the short term the transfers must stop immediately and, in the long term, the  centre must be closed down.   

 “The lack of care from the Abbott Government when it comes to people’s safety  on Manus Island has been both predictable and deeply disappointing.   

 “Allowing weeks to pass while barely acknowledging Mr Berati’s death, except to  blame him for his own brutal demise, represents a new low for the Australian  Government.   

 “A Parliamentary Inquiry is essential for getting to the bottom of what happened  and holding the Government to account.”
