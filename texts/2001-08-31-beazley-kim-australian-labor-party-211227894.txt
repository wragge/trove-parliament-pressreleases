 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Kofi Annan, Tampa, Asylum Seekers

 Transcript - Parliament House, Canberra - 31 August 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: Firstly, can I say that I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister is talking to Kofi Annan and talking to others to try and get an international and regional diplomatic solution to this problem? This problem was always only going to be resolved by an international diplomatic solution. That is why we said yesterday that the border protection legislation is not in our national interest because it has the potential to bring us into international disrepute.

 The Prime Minister at the end of the week is doing what he should have been doing at the beginning of the week. And yesterday in Parliament he still mocked the Caucus resolution on how this matter ought to be resolved and paradoxically today seems to be attempting to adopt that Caucus resolution in trying to resolve it.

 The Prime Minister also in our difficulties this week has shown what happens when you neglect relations over a lengthy period of time. We are trying to make up in five days for five years of neglect on this matter. Our task is harder because the diplomatic efforts now being done are being done at the end of a period of time when it has been possible for people to strike attitudes and develop views.

 The relationships with Indonesia on this matter should have been put in place at the beginning of the week. The involvement of the International Maritime Organisation should have been sorted at the beginning of the week. There always was going to be this central problem in resolving this difficulty and that is: where will the people go? Where will their safe haven be? Now we are working on that, and I welcome it.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the Prime Minister indicated this morning that he thinks that there is no short-term solution to this at all - that it won't be resolved overnight. Do you think from where you stand that that is the case?

 BEAZLEY: That may well be the case. That may very well be the case, and what that does, of course, is place a premium on good international diplomacy. I see the Prime Minister is still trying to talk to President Megawati of Indonesia. Of course, the conversation that you would have had with President Megawati at the beginning of the week would be a very different one, and much easier, then the conversation that you would have with President Megawati at the end of the week. Because in the

 intervening four or five days there has been the possibility of hardening of positions, of striking of attitudes, of developing of resentments.

 If you had dealt with this at the beginning of the week like a Prime Minister and not a politician we would be in a very different situation from that which we are in now.

 JOURNALIST: It seems like that there is a solution to split these people up through other countries around the world. Do you think Australia should commit to taking a percentage of them, or a number of them?

 BEAZLEY: Where we came from to start off this whole deliberation, if you like, was with a sound international legal position pursued for sound domestic reasons. The sound international position was that the obligations for landfall for the people who are rescued lay elsewhere. And, of course, the Government and all governments have to be rightly concerned that they maintain control over their borders and over immigration across their borders. That was always the correct position. The question is the implementation.

 Now, there still ought to be an opportunity to secure those objectives but do it in a way that enhances rather that detracts from your reputation and what we all ought to be doing, at least those of us in political life who are not commentators but activists, what we all ought to be doing is trying to secure that initial outcome.

 There was nothing wrong with the initial objectives and if you can continue to pursue those initial objectives you should be attempting to do so. So I think, to tell you the truth Matt, your question is premature. What we should…

 JOURNALIST: New Zealand has offered. Surely we should…?

 BEAZLEY: Again, come back to the point that I made earlier on that. New Zealand has made that offer. What we are attempting to achieve here is an outcome that matches the initial objectives - it is going to get harder and harder. But at this point of time I think what we ought to be focusing on is getting a safe haven for those folk on board that ship. Getting them out of the hair of the Norwegian captain and the Norwegian company. That is what we ought to be focusing on now.

 JOURNALIST: You don't rule out as an option taking some or all of these people?

 BEAZLEY: What I am saying is that that question is premature that what we ought to be doing now at this moment is trying to get them safe haven elsewhere. That is what our Caucus resolution was.

 JOURNALIST: Wouldn't an offer from Australia be an offer of goodwill that could cause a breakthrough from other countries, including Indonesia?

 BEAZLEY: It is premature to make that call, frankly, at this point. The Prime Minister has only just begun to do what he should have been doing at the beginning of this week, and that is trying to get an international solution.

 JOURNALIST: It might not be premature for the people on board the boat, though. They have been there a week.

 BEAZLEY: This will take a while to resolve and if the Government is doing what it said it was doing it

 will be making those people on board that boat as comfortable as possible. And we have always thought that that was necessary and we hope very much that that is being done - in which case there is time to resolve this issue.

 JOURNALIST: What do you read into President Megawati's absolute concentration on Cabinet affairs to the exclusion of finding five minutes to call the Prime Minister?

 BEAZLEY: What I read into it is failed diplomacy. That is what I read into it. I doubt very much, even if she had not been in Indonesia, the Prime Minister wouldn't have had the slightest problem getting through to her last Sunday. But since that point of time, there has been an opportunity for attitudes to harden and as attitudes harden communication becomes more difficult. So what would have been a complicated and difficult enough problem at the beginning of the week has become an even more complicated one at the end of it.

 But don't miss the point on this: the Prime Minister's motivation here has been mixed. The right side of his motivation has been to protect the integrity of our migration program and to uphold the integrity of international legal obligations.

 The wrong side of the Prime Minister's concerns has been to seek political advantage. And having got those two mixed up the balance went the wrong way and now we pay a penalty on the right side.

 JOURNALIST: So should the UN be called in to arbitrate who gets these asylum seekers?

 BEAZLEY: Well, one of the valuable things about being a member of the United Nations is that you can occasionally call upon them for help when you have got a few problems on your plate. That is why I said that I welcomed the fact that he was involving Kofi Annan in this, and I welcome the attitude which has been struck by the New Zealand Prime Minister.

 JOURNALIST: Should that include a request for them to determine these claims?

 BEAZLEY: I think the United Nations involvement is a little more complex than that - it is more of a diplomatic involvement. If you get the United Nations involved, like in the way in which the Prime Minister has, it is with not so much arbitrating this particular matter but assisting you with diplomacy ensuring that you can find some safe havens the people.

 JOURNALIST: Mary Robinson has looked otherwise than diplomacy and said that we should look into our hearts and consider that these people are stuck on board a ship in the tropics and we should simply let them ashore.

 BEAZLEY: I think, as I said, the thing that we should be engaged in at the moment is to try and find them a safe haven that secures all of our objectives. We are not ungenerous people when it comes to dealing with people who come to this country legally and, in fact, we are not ungenerous to people who come to this country illegally. They have a set of rights and they are allowed to pursue those rights in accordance with our international obligations.

 That we may now with our excellent record be appearing blemished in the eyes of the rest of the world represents a unique failure. There is no reason for Australia to be regarded like that. It takes a particular level of incompetence on the part of the Government of this country to achieve that status.

 JOURNALIST: The HMAS Arunta should arrive there today. Should it tow or force the Tampa back out

 into international waters?

 BEAZLEY: Take a look at the size of the Tampa and take a look at the size of HMAS Arunta - I don't think the Tampa is going to be towed anywhere.

 JOURNALIST: Should they go on board and force it back into international waters?

 BEAZLEY: I think that that situation has long since passed. It was never a sensible idea, as I pointed out yesterday. It was one of the many flaws with that Border Protection legislation, and it is not a sensible idea now.

 JOURNALIST: Are you having any conversations with the PM about being updated or …?

 BEAZLEY: Not lately. He did indicate that perhaps we would in Question Time. I stayed around last night but I don't think that he is particularly interested in having a chat to me.

 JOURNALIST: A bit over 20 years ago Mick Young and Ian McPhee together put together a bipartisan approach to boat people. Has that, a bit over 20 years, suddenly gone?

 BEAZLEY: Unfortunately you are right, it has. There are many areas where bipartisan policy is desirable so that your argument is around the edges and not at the core, and two of those areas are defence policy and migration. And we have had a bipartisan approach to migration. Unfortunately for the last few years, as you all know in the press gallery after you have watched Question Time from day to day, the effort to keep a bipartisan policy has been pursued by the Labor Party but not by our political opponents. And I think it is time to get back to that.
