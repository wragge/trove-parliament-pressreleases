 PRIME MINISTER

 FOR MEDIA :  .  TUESDAY, 6 JULY 1982

 THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG

 Why does the Labor Party want to cause divisiveness in ; Australia by seeking to change the Australian Flag? Labor is now committed to getting rid of our Flag.

 The Australian Flag was chosen by Australians for Australia.

 Many thousands of men and women have fought and died under it.

 Our Flag stands for the free way of life that Australians  cherish.

 It is a symbol of liberty to refugees and oppressed people  from around the world. ;  ’

 Both main Political Parties have chosen it for their emblem.

 It is a symbol of national unity. In trying to change the  Flag the ALP is again seeking to divide the nation because  there are countless Australians with a passionate belief in  the Flag. Why does Labor have no pride in our Flag?

 What sort of political party is it that cynically drapes the  flag around its conference while it commits a Labor Government  to dumping the same Flag?

 We should look forward to the Bicentenary in 1988 as a year  which marks our desire to work together as one people, a year  to celebrate our achievements as a nation. It should not be  a year marked with the divisiveness that the Labor Party is .  

 now promoting.

 If the ALP thinks that the Flag is inadequate - perhaps that  is a reflection of their own sense of inferiority.

 — oOo—
