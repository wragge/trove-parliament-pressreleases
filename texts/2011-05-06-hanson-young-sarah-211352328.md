 Senator Sarah HansonâYoung   Australian Greens 

 Friday 6 May 2011  

 Gillard govt on track to revive Pacific  Solution: Greens  Confirmation the Gillard government is in talks to reopen a detention centre on Papua New Guinea’s  Manus Island shows it’s reviving the internationally-criticised Pacific Solution, the Australian Greens  said today. 

 “This move, along with the planned return of temporary protection visas, shows the Gillard  government is bringing back more immigration policies of the former Howard government,” Greens  Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “But we all know the Pacific Solution didn’t stop problems such as violence and unrest at detention  centres in its first incarnation, and it won’t stop them this time. 

 “Numerous international bodies including the UNHCR and Oxfam criticised the Manus Island facility  and that on Nauru because people in detention there had no time limits or periodic reviews of their  applications, and they could not access help for their mental illnesses. 

 “The UNHCR refused to process applications on Manus Island, even though PNG is a signatory to the  Refugee Convention. 

 “Australia’s off-shore detention system does not work, should be shut down, and the assessments  performed here on the mainland, so asylum seekers can have access to the essential services they  need,” Sen. Hanson-Young said
