 The Minister for Immigration and.Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee,  stated today that Mr Gheorge Viscreanu has agreed to  voluntarily depart Australia in accordance with an undertaking  previously given that he would abide by any decision made by 

 the.1'Minister regarding his future.

 The Minister said that Mr David.Galbally,  who had been acting  on Mr Viscreanu*s behalf,  had had extensive discussions with  Mr Viscreanu over the weekend and submitted to him earlier  today an appeal against his earlier refusal to grant Mr  Viscreanu* s refugee status.

 The Minister said that he had discussed the matter with  Mr Galbally again today. He said that he had confirmed his  earlier decision that Mr Viscreanu should not remain in  Australia. That decision had been made on the basis of the 

 DORS Committee Report which concluded that Mr Viscreanu had  no well-founded fear of persecution and information received  by him from the Romanian Government that Mr Viscreanu would  not suffer reprisals following his return to Romania.

 The Minister said that the decision was consistent with the  Government's policies that persons admitted to Australia as  visitors and temporary residents, abide by the conditions of  their entry and depart upon the expiration of their authorised  period of stay in Australia.
