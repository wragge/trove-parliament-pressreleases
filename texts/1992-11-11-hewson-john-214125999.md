 Mr Stepan Kerkyashairan, Federal and State Parliamentary colleagues, Dr John  Nieuwenhuysen, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

 In the two years since the previous Immigration Outlook Conference, Australia has  endured the consequences of its worst recession for more than sixty years.

 This reality has changed the lives of millions of Australians.

 It has driven unemployment numbers to record levels.

 It has bankrupted thousands of businesses.

 It has destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Australian families.

 It has undermined confidence in the future and aggravated a range of social problems  in Australia.

 But if there is any positive side at all to this failure of economic policy, it has been that  community attention has turned to the need for structural changes across a whole  range of taxation, labour market, infrastructure and other issues.

 Immigration policy has not been immune from that community debate.

 Long-established practices have needed to be defended.

 The size and composition of the immigration program has been more extensively and  publicly scrutinised.

 These processes have been necessary, desirable and, on the whole, constructive.

 It is very appropriate, therefore, that some of the key research papers presented at  this Conference focus on the correlation between the migration program and the state  of the Australian labour market, and on the net cost impact of the migration program  on Commonwealth, State and Local Governments.

 /

 But the forces of change in the Australian community go well beyond the hardships  inflicted by the recession.

 One of the earliest statements I made after becoming Leader of the Opposition two  and a half years ago was to call for a full and open debate on national issues that for  too long had been mired in political posturing and too easily categorised as  impossible to change.

 My strongly held view then, and even more so now, is that in the worst economic  circumstances for more than sixty years and in a world which is moving inexorably  towards greater and greater economic interdependence, Australia has no choice but  to face up to its very vulnerable situation and to commit itself to a reform agenda that  will restore a competitive economy and rising standards of living.

 In calling for such a debate, I specifically identified immigration policy and the need  for a national debate devoid of arrogance, prejudice and ignorance - a debate in  which myth is clearly differentiated from fact, and emotion from reason. 1

 The National Outlook Conference contributes Importantly to that debate. It has  developed as a significant national forum in which political leaders, administrators,  academic specialists, representative groups and others can raise immigration policy  issues, publicise research, and put their views openly.

 For these reasons I am delighted to be here to put the case directly for the policy  approach which the Federal Opposition has consistently advocated, and to spell out  some aspects of it in greater detail.

 Let me say at the outset that I believe the role which the Coalition Parties have played  over recent years in stimulating and focussing community debate on immigration  policy has been a very effective, responsible and constructive one.

 Our purpose has been very clear.

 We have not fudged what we see as critically important issues about the level of the  migrant intake, the integrity of the administration of Australia's migration program,  settlement arrangements for new migrants, the concept of a multicultural Australia, and  much more.

 We have also sought to go beyond the debate over numbers and to focus on the  rationale for the development of Australia's migration program in the years ahead.

 We have addressed these issues responsibly, on their merits, and in the context of  Australia's current precarious economic circumstances.

 We believe our honest activism has created very real political pressures on the  Government and has had a significant impact on recent changes in the direction of  the Government's immigration policy - particularly in areas such as the provision of  social security benefits, the administration of refugee policy, and the relevance of 

 English language proficiency.

 I want to take the opportunity you have given me today to reiterate the vital core  principles which have underpinned the approach of the Coalition Parties to  immigration policy over the past two and a half years, and which will inspire the policy  direction of a Coalition Government on immigration issues.

 First, the Coalition Parties, whether In Government or Opposition, are committed to  equal treatment and equal opportunity for all Australians regardless of race, colour,  religion or country of origin.

 That commitment is unconditional and it is irreversible.

 Discrimination on the basis of a person's race, colour, religion or country of origin has  no place in Australian life or law. And the policies of a Coalition Government will be  unambiguously committed to that objective - in immigration and in every other aspect  of public policy.

 We have always believed that immigration has been one of the great nation-building  influences in the development of Australia.

 We believe that a well-planned, efficiently administered and non-discrlminatory  immigration program is fundamental to Australia's national economic and social  development and to our international standing.

 One of the great strengths of Australian society is its multicultural character.

 That reality has enriched our country in all aspects of our national life.

 It has also made us a more tolerant and better country.

 In Government and Opposition, the Coalition Parties have had a consistent and deeply  held view that skilled migration, the reunion of Immediate family, and the recognition  of special refugee and other humanitarian claims are all essential elements of an  overall immigration program.

 /

 A second basic perspective on immigration issues is our view that the integrity of  Australia's immigration1  program has been eroded over recent years by the  Government's inefficient administration.

 As a result, we believe that public confidence in the program has been seriously  diminished.

 Over recent years, unrealistic numerical targets for the migration program have been  pursued with greater priority than consistency in migrant entry criteria.

 There has been inadequate and ineffective correlation between the skills of  prospective migrants and the state of the Australian labour market.

 This situation developed largely as a result of the abandonment of the occupational  shares scheme in the points test where emphasis was placed on recruiting for skills  in areas where there were shortages and where employment opportunities existed.

 But the failings of the immigration program over recent years have gone beyond the  balance given to relevant skills.

 The problems afflicting low skill, non-English speaking migrants - problems spelt out  in some of the research papers to be addressed at this Conference - were allowed to  drift for far too long.

 The Migration Regulations remain complex and subject to significant delay.

 The system of assurances of support for extended family members proved ineffective  for too long.

 The administration of the refugee program, with a backlog of 21,700 applications as  of last month, has been a disgrace for too long.

 The abuses of spouse/de facto/fiancee migration arrangements have been too  extensive for too long.

 The old Business Migration Program was subject to inefficiencies and abuse for a long  period of time.

 And the number of illegal migrants - estimated by the Government at 78,000 people  but in our view probably closer to 120,000 - remains a chronic problem.

 The Coalition Parties have focussed consistently on these and other areas of Inefficient  administration in the immigration program.

 /

 We recognise that, in response to political and community pressures, the Government  has moved in some areas to streamline procedures, to limit abuses and to amend  some selection criteria.

 We welcome these reforms.

 But they constitute only the beginning of a long road back from the loopholes and  administrative inefficiencies in the migration program that became entrenched for too  long. '

 They are reforms that are necessary and long overdue.

 But they only begin to address the problems, and the reforms need to be accelerated  and expanded.

 Put simply, a situation was allowed to develop in which Australia's immigration  program lacked both realism and effective controls.

 A major reform process is called for to restore credibility and administrative efficiency.

 A start has been made but the necessary sense of urgency is lacking.

 A Coalition Government will deliver both an effective reform agenda and a sense of  urgency in its implementation.

 A third point of principle for the Coalition Parties in our approach to immigration policy  Is our commitment to put Australia's interests first at the same time as we take proper  account,of our international responsibilities.

 Over the long term, as Australia's economic prospects improve under policies which  the Coalition is now advocating, we firmly believe that an expanding migrant intake will  contribute to our national development.

 One of the great lessons of Australia's post-war history is that, in an expanding  economy, a high level of migration is a major economic and social benefit.

 But we are equally firm in our belief that, in Australia's current economic  circumstances, an immediate and substantial short-term reduction in the number of  migrants coming to Australia is the only responsible course of action.

 In terms of historical experience, the recent size of the migration program represents  a higher intake than in previous recessions of lesser magnitude than the current one.

 In the recession of the early 1960s, for example, the net migration gain fell to between  58,000 and 68,000.

 In the recession of 1982-83, it fell to around 54,000.

 By contrast, the net gain in 1991-92 was more than 78,000 -and that figure still  understates net immigration.

 Unless the Government makes a clear decision on the future status of the Chinese  nationals on four year temporary entry permits, an additional 20,000 migrants and their  dependants could be added to the net outcome.

 We have consistently made it clear that a reduced migrant intake is not, in itself, any  solution to Australia's current economic difficulties.

 Those difficulties will only be overcome by a coherent policy of reform that addresses  Australia's fundamental economic weaknesses.

 It is that objective which underpins the integrated reform agenda set out in Fiahtbackl,

 But, the fact of life is that the current level of migration is not in Australia's interests at  the present time and it is not in the interests of many new migrants themselves.

 In the context of the worst economic circumstances for sixty years, Australia's capacity  to successfully settle large numbers of new migrants is significantly reduced.

 /

 Far too many new migrants to Australia over recent years have arrived with high  hopes, only to be disillusioned by long periods of unemployment or in receipt of social  security benefits.

 In July this year, the Liberal Party’s National Convention became a Jobs Forum, an  attempt to assess at first hand the economic and social consequences of the  recession and to clearly identify what needs to be done.

 One very powerful statement at our Jobs Forum came from Mohan Amuradha, a  highly qualified civil engineer with extensive practical experience in India who  emigrated to Australia last year.

 Mr Amuradha told our Jobs Forum how he resigned his job in India and how he was  told by officials that jobs were available for him in Australia.

 He went qn to tell of his life on the dole In Australia, how he felt "almost humiliated" in  receiving government benefits that he described as "a sophisticated style of begging"  which he and his family found "demoralising".

 The story of Mohan Amuradha is the story of far too many disillusioned migrants to  Australia over recent years.

 It is the story, in particular, of newly arrived migrants among whom unemployment  rates have averaged 35% since 1991, compared with a 1986-1990 average of 15%.

 In the case of some national groups, the unemployment rate over the past year has  been as high as 70%.

 In this context, it is also relevant to note the paper prepared for this Conference by  Robert Ackland and Lynne Williams on Immigrants and the Australian Labour Market:  the Experience of Three Recessions.

 They produce some compelling evidence in support of their conclusion that, in  recessions such as the current one, immigrants to Australia from non English-speaking  backgrounds suffer higher job loss and relatively higher increases in unemployment  rates than other immigrants from English-speaking backgrounds, and higher than  those born in Australia.

 The study also shows how immigrants, and particularly those from non English­ speaking backgrounds, are relatively disadvantaged during the recovery phase of a  recession.

 In Australia's current economic circumstances, it is also true that the migrants whom  Australia most needs - migrants who are younger, better educated, English-speaking,  more highly and more relevantly skilled, and more employable - are applying in  significantly reduced numbers to come to Australia.

 In these circumstances, the Coalition Parties have made it clear that we are not  prepared to compromise migrant entry criteria just to meet fixed numerical targets.

 By contrast, what we have done over the past two and a half years is to set down a  detailed set of reforms which we believe are desirable and necessary in their own  right, and which will have the effect of dramatically reducing the migrant intake until  the Australian economy can properly accommodate a significant increase in numbers.

 We have called for more effective labour market testing of prospective migrants in  relation to the points system to ensure not only a higher proportion of skilled migrants,  but also a higher proportion of migrants with skills relevant to Australia's current and  future labour market requirements. .

 We have called for greater weight to be given to English language proficiency  including among migrants in the concessional family reunion category - a call which  the Government has now taken up.

 We have called for tougher bona tides testing in the preferential family reunion  category, and particularly in the spouse/de facto/fiancee entry which currently  constitutes about 30% of the total migrant intake.

 In that context, we have called for spouses married overseas to be subject to the  same requirements as those which now apply to on-shore applicants - namely, a two  year provisional migrant status and stricter requirements for de factos in terms of  longer co-domicile arrangements.

 We have called for social security benefits not to be extended to future migrants  during their first two years in Australia (except those with refugee or humanitarian entry  status or those in exceptional circumstances) - a call to which the Government has  responded with a similar exemption, but only for a six month period.

 We have called for all applications for refugee or humanitarian entry to be determined  on a case-by-case basis, including the approximately 20,000 Chinese students to  whom the Australian Government has granted de facto permanent residence.

 In making these and other calls for reform, the Coalition Parties have consistently and  deliberately refrained from setting fixed targets for our first year in government.

 And we will not be getting into the business from Opposition of setting fixed targets  to be implemented in Government.

 But we believe that our reforms will have an immediate and dramatic short-term impact  in reducing the overall size of the migration program.

 Furthermore, a Coalition Government will not significantly increase the migrant intake  until there are clear signs - including a significant and sustained improvement in  unemployment and other indicators such as foreign debt - to demonstrate that the  Australian economy is expanding in a sustainable way which can effectively  accommodate an Increased level of migration.

 In this context, I have noted that this Conference will be considering a Research Paper  by Mr Will Foster titled Macroeconomic Effects of Change in the Size and Composition  of Australia's Migrant Intake.

 I do not wish to endorse the accuracy of Mr Foster's scenarios for the future of the  migratloh program, nor in particular the scenario he attributes to the Coalition Parties.  Nor do I wish to endoVse some of the general conclusions which the paper puts  forward.

 But it is relevant to note some of the outcomes which Mr Foster's data produces in  terms of the favourable correlation between a lower migrant intake and the short and  long-term effects on unemployment, foreign debt, exports, imports, and GDP.

 And I look forward to learning of the assessment which participants in this Conference  make of such data.

 A fourth principle which a Coalition Government will bring to immigration policy relates  to refugee and humanitarian entry.

 We have made it clear that the refugee/humanitarian component of the migration  program, with its humanitarian purposes, should be considered as distinct from the  rest of the migration program, with its essentially economic and social purposes.

 The Coalition Parties have a proud record in this area which we will continue to  uphold.

 In particular, we will continue to fulfil our responsibilities under United Nations and  other international agreements.

 We have been very concerned, however, about the delays in processing of refugee  applications and the widespread inefficiencies in the refugee determination system.

 We believe that a case-by-case assessment of sll refugee applications is the only  genuinely fair and compassionate means of addressing the issue.

 The backlog of over 20,000 cases has seriously undermined Australia's capacity to  assist genuine refugees in a timely and consistent manner.

 Accordingly, we have called for a number of corrective measures including  redeploying staff and resources to the refugee determination system, requiring leave  before further appeal of contested applications is permitted', limiting the scope for  appeals, and ensuring that applications are processed expeditiously and fairly.

 The Government is gradually adopting some of these measures but there is a need  for urgent and co-ordinated action to restore Australia's credibility in this area.

 An important test case of the Governments's new-found resolve in reforming the  refugee determination system will be its response to the recent report of the Joint  Standing Committee ori Migration Regulations.

 A bipartisan majority of the Committee supported an overturning of the current  discriminatory policy in favour of Chinese nationals who were in Australia prior to the  Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

 The majority report recommended in favour of a case-by-case assessment of all  applications for refugee and humanitarian status.

 The Coalition Parties have always opposed the special "permanent temporary" status  created for those Chinese nationals in 1990 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke -  a policy later endorsed by the current Prime Minister, Mr Keating.

 Like all other applicants for refugee or humanitarian status, those Chinese nationals  in Australia with a genuine fear of persecution should be provided with appropriate  protection.

 But the provision of blanket protection, irrespective of individual ciaims, is  discriminatory and unfair to other applicants.

 The Prime Minister needs to respond to the Joint Committee report as a matter of  urgency. He needs to do so to end the current uncertainty.

 But more generally, he needs to do so in order to restore non-discriminatory criteria  as the basis of a consistent and principled Australian refugee policy.

 A fifth principle of the Coalition's approach to immigration policy concerns the new  priority'we wish to give to the relevance and significance of Australian citizenship.

 The present law - the 1948 Citizenship Act - is deficient in that it contains no clear  statement of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.

 We want to encourage all Australians in a positive way to become citizens by making  citizenship more relevant and more easily understood.

 We are about specifying and reaffirming rights, not diminishing them.

 We are about raising the profile and significance of citizenship.

 We believe that the residency requirement before a grant of citizenship is possible  should be extended from a period of two years to four years. Such a period would  serve to place an appropriate premium on the privilege of citizenship.

 We also believe that a basic competence in English should be a requirement for all  grants of citizenship except for aged people over 60.

 We believe that the entitlement to sponsor immigrants should be limited to Australian  citizens, except in cases where those being sponsored are in the preferential category  or have refugee/humanitarian status.

 We believe that citizenship classes prior to the grant of citizenship could focus on the  key facts of Australia's history, the symbolism and relevance of our flag, the words of  the National Anthem, and the rights and obligations of being an Australian citizen.

 We believe that the scope for dual citizenship should be extended.

 We also believe there is much to recommend the proposal put forward by the  Fitzgerald Report that at citizenship ceremonies new citizens should make a  declaration to respect fundamental institutions and principles of Australian society.

 The declaration could reaffirm an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia.

 It could specify that the right to express one's own culture and beliefs involves a  reciprocal responsibility to accept the right of others to express their views and values.

 It could also signify respect and acceptance of the principle of non-discrimination on  the basis of race, colour, religion, or national or ethnic origin.

 All these Initiatives could usefully serve the objective of making citizenship a more  significant and meaningful symbol in Australia's national way of life.

 Finally, I wish to refer briefly to a sixth principle underpinning the Coalition's approach  to immigration policy generally and to multicultural policies in particular.

 The Coalition Parties remain firmly committed to a multicultural Australia. We  recognise the historic scale of the contribution which migrants have made, and  continue to make, to the development of Australia's economic, cultural and social life.

 We support the right of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural  heritage. We support the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and  opportunity. And we are committed to maintaining, developing and utilising effectively  the skills and talents of all Australians.

 We recognise the aspirations of migrant families to participate fully in Australia's  national life.  J

 We will provide a range of incentives and support for them through the policies and  initiatives outlined in Fiqhtbacki.

 Within the context of an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, the Coalition  Parties are also committed to programs that will strengthen a multicultural society.

 That is why we are committed to maintaining a full range of settlement services for  new migrants, developing the Ethnic Schools Program, encouraging proficiency in  E-nglish, supporting community-based schools, facilitating second language skills,  ensuring that prompt recognition is given to overseas qualifications which equate with  Australian standards, and working to give migrant women, migrant families and aged  migrants more genuine equality of opportunity.

 What we oppose, however, is the attempt by governments, such as the Federal Labor  Government over recent years, to use the label of "multiculturalism" as a means of  secretly allocating money during the lead-up to an election, as happened prior to the  1990 Federal election, in the hope of winning particular votes in particular marginal  seats.

 We condemn that approach, which politicises multicultural programs, as the politics  of division - and we will continue to reject it. And I am sure that most migrants would  similarly reject the demeaning notion that their vote could be bought in such an  opportunistic way.

 We have always been committed to strengthening the real foundations of a  multicultural Australia - and we will continue to be committed to that objective.

 In conclusion, tfiay I wish the Conference well in its deliberations.

 It is taking place at a time of great community interest and involvement in the  immigration program. And it has the potential to make an Informed and highly  constructive contribution.

 I know that all of you who will be participating in the Conference recognise that  responsibility, and I wish you every success in fulfilling it.
