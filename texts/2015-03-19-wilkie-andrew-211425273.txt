 UN ADDS WEIGHT TO CASE AGAINST GOVERNMENT AT THE HAGUE   

 

 The Independent Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, and eminent human rights lawyer  Greg Barns will be available to discuss the most recent correspondence with the  International Criminal Court in regard to Australia’s non-compliance with the Rome  Statute and crimes against humanity against asylum seekers.    

 Mr Wilkie will be available to comment in Canberra  WHEN: 10am Today Thursday 19 March  WHERE: Senate Courtyard, Parliament House Canberra    

 Mr Barns will be available by phone on 0419 691 846    

 In essence Mr Wilkie, in cooperation with Mr Barns, has drawn the Prosecutor’s attention  to the damning findings in this month’s United Nations Report of the Special Rapporteur,  Juan MÃ©ndez, on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.   He has also highlighted that the Prime Minster and his Cabinet have also repeatedly  rejected the findings by the UN Human Rights Committee that the continued detention of  refugees subject to adverse security assessments constitutes arbitrary detention.    

 Extracts of Mr Wilkie’s letter    

 ``I wish to draw your attention to the findings contained in the United Nations Report of  the Special Rapporteur, Juan MÃ©ndez, on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading  treatment or punishment. The Report was released in Geneva by the Human Rights  Council on 6 March 2015.    

 ``In particular I respectfully draw the attention of the Office of the Prosecutor to the  conclusions of the Special Rapporteur about the ongoing detention of 203 Sri Lankan  asylum seekers and their incommunicado detention. I also note the Special Rapporteur’s  conclusions about the impact of legislation drafted and introduced in the Australian  Parliament by the members of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The Migration  and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) 

 Bill 2014 and the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Bill  2014 are now Australian law.    

 ``The Special Rapporteur concludes that the above legislation violates the rights of a  group of persons, namely asylum seekers and migrants, to be free from torture and cruel,  inhuman or degrading treatment.    

 ``I would also like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the Prime Minister’s  response to this Report. In a public statement he said that “Australians are sick of being  lectured by the United Nations, particularly given that we have stopped the boats and by  stopping the boats we have ended the deaths at sea”. 

 

 ``It is respectfully submitted that the Prime Minister’s comments in relation to the Report  indicate a state of mind that is, at the very least, reckless as to whether or not breaches of  the Rome Statute are occurring as a consequence of his and the Cabinet’s policies. The  issue of intent is of course one for your office.    

 ``The Prime Minster and his Cabinet have also repeatedly rejected the findings by the  United Nations Human Rights Committee that the continued detention of refugees  subject to adverse security assessments constitutes arbitrary detention.    

 ``For instance recently their government failed to comply with, and missed by almost a  year the 180-day deadline to respond, the Committee’s July 2013 ruling regarding more  than 30 recognised refugees. These people were subject to indefinite detention without  trial and the Committee recommended they be released and compensated.’’    

 Background    

 In October last year Mr Wilkie, in cooperation with Mr Barns, requested the Prosecutor at  the ICC initiate an investigation in accordance with Article 15(1) of the Rome Statute.    

 Article 7 of the Rome Statute defines ‘crimes against humanity’ to mean acts such as  deportation, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty in violation of  fundamental rules of international law, and torture and other similar acts that are  committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian  population.  Actions such as forced transfers to other countries, detention without trial,  detention of children and conditions of detention clearly constitute breaches of Article 7.    

 ``The actions of the Prime Minister and members of his Government against asylum  seekers are criminal,’’ Mr Wilkie said.  Last month, Mr Wilkie provided the Prosecutor with a comprehensive brief on this  matter.  The Office of the Prosecutor has replied that it is analysing the situation to decide  if there is reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation.  A copy of the letter is attached.
