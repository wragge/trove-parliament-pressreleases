 The Prime Minister must show some leadership and take the venom out of the debate on asylum seekers, 

 according to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.  

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson for Immigration and Human Rights, says both Kevin Rudd and 

 Malcolm Turnbull are doing themselves and the public a disservice by continuing to refer to asylum seekers as 

 "illegal''. 

 People who are fleeing persecution have every right to seek asylum under international law, and the Press Council 

 has warned that the use of the words "illegal" or "illegals" in coverage of the issue is inaccurate.  

 "As a career diplomat, Mr Rudd knows very well the importance of the words he uses,'' Senator Hanson-Young 

 said.  

 "He also knows there is only one reason to use this sort of language - to deliberately inflame public debate.'' 

 "Unfortunately we have come to expect this sort of language from the Coalition, but the Prime Minister's rhetoric 

 on this issue come as an unwelcome shock - even his own caucus is beginning to raise concerns.'' 

 The Greens welcome the fact that Indonesia has agreed to allow the 78 asylum seekers on board the Oceanic 

 Viking to come to their shores, but this does not mean Au stralia can wash its hands of the issue and say the 

 problem is solved.  

 "People are not going to stop fleeing from conflict in Sri Lanka,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "Hazaras are still being persecuted in Afghanistan. The movement of asylum seekers around the world will 

 continue, there will be more boats, and Australia has to accept that it will have to be part of the answer to this 

 problem. 

 "We call on the Prime Minister to abandon his inflammatory rhetoric, to calm down and take a more measured 

 approach.  

 "He should start by convincing our neighbours in Indonesia and Malaysia to sign the UN Refugee Convention, and 

 by refusing to give credence to the myth that Australia has no role to play in processing asylum seekers and 

 resettling refugees.''
