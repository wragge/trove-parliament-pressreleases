 TRANSCRIPT 

  Jenny Macklin MP  Deputy Federal Labor Leader  Shadow Minister for Education, Training,   Science & Research  Federal Member for Jagajaga   

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - CANBERRA  22/06/05   E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: National Party’s position on VSU; Western Australian universities  merger; immigration and detention centre issues      

 JENNY MACKLIN:  There are two major stories that I want to talk about this  morning.  One, on the front page of the SMH.  A number of National Party  Members and Senators are indicating that they do not agree with the 

 Government’s proposal to do away with student organisations in our universities.  So we look forward to National Party Members and Senators supporting Labor to  make sure that all the current services that exist on our university campuses will  continue because we know that if student organisations disappear, all of those  critical services will also go.  We’ll lose sporting facilities, we’ll lose health  services, we’ll lose cultural facilities if we don’t have student organisations  making sure that they are funded. So I certainly look forward to the support of  National Party Members and Senators when these matters are debated in the  House and in the Senate in the coming months.  I certainly hope Brendan Nelson  will listen to them and come to his senses.   

 The second major issue I want to talk about this morning is the front page of the  Australian where they are talking about the possible merger of three universities  in Western Australia, all because of the Howard Government’s major changes to  our universities and the lack of funding to those universities.  We’ll see fewer and  fewer universities if the impact of these changes continues. If the Howard  Government continues to not properly fund our universities, then this proposal in  WA can expect to spread to other parts of the country. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  What’s the problem with the merger… [INAUDIBLE]?   

 JENNY MACKLIN:  The real problem is that we’ll have fewer universities  offering fewer courses.  We won’t have the sort of diversity that Brendan Nelson  and others say is necessary for the future of our country.  We want to make sure  that we have as many different courses available to students in different parts of 

 the country.  What the universities are saying is that that’s just not possible  because the Howard Government will not properly fund our universities.     

 JOURNALIST:  It’s been argued in Perth though for some time that the city  has got one and a quarter million people and five universities… [INAUDIBLE]?   

 JENNY MACKLIN:  The important thing is that we encourage as many Western  Australian students as possible to go to university.  Western Australia historically  has not had its fair share of university places.  That’s the real issue.  Let’s make  sure that they get the extra places that Western Australia needs and encourage  students that want to go to university to do so, not see forced mergers of  universities all because the Howard Government won’t properly fund universities.   

 JOURNALIST:  Can you explain the logic between  …[INAUDIBLE]…arguing for amendments on the Government’s immigration law  changes in the HR but when they get to the Senate they are not deemed worthy  enough to pursue to their finale?   

 JENNY MACKLIN:  Well the important thing is to recognise that there are some  small improvements in what the Government’s putting forward. We don’t want to,  in the end, jeopardise the small improvements. We want to indicate that we have  other changes we’d like to see made. That’s why we’ll be moving those  amendments first. But in the end we won’t stand in the way of the small  improvements that the Government's putting forward.   

 JOURNALIST:  It’s been described as a mish-mash approach.  Senator  Robert Ray said that it was devised by a bunch of dills on the frontbench.   

 JENNY MACKLIN:  When you get to the issues, we’ll be moving amendments  to make sure, for example, that children are removed from detention centres.  I  certainly hope when that amendment is moved in the House today, the Liberal  moderates will come over and support Labor’s amendments because our  amendments will actually strengthen the position that has been put forward in the  Government’s legislation. So let's get down to the real issues which are making  sure we have a more humane immigration policy.   

 JOURNALIST:  What do you think of Laurie Ferguson’s performance as  Shadow Immigration Minister?   

 JENNY MACKLIN:  Look I think he’s been doing a very good job in very difficult  circumstances.  You’ve had a very divided Liberal Party room and we only got  the legislation yesterday, after we had our Caucus meeting.  I think the important  thing now is to concentrate on the issues and concentrate on getting children out  of detention centres and making sure that we can in fact have a more humane  system.   

 JOURNALIST:  If you are a media adviser, would you tell him that a bloke  who’s been in detention seven years probably shouldn’t…[INAUDIBLE]… he’s  come out and said that it’s a worrying precedent to release this bloke who’s been 

 in detention for seven years, and he's your Immigration spokesperson?   

 JENNY MACKLIN:  I don’t think there’s any doubt that seven years is too long.  That’s certainly my view on that matter.  But the important thing now is to look at  the amendments that we’re going to move in the House today, and I certainly  hope we can look forward to the support of some of the Liberal moderates.
