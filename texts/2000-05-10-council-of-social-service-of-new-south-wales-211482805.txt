 The budget of lost opportunities 10 May 2000

 In its first response, the Council of Social Service of NSW (NCOSS) has labelled Peter Costello’s 5th Federal Budget as one of muddled spending priorities and fragile economic assumptions.

 “Besides some welcome rural health initiatives, the Federal Budget is one of lost opportunities to assist struggling families and disadvantaged communities across NSW,” said NCOSS Director, Gary Moore.

 “Housing related poverty, and the massive reduction in housing affordability for low and modest income people, is a key issue in Greater Sydney, which this Budget totally ignores.”

 “The 5.75% post GST inflation rate, when combined with GST hikes attached to public transport fares, road tolls and energy bills, savagely penalises several hundred thousand NSW households.”

 “Commonwealth legal aid for family law, immigration and other civil matters, will be further rolled back in 2000/2001 in NSW with no extra Budget support.

 “And, in NSW, where 40% of the nation’s migrants settle, the Budget’s new and very punitive measures for migrants, including forcing immediately arrived refugees to seek up to 20 jobs each week to qualify for special benefit payments, are highly questionable.”

 “Whilst additional child care for shift workers and isolated rural families is important, the Budget does nothing to narrow the massive gap, especially apparent in parts of Sydney and regional NSW cities, between child care fees and what the majority of families can afford to pay.”

 “The nature of the increases in family assistance payments, when combined with the structure of the 1 July tax cuts, reinforce the growing income inequality prevalent in the community, especially between parts of Sydney itself and between Sydney and parts of rural NSW.”

 “The Howard Government should not be extending its idea of mutual obligation and further penalising the unemployed through greater pressures on Centrelink, and more powers to cut benefits, before its own Welfare Reform Reference Group has submitted its final report.”

 “Ironically, such measures may do more harm to unemployed people in rural communities where unemployment rates are 2-3 times the national average.”

 “And, once again, the Commonwealth Government has failed to target business development and employment creation assistance to these rural areas, and other parts of Sydney, where job opportunities are next to non existent.”

 “NCOSS hopes that the Budget’s bigger fiscal incentives for doctors to train and practice in rural NSW are achievable and will complement recently announced NSW Government initiatives for rural health.”

 “The additional rural aged care spending must be better managed than previous efforts, to reduce the massive clogging of rural NSW hospitals with older people under inappropriate care.”

 “The Budget’s fragile economic assumptions are highlighted by the Government’s scrapping of the Timor tax and its windfall revenue projections from the one-off sale of mobile phone spectrums.”

 “In NSW, the State’s 1 million low income people, desperately need the Howard Government’s long awaited social dividend. After six years of strong economic growth, this Budget wasted this rare opportunity.”

 “We also worry that, if the national economy slows significantly, this Budget’s legacy will be a deficit, which will be code for significant spending cuts in the future,” added Mr Moore.
