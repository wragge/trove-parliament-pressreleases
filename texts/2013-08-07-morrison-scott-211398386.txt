 JOINT PRESS RELEASE 

 THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. SCOTT MORRISON MHR, SHADOW MINISTER FOR  IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 

 KEVIN RUDD’S 50,000 ILLEGAL ARRIVALS BY BOAT   

 The interception of the latest boat carrying 67 passengers means that over 50,000 people have now arrived  illegally by boat since Mr Rudd dismantled our border security policies.   

 This is a terrible milestone.   

 50,032 people on 798 boats have arrived under Mr Rudd’s failed policies, including over 1,900 who have  arrived since Mr Rudd launched his ‘PNG solution’.     

 This will be forever remembered as one of Mr Rudd’s worst decisions.   

 It has cost over 1,000 lives.   

 It has also resulted in over $11 billion in Budget blowouts.   

 It has damaged Australia’s international reputation and weakened our borders.   

 The Coalition has a clear, consistent plan to stop the boats.     

 Mr Rudd is just talk and has neither the will nor the competence to secure our borders.   

 The Coalition’s policy for stronger borders will:    

 â¢           Re-establish rigorous and expanded offshore processing for illegal arrivals;  â¢           Give orders to the Navy and Customs Service to turn back boats where safe to do so;  â¢           Re-introduce Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) for asylum seekers found to be genuine refugees,  and return them home when it is safe;  â¢           Deny those asylum seekers who deliberately discard identification documentation the benefit of the  doubt when determining their refugee status;  â¢           Work with our neighbours to stop people smugglers and deter their customers from coming into the  region; and  â¢           Guarantee places for offshore humanitarian visa applicants by denying permanent visas to illegal  boat arrivals.   

 If elected, the Coalition will also initiate Operation Sovereign Borders to be led by a senior military  commander of 3 star ranking.  Within the first one hundred days of a new government, Operation Sovereign  Borders will establish a joint agency taskforce; finalise and issue protocols for Operation Relex II, to turn  back boats where it is safe to do so; increase capacity at offshore processing centres; and lease and deploy  additional vessels to relieve patrol vessels of passenger transfers.

 Our message to all Australians is that the Coalition has a detailed plan to stop the boats.   We will make a  difference from day one.   

 At this election there is a choice: between the Coalition’s proven plan that will stop the boats, or a  continuation of Labor’s record of failure and misery.
