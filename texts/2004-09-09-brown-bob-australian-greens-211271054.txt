 A warm-hearted Australia 

 Senator Bob Brown, Australian Greens 

 National Press Club, 8 September 2004 

 

 Greetings 

 

 It is springtime.  The Prime Minister has called an election.  So on October 9, let’s 

 have a good spring clean up there on Capitol Hill which can do with a batch of 

 fresh new faces:  warm-hearted Greens working for the whole nation’s wellbeing 

 and not just that of the stock exchange. 

 

 And as summer approaches, let us in the sunny country, in a world urgently 

 challenged by global warming, capitalise on the sun’s energy.  The Greens will 

 work to foster Australia’s marvellous renewable energy expertise, to create 

 thousands of new jobs, manufacturing solar-derived power technology to use here 

 as well as export to the Asia Pacific region and the rest of the world. 

 

 I love this country, Australia.  I am honoured to be an elected representative of the 

 Tasmanian people but also to be working for the future of all Australians.  I have a 

 splendid working relationship with my friends and fellow Greens Senator Kerry 

 Nettle from New South Wales, and with Michael Organ, who has proved such a 

 breath of fresh air and excellent local representative for the people of Wollongong 

 in his seat of Cunningham. 

 

 When I first spoke as Senator at the Press Club in 1997, we had barely 700 

 members.  Now we have 8000, and are growing fast.  While the new support is 

 from across the age spectrum, it is particularly vigorous amongst young voters. 

 

  1

 The Taverner poll released last Sunday showed that when young Australians are 

 asked which party cares most for them, the Greens even outpolled the government. 

 

 That reflects the oceanic differences between the old parties, with their sights set 

 on winning the next election, and the Greens’ long-sighted question which 

 predicates all our decision-making:  ‘Will people 100 years from now thank us for 

 doing this?’  If we can’t answer ‘yes’ to that question you should not proceed - 

 you have to find a better policy which is OK for the next generation. 

 

 The stoush over Tasmania’s iconic forests and wildlife is a case in point.  Liberal 

 and Labor have racked up the greatest rate of destruction ever in those forests - 

 though with no commensurate increase in jobs.  This year, 150 000 log trucks will 

 take the forests to the woodchip mills and so to the paper mills of Japan, China 

 and Korea.  Yet Tasmanians, who provide the wood, get less than 1 percent of the 

 end price for that paper.  It is a ruinous one-off loss of a priceless national asset to 

 cash-up a greedy few men now. 

 

 85 percent of people want federal intervention to save Tasmania's forests.  This 

 tide of Australian public opinion has moved both the Prime Minister and Leader of 

 the Opposition to flag forest-saving packages - to be announced in coming weeks 

 - which it is hoped will protect the high conservation value forests like the Styx 

 Valley of the Giants, the Tarkine rainforests, the Weld and Huon forests and the 

 beautiful Blue Tier in north-east Tasmania near St Helens.  These packages can 

 and should increase jobs by having the timber processed in Tasmania instead of 

 overseas.  The biggest impediment to such a win-win outcome is Gunns Pty Ltd, 

 the world’s biggest hardwood woodchipper.  Its CEO John Gay was asked by 

 Channel 9’s Graham Davis in February 2003 about the agony of native animals as 

 Tasmania’s forests are logged, burned and poisoned. 

 

  2

 GRAHAM DAVIS:  How do you feel about protected species 

 dying for your business?  

 

 JOHN GAY: Well, there's too many of them and we need to 

 keep them at a reasonable level.  

 

 GRAHAM DAVIS: You're saying there's too many wombats 

 and ring-tailed possums?  

 

 JOHN GAY: Yes, most certainly.  

 

 GRAHAM DAVIS: Why are they protected then? Why are 

 they classed as endangered?  

 

 JOHN GAY: Well, because the numbers are getting too great 

 and the ring-tailed possum is a very small proportion of 

 this. It's usually the brush possums that are poisoned, not 

 ring-tails.  

 

 GRAHAM DAVIS: Well, how can you say that, though, when 

 you concede that this thing kills everything?  

 

 JOHN GAY: Well, everything that goes there to eat, but I 

 believe it is an acceptable practice.  

  3

 GRAHAM DAVIS: It is acceptable practice to knock off all the 

 wildlife in the surrounding areas, so that you can put your 

 tree seedlings in?  

 

 JOHN GAY: Yes. 

 

 This year 200 000 people are visiting Strahan to see the wild river wilderness 

 which, 21 years ago, was the centre of the furore over the dam.  As with the saving 

 of the Franklin, and the end of logging in the Daintree World Heritage rainforests 

 17 years ago, saving Tasmania’s grand forests will prove to be a job winner and a 

 future economic mainstay for nearby towns and businesses. 

 

 So, this week, many Australians - including Liberals and Labor voters are holding 

 our breaths for the Coalition and Labor packages for saving Tasmania’s forests. 

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, there are too many young Australians missing out on 

 tertiary education because either the HECS fees will put a debt cloud over their 

 young adult life or because non-HECS courses cost too much - they are only for 

 the rich. 

 

 The Greens see tertiary education, be it through TAFE, university or 

 apprenticeship, as a right.  These days tertiary learning is as important a right for 

 everyone as primary and secondary education.  Yet the HECS impediment, 

 invented by Labor and raised by the Liberals, turns thousands from going from 

 secondary to tertiary education every year.  HECS cuts right across the idea of a 

 clever county with everyone skilled up to contribute her or his best to Australia’s 

 future. 

 

  4

 Less than half the Costello $14.7 billion tax cuts for the rich, which were 

 supported by Labor, would set young Australians free of the yoke of the HECS 

 fees. The Greens would have redirected some of that tax cut to abolish HECS. 

 

 By the way, Labor last week announced a policy to help schools cope with 

 difficult youngsters.  We think the burden on teachers should be spread more 

 fairly.  Schools receiving federal funding should need to assure the government 

 that they will keep their share of such children.  It is not acceptable for wealthier 

 private schools to expel troubled pupils over to the public school system. 

 

 The Greens want federal funding for the public education system to be lifted by at 

 least $1 billion per annum to bring spending in line with world’s best practice, as 

 in Scandinavia. 

 

 We would raise corporate taxation from 30% back to 33%. That is still below 

 2001, when it was 34%. We would use the additional revenue to fund employment 

 creation, in particular for people who have been out of work for 12 months or 

 longer and for young people. While the government claims that official 

 unemployment is at historically low levels, under-employment and unemployment 

 are much higher. The real figure of joblessness is probably double the official rate.  

 

 The extent of casual and part-time work is expanding, now approaching half of all 

 jobs. This kind of employment may suit some people but many want more hours 

 of work and casual workers want and deserve the security and conditions that 

 others take for granted, like sick leave and holiday leave.  

  5

 Labor talks about incentives to encourage people to move from income support to 

 paid work but we must generate the work, and it must be decently paid with fair 

 conditions. Around 15% of people living below the poverty line have wages as 

 their principal household income. This is unacceptable in a country as wealthy as 

 Australia. And we must not penalise those who cannot find work. The Greens will 

 continue to speak out against the punitive breaching regime, which fines people 

 relying on income support, and against government moves to reduce income 

 support for people with a disability. 

 

 Investing our national wealth in public health is also a priority for the Greens. 

 Everyone, including those in rural and regional Australia, should have a bulk-billing doctor nearby, as well as access to a well-funded and staffed public 

 hospital and aged care services. 

 

 When Labor did its Senate backflip and supported the Howard government’s hike 

 of $4.90 for family prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme this 

 year, the Greens stood firm.  Labor’s  $1.1 billion saving here was to help fund its 

 election campaign tax cuts announced yesterday.  Labor, like the Liberals, has put 

 health care second to tax cuts.  As a result, up to five million prescriptions will not 

 be filled for Australians in the coming year. 

 

 The Greens would progressively bring dental care into Medicare. We must address 

 the inadequately funded government programmes for low-income earners that 

 leave people waiting years for basic dental treatment, just as we must address the 

 fact that many Australians never see a dentist from year to year - it is a luxury 

 they cannot afford yet preventative dental care will provide savings to the health 

 budget in the long-run.  

 

  6

 The government spends $2.5 billion per annum propping up its two-tiered health 

 policy through the private health insurance rebate.  It has just proposed increasing 

 this by almost half a million dollars over four years. The Greens would put the 

 funds directly into hospitals, preventative health care, incentives for GPs to bulk 

 bill, mental health services, Indigenous health, and community education and 

 support services to help keep people out of hospitals or other institutions. This is a 

 more responsible use of public funds than the private health insurance rebate. 

 

 Around 170 000 Australians are diagnosed with dementia and possibly as many 

 again suffer early dementia.  By 2040 the number may reach half a million.  The 

 cost is already over $3 billion per annum but better resourcing is a federal 

 responsibility.  Dementia should be a national health priority, with government 

 backing more research, early diagnosis and flexible community and respite care, 

 as well as improved funding for dementia-specific residential care. 

 

 One of the poorest moments in recent Senate debate was when Labor supported 

 the Howard government’s bill to discriminate against same-sex couples marrying 

 in Australia, as they can in Canada.  What possessed Labor?  The Senate inquiry 

 to allow community input would have delayed this decision until after the election.  

 But with Labor’s support, the Howard government’s bigoted instinct became law 

 across Australia just as President Bush, whose thinking had triggered Mr 

 Howard’s bill, backed down from similar discriminatory federal law in the USA. 

 

 Labor has done a little better with refugees, promising to bring the children in the 

 camps out from behind the razor wire.  We Greens would also integrate the 

 mothers and fathers into the Australian community while, of course, sending non-refugees home. 

 

  7

 If you looked for the Liberal’s policies on their website at the start of this 

 campaign, you would have found that, unlike the Greens’ 170 page policy 

 platform, Mr Howard’s party shad  no policies;  just 24 pages of motherhood and 

 generalisations.   

 

 One point stood out.  Under foreign and trade policy, a priority for Mr Howard 

 was to ‘provide international aid and assistance, including a safe haven for 

 refugees, within the limits of our national resources’.  That sounds like good 

 policy if, by a ‘safe haven’, John Howard means Australia. If only he’d implement 

 this promise. 

 

 Where John Howard and I also agree is in the importance of Australia’s friendship 

 with America. However, the approach is different.  Last October, the Prime 

 Minister sidelined our head of state, Governor General Jeffrey, by making 

 President Bush’s visit to the parliament in Canberra non-official.  Mr Howard had 

 no compunction in relegating Australia’s highest institutions to the convenience of 

 the White House and himself. 

 

 That the Australian people were excluded from their parliament house, and their 

 elected representatives gagged for President Bush and, the next day, China’s 

 President Hu, highlighted the Howard government’s relegation of parliament as 

 the powerhouse of the people. 

 

 The Greens' call to President Bush in parliament, to return the two Australians 

 David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib to Australia for trial, was not just an appeal for 

 fairness; it was also an assertion of our parliament’s central role in Australian 

 democracy. 

 

  8

 I called on President Bush to respect Australia and also to respect international 

 law.  Senator Nettle voiced the concern of many Australians about the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. 

 

 That call for due trial process for the Guantanamo Bay prisoners has since been 

 taken up by the opposition and, this week, even the government.  However, with 

 Labor backing, the Free Trade Agreement awaits only an exchange of letters 

 between President Bush and Prime Minister Howard (or Prime Minister Latham!), 

 and it will bind Australia for ever. 

 

 It is a bad deal for Australia.  It threatens thousands of Australian jobs and blocks 

 major Australian exports to the US like sugar, cheap pharmaceuticals and fast 

 ferries, while opening Australia to all US manufactured goods regardless. 

 

 However, it is the undermining of Australian sovereignty which may prove the 

 worst aspect.  The Coalition and Labor have agreed with the Bush administration 

 to set up a powerful faceless presidium called the Joint Committee.  This 

 Committee will oversee the functioning of the Agreement, including dispute 

 arbitration when, for example, US corporations challenge Australia for breaching 

 the FTA.  The challenge might be against Australia’s tough quarantine laws or a 

 future parliamentary bill increasing local content on Australian TV, or a state 

 government decision to favour Australian companies in contracts to build schools 

 or police stations. 

 

 The Joint Committee and seven other faceless committees will interpret the big 

 number of ‘constructive ambiguities’ - that is undefined clauses - in the FTA.  

 They, not parliament, will make the regulations.  Parliament has no say.  There is 

 no appeal to Australia’s courts. 

 

  9

 This unelected joint committee (with its sub-committees) can either insist that 

 Australia reverse a law which the US has successfully challenged, or it can impose 

 a penalty so that Australian taxpayers will compensate the corporation.  The 

 Australian parliament is left sidelined and helpless. 

 

 When the Greens moved in the Senate to insist decisions by this committee must 

 be validated by our parliament, Latham Labor crossed the floor to join the Howard 

 government in voting our amendments down. 

 

 So, all that remains for the FTA to become overriding law is for an exchange of 

 those letters between the two governments, at the end of October.  Neither a 

 Latham nor Howard government will give our parliament back its power over 

 these committees before writing to George W Bush sealing the free trade 

 agreement into place. 

 

 In 1953, US President Dwight Eisenhower wrote ‘Every gun that is made, every 

 warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in a final sense a theft from those 

 who hunger and are not fed - those who are cold and not clothed.  This world in 

 arms is not spending money alone - it is spending the sweat of its labourers, the 

 genius of its scientists, and the hopes of its children.’ 

 

 It was a very Green statement.  In 2004, we Greens want Australia to take hold of 

 that grand American sentiment of the past.  Why should our middle-order nation 

 not take a lead for humanity in this world of violence and needless human misery? 

 

 Of course we must maintain our own defence. But we have to complement that 

 defence with good neighbourliness based on recognition of our place in the Asia 

 Pacific region.   

  10

 We should urge the US to engage in a new global Marshall Plan, to lift one billion 

 people on Earth out of the grind of disgusting poverty which saddles their lives.  

 With a small fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on the Iraq war, 

 the US and Australia could ensure every starving, sunken-eyed child on the planet 

 could be well fed, have clean water and sanitation and a local school to go to.  We 

 cannot bend to the criminality of terrorism. Yet we can strive more to take the 

 terror out of every child’s life through being Good Samaritans.  In return we can 

 have some of the terror removed from our own lives and help ensure that our own 

 children, wherever they may go, have a safer world in the years ahead. 

 

 This different future for Australia must also begin at home by putting 

 reconciliation with the First Australians back on the agenda.  As former governor-general William Deane said last week:  in the interests of justice and decency in 

 our land, we must rebuild and revitalise the national movement for reconciliation 

 and its call for a national ‘owning of the truth’ and apology for all the injustices of 

 the past’. 

 

 I have referred to the urgent need for better health funding for Indigenous 

 Australians. The Australian government should also better fund Indigenous art and 

 consult communities with a view to boosting regional Indigenous arts and culture 

 policies.  Indigenous artists should be returned most of the sale price of their art, 

 retain all the copyright, and receive a legally set percentage of any resale profit in 

 future years. 

 

 The Greens would foster an authentic Australian voice and culture for all 

 Australians.  We want ‘status of the artist’ laws, like those in Canada, to 

 acknowledge the contribution of all artists and craftspeople and to recognise them 

 as professionals deserving a practical economic support base. 

  11

 We, like Labor, back legislated action for artists to receive five percent of resale 

 price for their works, as well as a small annual return, like that which libraries pay 

 authors, for the display of artworks in public buildings. 

 

 The Greens also advocate an independent process, at arms length from 

 government, for appointments to the board of the ABC and the National Museum.  

 We back the British model where a Commissioner of Public Appointments 

 ensures the process is fair, open and transparent, and that appointments are made 

 on merit, not political patronage. 

 

 We would ensure the National Film and Sound Archive, here in Canberra, is an 

 independent and properly funded institution.   

 

 Fundamental to promoting Australian culture against the US flood - and in the 

 future, no doubt, the flood of Chinese and Indian entertainment, is to greatly 

 increase funding to the ABC and SBS, so that they can be leaders in the new 

 technologies, providing local content and multiple services, like the BBC with its 

 3 billion pounds budget. 

 

 The Greens would also initiate an Asia Pacific Arts Exchange to further enable 

 artists to visit and work in neighbouring countries, and promote visiting 

 exhibitions and performances.  We would expand support for intercultural arts 

 across our nation. 

 

 The ‘Greens under the beds’ brigade, including the Prime Minister and his deputy, 

 are exhibiting pretty irrational fear of our policies.  It is peculiar that such liberal 

 gentlemen find the Greens - and our vigorous, sensible policy platform - such a 

 fearful thing.   

  12

 They should relax - maybe by reading well-known Queensland University 

 economist John Quiggin, who wrote in the Financial Review on 29 July:  ‘The 

 Greens’ economic policy is one of the most coherent and intellectually defensible 

 documents of its kind yet put forward by any Australian party.’ 

 

 ‘In broad principles, it begins with the recognition that economic policy must be 

 financially as well as environmentally and socially sustainable.  Far from seeking 

 cheap popularity by arguing for both tax cuts and increased public expenditure, the 

 Greens have insisted that new public expenditure must be financed by higher 

 taxes.  In addition, they observe that public sector debt should be matched by 

 adequate capacity to service debt, and that dubious financial expedients such as 

 the use of privatisation to reduce measured debt should be avoided.  There is even 

 a commitment to consistent accrual accounting, something the major parties have 

 promised but not delivered!’ 

 

 Quiggin said pointed out that Australians who vote Green ‘are also choosing a 

 party with a policy that is economically as well a socially responsible.  If only the 

 major parties could claim as much.’ 

 

 Since that policy was put down, I have launched our Green Bonds proposal - to 

 raise from the public $3.5 billion per annum over the next ten years, through 

 government-assured bonds, the capital to spend on upgrading Australia's rickety, 

 run-down rail system. Green bonds could also go to improving the application of 

 water-saving, sewage improving and pollution control technologies across the 

 nation. 

  13

 Amongst our other policies the Greens will: 

 â¢ Legislate for fixed three-year parliaments 

 â¢ Fairly allocate oil and gas royalties to East Timor 

 â¢ Oppose the spread of gambling via the internet 

 â¢ Keep Telstra and Australia Post in public hands 

 â¢ Return 25% of its natural flow to the Murray-Darling river system  

 â¢ Divert the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on a new Christmas 

 Island jail for asylum seekers to public housing in Australia  

 â¢ Introduce a national paid parental leave scheme 

 â¢ Close tax loopholes for the rich to help lift Australians out of poverty, let 

 me stress it again, and 

 â¢ Reverse the scandalous neglect of Indigenous Australians' health needs. 

 

 We Greens are standing House of Representatives candidates in every seat across 

 Australia. We have strong Senate teams led by Christine Milne in Tasmania, 

 Rachel Siewert in Western Australia, Brian Noone in South Australia, David 

 Risstrom in Victoria, John Kaye in New South Wales, Drew Hutton in 

 Queensland, Mark Wakeham in the Northern Territory, and here with us today, 

 Kerrie Tucker MLA who aims to become the ACT's first Greens senator. 

 

 

 Kerrie, I hope you succeed, not least because that, alone, would put paid to the 

 Howard government's plan to repeat its 2001 Senate vote and so gain effective 

 control the Senate on the 9th of October. 

 

 I want to finish with a word of encouragement to prospective Greens voters. Go 

 ahead - it is double-value voting. If your vote does not elect a Green it will go 

 over as a whole vote to the next party of your choice. 

  14

 

 We Greens are offering a good choice to Australians who feel the big parties have 

 let them down. We are the values party. We are the responsible option and will, in 

 the next three years, continue to enliven Parliament House with our optimistic 

 brand of politics. We promise more of our eagerness to contribute to charting a 

 greater role of leadership for Australia in a world which needs more humanity, 

 ecological wisdom and long-sightedness lighting up its road to the future.
