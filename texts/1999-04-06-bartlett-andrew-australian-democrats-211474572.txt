  Australian Government must assist with refugee 
places for Kosovo crisis

  

  The Democrat spokesperson for immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett 
has  urged the Government to immediately offer a significant number 
of refugee places for those affected by the current crisis in Yugoslavia.

  

 Senator Bartlett strongly criticised the Government’s 
refusal to increase the number of places for refugees to assist with 
the current tragedy in Kosovo, describing it as ‘heartless’.

  

 “The government’s refusal to help with refugees 
is inexcusable from a so-called civilised country”, Senator Bartlett 
said.

  

 “The Australian government has supported the US-NATO 
bombing. Therefore we have a moral obligation as a nation to assist 
with the refugee crisis which is a consequence of that bombing.

  

 “We have to live up to our responsibilities.

  

 “Mr Ruddock shouldn’t hide behind excuses about 
problems with temporary refuge. Temporary refuge is a Hansonite solution. 
Australia shouldn’t be offering temporary refuge, we should be offering 
permanent resettlement for refugees who are obviously in genuine and 
urgent need.

  

 “If this wasn’t such a serious and urgent issue, 
Mr Ruddock’s excuse that Australia is too far away to take refugees 
would be laughable.”

  

 Senator Bartlett also encouraged Mr Ruddock to ‘fast-track’ 
visas for those affected by the Yugoslavian conflict who are already 
in Australia.

  

 “The Minister has said the Department will consider 
their cases, case by case, but the Democrats urge the Minister to offer 
blanket protection for all who apply,” said Senator Bartlett.
