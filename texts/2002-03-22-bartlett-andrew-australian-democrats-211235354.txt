 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats Immigration Spokesperson

 22 March 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                           02/137

 Unjust Migration Bill passes through the Senate with ALP support The Australian Democrats are appalled that the ALP has sided with the Government to rush through the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002, further reducing the rights of asylum seekers in Australia.

 In an act reminiscent of last September’s passage of migration legislation, the ALP combined with the Government to force the Bill’s passage through the Senate.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson said, “It is tragic that the ALP has gone along with the Government’s railroading of this Bill, particularly as it did not undergo scrutiny.

 “The Bill has major ramifications for refugees and asylum seekers, and yet the ALP and the Government actively prevented scrutiny of the Bill by Senate committees.

 “The Bill was amended yesterday to include unprecedented powers for the Immigration Department. These powers include the Department Secretary’s ability to stop an assessment of a refugee claim should they find the person to have been uncooperative at any time during the process - including at the time of initial contact with Australian officials or Defence Force personal.”

 Senator Bartlett continued, “The Bill is badly drafted and contains many loopholes; the impact on asylum seekers will be significant, irrespective of them being genuine refugees or not. It allows for Commonwealth Officers to use reasonable force, and yet it fails to define what is meant by ‘reasonable force’.

 “There is no definition of the term ‘temporary’, which can and will result in people being held in detention for indefinite periods of time.

 “The most disturbing aspect of the Bill is that, although people will be allowed to request a redetermination of their status from the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Secretary can halt that determination and remove them from the country at any stage during the process.  But the injustice doesn’t end there; this administrative decision to halt the process is not subject to appeal by the courts nor any administrative body.

 “The Australian Democrats are extremely disappointed that the ALP supported this legislation, particularly in light of the upcoming Senate Inquiry into the ‘Pacific Solution’. It can only be assumed that the ALP’s support for the establishment of the Senate Inquiry was for nothing more than political gain, and not out of genuine concern for the problems created by the Government’s ‘Pacific Solution’,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
