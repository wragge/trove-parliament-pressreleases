 HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION GRANTS AWARDED   

 Attorney-General Robert McClelland today announced 15 grants for community groups and non-government organisations to help improve human rights education across the country.   

 Mr McClelland said the successful projects are innovative education programs that will raise human  rights awareness across broad sections of the community.    

 “The centrepiece of Australia’s Human Rights Framework is human rights education, with a strong  focus on community education,” he said.    

 “Today’s $12.4 million investment reaffirms the Gillard Governments’ commitment to human rights  education initiatives across the community.   

 The projects receiving grants today include human rights workshops for Indigenous children in  remote communities in the Northern Territory, community training on domestic violence as a  human rights issue in North Queensland, self-advocacy training for people with disabilities in New  South Wales and a conference on human rights issues affecting older people in Western Australia.    

 “We must recognise that there is still more we can do to treat each other with dignity and respect -  real and lasting change in attitudes requires community involvement,” he said.   

 “Better education is critical to protecting and promoting human rights in Australia.   

 “A stronger understanding of human rights is fundamental to maintaining a safe and tolerant  nation.”    

 This year marks the second round of Australia’s Human Rights Framework - Education Grants.     

 “I have been impressed by the innovative projects that have been delivered under the human rights  educations grants program and look forward to those that will be delivered in the coming year,” said  Mr McClelland.
