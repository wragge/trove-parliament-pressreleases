 PRIME MINISTER

 FOR MEDIA

 The Government's newly established Advisory Council on   Multicultural Affairs is to prepare a National Agenda for a   Multicultural Australia.  I proposed this to the Council at   its inaugural meeting in Canberra today.

 The National Agenda will comprise a program of specific   priorities that will translate our policy of   multi culturalism into a series of concrete initiatives. It   will need to be developed on the basis of consultation with  

 a broad range of community interests.

 My Government sees multi culturalism as a key social policy   which significantly affects all Australians. It is central   to the pursuit of social justice.  There is a need to ensure   that all Australians, regardless of ethnic origins,  are able  

 to enjoy equal life chances.

 Through the National Agenda,  the Council is being asked to   assess how far Australia has come in achieving these   objectives,  and to chart future directions.  I envisage that   the Agenda will incorporate policies designed to promote   equity and access in both the public and private sectors, as   well as plans for effective community education.

 In determining a National Agenda for a Multicultural   Australia, the Council will look at such areas as the law,   education, employment,  health,  media,  culture,  women's and   youth affairs, trade unions and business.

 I am confident that the varieties of talents represented in   the Council will ensure that it is well placed to provide   the Government with the best possible advice.

 The 22-member Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs is   charged with providing advice to me and the Minister   Assisting, Mr Young, on ways in which the Government might   advance its objective of encouraging the further development  

 of our multicultural society. It is chaired by Justice Sir   James Gobbo, of the Victorian Supreme Court,  and includes Mr   George Wojak (Deputy Chairperson), of the Federation of the   Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia; Mr David Brydon,   Managing Director of ACI International Ltd; Sir Nicholas  

 Shehadie,  Chairman of SBS; and Mr Simon Crean, President of   the ACTU. The Advisory Council,  the full composition of   which is attached,  will be supported in developing the   National Agenda by the new Office of Multicultural Affairs   within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

 The National Agenda will look to a multicultural future in   which all Australians,  irrespective of background, are able   to participate fully in national life, in which community   resources are fairly available to all,  and in which the  

 skills and abilities of all Australians can be harnessed   without barriers of discrimination and prejudice.

 An action-orientated Agenda will make a major contribution   to my Government's commitment to equity. I see   multi culturalism as central to enhancing the quality of life   for the next generation of Australians.
