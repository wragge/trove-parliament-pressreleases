 AN ADDRESS FROM THE HON. A.S. PEACOCK TO THE UNITED NATIONS  ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA. '  .  ;

 "THE U.N. AND ITS RESPONSE TO GROWING PUBLIC CRITICISM"

 Delivered 12.30 pm, Tuesday June 10, Melbourne. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT STEPHEN BRADY 03 624 005.

 Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,

 Thank you for inviting me to be with you today and to speak with 

 you on the subject of "The United Nations and its Response to 

 Growing Public Criticism."

 My own involvement with the United Nations and its agencies goes 

 back a long way - well before I became Foreign Minister in 1975.

 My first official contact with the UN was in 1968 when, after two 

 years in Parliament, I was a member of the Australian Delegation 

 to the 21st Anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights - 

 held in Tehranll .  .  '

 You will appreciate, therefore, that I have, over time, had 

 considerable opportunity to observe and reflect on the work of 

 the United Nations and its performance.

 It is now over forty years since the founding of the United 

 Nations in San Francisco.

 Any celebration of a 40th anniversary

 - at least to the extent that the analogy to human life 

 suggests itself - -

 must invite reappraisal and reflection of its course.

 1

 Today, the UN is seen as an Organization which has failed to 

 maintain what it was primarily charged with

 - namely the securing of world peace and security.

 It is seen as an Organization drowning in its own sea of rhetoric 

 and endless paper, produced by a bloated and expensive 

 bureaucracy. .

 Its prestige is at an all- time low.

 Indeed, many, including myself, question whether, the.Organization 

 will survive.to old age without some major reforms.

 The first article of the UN's Charter prescribes the maintenance 

 of world peace and security as the first and primary purpose of 

 the United Nations.

 Yet, according to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute, there 

 have been more than 100 armed conflicts since the UN was founded. 

 26 million people have perished in those conflicts.

 What has gone wrong with the notion of collective security?

 I suggest several reasons why the collective security system has 

 not worked.  .

 2

 First - many of the member states of the.UN have quite flagrantly 

 violated the principles of the UN Charter, even though every 

 member country has committed itself to adhere to those 

 principles.

 Second,- the fifteen members of the Security Council Seldom act 

 in an impartial and judicial manner. ·

 The determination of the facts of a dispute by Council members 

 is inevitably affected by extraneous matters such as the 

 relationship between each Council member and parties to the 

 dispute. '

 The Council is often unable even to agree on who, in a conflict 

 is the aggressor and who is the victim - much less what measures 

 should be taken to redress the conflict. .

 Third - and importantly, has been the inability of the five 

 permanent members of the Council to work together. .

 The Security Council was designed to work properly on the 

 assumption of great power co-operation.

 In the current state of international relations it is clear this 

 assumption does not exist. .

 But it is not only the Security Council thathas let the UN down.

 3

 I believe the workings of the General Assembly, in recent years, 

 has substantially contributed to the poor reputation of the , 

 United Nations and has spurned growing western public 

 disenchantment.

 The credibility of the Assembly has been undermined by certain 

 actions of some non-aligned countries. '

 Resolutions are passed that are often inflammatory and lacking 

 consistency.

 I think here, for example, of UN Resolution 3379 equating Zionism 

 with racism. '

 I want to turn briefly to an important subject dealt with by the 

 UN - arms control and disarmament - for despite all the words 

 said and resolutions passed,  the Organization has failed to make 

 real progress. '  -  ,  '  .

 It is an area the UN devotes considerable resources and time.

 In addition to the General Assembly sessions each year, there is 

 the UN Disarmament Commission,  and ,the Conference on Disarmament 

 which meets year round in Geneva.

 The UN even has its own Institute of Disarmament Studies.  .

 4

 Despite all this,  however, there is little concrete to show.

 - Why? .  -

 Too often, there is little congruence between what member states 

 say they support at the UN and what they actually do.

 So often, formal proposals are put forward that are only intended 

 to score points against an adversary. .

 Again, lack of progress comes down to a reason I advanced, on the 

 failure of collective security - that is the failure of the 

 Soviet Union and the United States to achieve lasting, meaningful 

 co-operation. .

 Turning now to some of the specialized agencies of the UN - and 

 UNESCO here comes to mind, we have seen an excessive ‘

 politicization of economic and social issues. .

 Rhetoric has too often replaced reason..

 A particular concern of the United States, and one shared in 

 Australia by the Liberal and National Parties, is that doctrines 

 of economic determinism often take hold in such Councils, serving 

 only as excuse to centralize the power of the state.

 The United State's concern is, I believe, fully justified.

 5

 The primacy of individual rights over the demands of the State 

 must be continually emphasized. Individual initiative, 

 creativity and freedom must be stressed, as must the role of the 

 market economy and the private sector.

 In the case of UNESCO the US demonstrated that it was not 

 prepared to have the agency used for polemical North-South 

 confrontation.

 A further reason for the United State's concern - specifically at 

 UNESCO and generally at the whole UN structure,  is the question 

 of its financial management and accountability.

 The US currently provides over twenty five percent of the 

 Organization's total budget.  .

 The US provides 34% of the UN's peacekeeping money - contrast 

 this with the Soviet Union's paltry 2.7%' contribution.

 It is understandable that no US Government can justify to its 

 citizens the huge increases of cost the UN incurs" each year, 

 while its own domestic programs are having to be significantly _ 

 reduced. . . .  :  .  .  ,

 Equally, it is understandable that the US finds it frustrating to 

 provide large measures of economic and security assistance to 

 nations that consistently thwart their efforts at the United 

 Nations. .  .

 6

 After a period of substantial growth, I believe the time has come 

 for the'UN to soberly reflect on its priorities and to make real 

 efforts to reign in its mammoth costs. .

 Closely related to the subject of financial accountability and 

 restraint within the UN, are questions on the international civil 

 service that works for the Organization.

 When the Secretariat was established, it was based upon the 

 concept of an independent international civil service.

 Many countries, mostly communist, have,  however, .never accepted 

 this concept; the result is that over the years, the whole 

 process of recruitment and promotion has become highly 

 politicized. .  .

 I have touched on a number of areas of the UN system and 

 highlighted some of the more important criticisms levelled at it.

 I think it important to balance these criticisms.. We must not 

 lose sight of the notable successes that the Organization has 

 had. â 

 I think this has been particularly so in some of the lesser 

 publicized agencies.  The World Food Program, now headed by an 

 Australian, is such an example., The World Health organization 

 and its eradication of major diseases has been another success.

 7

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is another. 

 Whilst looking on the positive side, we should not overlook the 

 value the office of Secretary-General can provide.

 "Quiet diplomacy" - as it is often referred to - is still a 

 highly effective tool of international negotiation and 

 settlement. .  .  ·  .  .

 An example of the good the United Nations, through the office of 

 the Secretary-General, can do, came during 1979-80.

 You'll remember that Vietnam had then expelled/encouraged large 

 numbers of its unwanted citizens to leave the counfry by boat, 

 often unseaworthy ones. .

 The exodus, of the boat people, as the media came to call them, 

 reached alarming proportions. The Secretary-General convened a 

 high-level conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva, at which 

 I was elected Chairman.

 The Geneva conference proved extremely productive.

 First, the Western countries agreed to increase their intake of 

 Indochinese refugees.

 Second, the conference raised a very large sum of money to take 

 care of the refugees. .

 8

 Third, the then Secretary-General succeeded in negotiating an 

 agreement with the Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister whereby 

 Vietnam agreed to discourage the exodus of boat people and agreed 

 to allow the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to establish an 

 office in Vietnam in order to arrange for the orderly departure 

 of the Vietnamese who wished to leave their country.

 In any discussion of the UN, *we must do more than just produce a 

 litany of faults.  ,

 I believe, some of the following ideas could be usefully examined 

 to improve the efficiency of the UN System.

 The Organization might:

 - examine ways of encouraging more meetings without the 

 ensuing - often damaging - glare of publicity;

 - examine ways of conducting its work without the

 constant need for voting; _  .

 - limit the number of matters for discussion at the 

 General Assembly and restrict the number of speakers 

 and their speaking time;

 - use article 99 of the Charter much more ?  this article 

 gives the Secretary-General scope for initiative and 

 independence;

 9

 - consider the holding of General Assemblies biannually. 

 They are just a few ideas.

 I firmly believe that solutions to the UN's crisis of credibility 

 lie not in its abolition but in its reform.

 One commentator has said "if the UN did not exist,  the imperative 

 of global interdependence would probably compel us to create an 

 organization very much like it".

 Someone once asked a former British Ambassador to the UN,. Lord 

 Caradon, what was wrong with the Organization. ,

 He replied - "Nothing is wrong with the UN except its members 1"

 This is a truism - for whether the UN will become a stronger, 

 more effective organization must, of course, depend on the 

 policies and practices of its member states.

 It must depend upon their individual and collective will to 

 correct the shortcomings of the organization.

 In recent years, notably since the Reagan Presidency, we have 

 seen just such a reappraisal of the UN Organization by the United 

 States. ·

 President Reagan's approach has been pragmatic, realistic, but 

 constructive. .

 10

 The US has quite properly insisted upon greater financial 

 accountability by the organization and recognition that its 

 runaway growth must be restrained.

 It has spoken out about the politization of the UN system and the 

 increasing tendency to transfer"those polemics to technical, .

 developmental and humanitarian agencies. '

 The debate over the UN and its values must be welcomed as must be 

 American attempts to arrest the deterioration.

 The UN is not and cannot be a world government.

 We still live in a world dominated by the sovereignty of 

 individual nation States.

 The organization has not been the panacea its founders had 

 dreamt, but its ideals still stand as lofty aspirations of 

 mankind's highest hopes.

 For all its problems, it has been and can be a force for great 

 good. . .

 The Liberal and National Parties support the UN and in Government 

 will seek to do everything possible to bring about active 

 consideration of reform - reforms that may enable the 

 Organization to enjoy a happy middle age and beyond.
