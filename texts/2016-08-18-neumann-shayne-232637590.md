 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR   

 

 DUTTON MUST OUTLINE PLAN FOR MANUS CLOSURE   

 Immigration Minister Peter Dutton must secure proper third country settlement options  for refugees following the decision to close the Manus Island Regional Processing  Centre. 

 He must explain how he will resolve the fate of asylum seekers currently languishing in  Papua New Guinea. 

 He must clarify the terms and timeframe of the agreement with the PNG Government  and outline what resources will be provided for refugees to resettle in Papua New  Guinea.  

 The Turnbull Government must be upfront and honest with the Australian people about  their intentions for the hundreds of asylum seekers in Australiaâ€™s offshore processing  facility. 

 Labor is committed to making sure that people smugglers are not allowed back in  business, and regional processing is an important measure to prevent tragic deaths at  sea.
