 AA 04 047                Tuesday 6 July 2004 

 

 Australian support for fiscal reform for Palestinian Authority   

 I am pleased to announce that Australia will contribute $1 million towards the World Bank's  multi-donor public financial management reform trust fund for the West Bank and Gaza.   

 The  World  Bank  established  the  reform  trust  fund  to  further  strengthen  the  Palestinian   Authority's  financial  management  mechanisms,  to  reduce  poverty  and  to  support  the   advancement of the Middle East peace process.    

 These objectives accord with Australia's own policy goals including to strengthen the capacity  of Palestinian institutions to provide essential services to Palestinian refugees.    

 Poor services and deteriorating infrastructure in Gaza, particularly in Rafah, has marginalised  vulnerable groups in Palestinian society.  The reform trust fund will assist the Palestinian  Authority to sustain essential service delivery to those Palestinians in most need.   

 The trust fund is performance-based and benchmarked on achievements in budget allocations  and accountability.     

 This  contribution  is  part  of  an  estimated  $12  million  in  Australian  assistance  to  support   Palestinian refugees over 2004/05.
