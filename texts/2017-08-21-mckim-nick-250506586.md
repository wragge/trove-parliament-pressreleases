 Media Release: Dutton cannot ignore pregnant women in his care 

 August 21, 2017 

 Peter Dutton's denial of care and rights to refugees in his care on Nauru is an attack on their  humanity, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says. 

 "It is simply not acceptable for women to be denied basic health and reproductive rights just because  it is politically convenient for Mr Dutton," Senator McKim said. 

 "These are ideological decisions that must be overturned." 

 "Basic human rights and freedoms are not negotiable - these women and their children must be  brought to Australia immediately." 

 "The humanitarian crisis that Peter Dutton has created on Manus Island and Nauru needs to end  now."  "Australia's prisons on Manus Island and Nauru must be evacuated, and every woman, child and  man brought to Australia."
