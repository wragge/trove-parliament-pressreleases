 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT A MUST     

 Labor is deeply concerned by a report in the media that a female asylum seeker  currently in Nauru is being refused medical treatment by the Australian Government.    

 This case must be treated sensitively and the Australian Government must make it  clear this woman will be provided with medical treatment, including access to a  termination, if that is her request in Australia.    

 Malcolm Turnbull must make it clear this woman will be afforded the opportunity to  seek medical treatment in Australia.    

 Any decision she makes should remain a private matter between her and treating  health professionals.
