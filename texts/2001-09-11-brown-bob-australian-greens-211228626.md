 PM Should Abide by Justice North's Tampa Decision

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has called on the Prime Minister to abide by Justice North's decision on the Tampa case. North has found that the asylum seekers on board the Tampa were held in detention without lawful authority.

 "The Government should accept Justice North's decision and not bring Australia further international odium by delaying the right course of action through the appeals system," Senator Brown said.

 "The Manoora should return to Australia and the asylum seekers should be processed here because the outcome will be the same.  Some will be sent home most will get to stay in Australia.

 "It is clear from Justice North's decision that proper communication to the asylum seekers has not been allowed. The asylum seekers must now immediately be given access to independent legal advice.

 "Mr Howard has lead Australia into a huge mess by trying to take political action outside the laws of this country.

 "Mr Howard is leading this country further and further into division and international embarrassment.  Justice North's decision should be the circuit breaker for Mr Howard to change course," Senator Brown said.
