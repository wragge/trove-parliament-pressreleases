Greens MPs Senator Bob Brown, Giz Watson MLC , Jim Scott MLC, Lee Rhiannon 
MLC, Ian Cohen MLC, Peg Putt MLA, Kerrie Tucker MLA and the Greens Party 
in Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.

  

  The Greens phone link agreed to the following policy response:

  

  1. That the Australian 
Government should immediately recognise East Timor as a sovereign nation.

  

  2. That Australia 
should support a multilateral armed interventionary peacekeeping force 
being deployed in east Timor, with or without t he Indonesian 
Government’s approval. (Note: The Greens agree with legal experts 
who state the East Timor is no longer Indonesian territory at international 
law, but is an international protectorate until the precise nature of 
its sovereignty has been established.)

  

  3. That Australia should immediately end all Military cooperation with 
Indonesia

  

  4. To support Senator 
Brown’s call for a new United Nations war crimes tribunal to investigate 
Indonesian war criminals, including General Wiranto.

east Timorese seeking asylum in Australia

local, national and international campaigns over the coming days, with 
the following actions agreed to immediately:

  

  1. The Greens have 
undertaken to ask members to give sanctuary to east Timorese asylum 
seekers. (Note: In response to the Australian government’s refusal 
to grant asylum to Timorese refugees, thousands of Australi ans 
have offered their houses to a Church run Sancturary Network which will 
hide the refugees in the event that the Federal Police attempt to detain 
or deport them.)

start a national letter writing and E-mail campaign for the United Nat ions
