 From the Minister for  Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. THE HON. IAN MACPHEE,  M.P.

 â â --78 16 June 1981

 AUSTRALIA TO ASSIST DISABLED INDOCHINESE REFUGEES '

 Australia is to accept disabled Indo-Chinese refugees as  

 part of its contribution to the International Year of Disabled  

 Persons.  â 

 This was announced in Bangkok by the Australian  

 Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee,  

 after a visit to Malaysia and Thailand.

 Mr Macphee said that arrangements for the program would be .  

 developed with the specialist Federal and State authorities in  

 Australia. Refugees resettled from South East Asia would be  

 selected on a case by case basis.

 The Minister indicated that an additional program to accept  

 disabled persons under·, other categories of Australia's immigration  

 intake was being developed and would be announced in the near  

 future. ·  .

 "We have already accepted some refugees with disabilities  

 among more than 50 000 now in Australia", the Minister said.

 .  "The decision, however.  represents a special approach to  

 the needs of the few refugees whose handicaps .are such that they  

 would, need considerable care and support in resettlement.  It is  

 also consistent with our humanitarian approach to help solve the  

 refugee problem." â 

 The assistance of the Australian community would be sought '  ·  

 through the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme (CRSS).  No  

 numerical limit had been placed on the program. This would depend  

 on the number seeking assistance and Australia's capacity to help.

 Mr Macphee left Bangkok after a four-day visit  

 to Thailand where he discussed the refugee situation,  and saw at  

 first hand a number of refugee centres,  including some in the  

 more remote parts of Thailand.  .  ’  â 

 During his visit Mr Macphee had discussions with the Minister  

 of Foreign Affairs,  the Acting Minister for the Interior, the  

 Secretary-General of the National Security Council,  the UNHCR  

 Regional· Co-ordinator for South Fast Asia and Australian officials  

 concerned with refugee resettlement.

 The Minister visited refugee centres at Khao-I-Dang, Phanat  

 Nikhom, Nong Khai, and Ban Vinai.  During his visits to these  

 centres the Minister paid tribute to the humanitarian work being  

 done by the Thai authorities,  UNHCR,  and voluntary agencies. He  

 took the opportunity to have discussions with Australian  

 volunteers engaged in these activities in Thailand, as he had  

 done in Malaysia.

 "There is a continuing need to focus the attention of the  

 international community on the plight of refugees in our region,"

 Mr Macphee said. "With the problems associated with refugee  

 outflow persisting there is a danger that countries not immediately  

 affected, might lose sight of the magnitude of the problem.

 Much still needs to be done." .

 The Minister said that there was no simple solution to the  

 problem. It needed to be tackled in a variety of ways including  

 material assistance to the immediate needs of the refugees,  the  

 development of arrangements for voluntary repatriation,  the  

 negotiation of orderly departure programs,  and resettlement in  

 third countries,

 .  Australia.believes that voluntary repatriation is the most  

 desirable solution for many refugees provided proper arrangements  

 can be made for their return in conditions of security and safety.  

 During his talks with Thai Ministers,  Mr Macphee was told that no  

 refugees would be forcibly repatriated.
