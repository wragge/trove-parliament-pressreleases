 Green or Mean

 The mean spirited approach by both major parties towards asylum seekers leaves voters to look to the Senate and the Greens and Democrats as a humanitarian alternative", Senator Bob Brown said in Canberra today.

 Kim Beazley has locked himself into this political basement with John Howard - it is a basement without the light of human kindness and dignity for refugees in appalling trouble.

 On allegations that asylum-seekers threw their children overboard, Senator Brown called on Mr Howard to; * allow journalists access to the asylum seekers and * produce the naval authorities' memo or a spokesperson who was at the scene.

 Senator Brown challenged Mr Howard's leadership as both mean and manipulative, saying that bringing back vilification of refugees on the eve of the election is putting the nation on trial, with evidence suppressed, for political gain.

 'Ever since the Tampa affair there has been an obvious censorship by the government which includes blocking press access to asylum seekers and naval vessels as well as a ban on naval personnel sending emails or digital photos home. This is part of Mr Howard's manipulative fear-mongering and cuts across the public's right to know, to be fully informed", he said.

 Senator Brown said Mr Howard's stern isolationist policy bent has also left Australia isolated with the US at the global warming discussions in Marakesh.

 "This Prime Minister is wrecking Australia's previously proud reputation for environmental and humanitarian leadership", Senator Brown said.
