 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS IMMIGRATION - PLAYING ITS ROLE IN AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE

 As a direct result of Coalition policies today’s migration program will enhance living standards by some $323 per head or by $6.7 billion in total by 2007-08. Additionally a net benefit to the budget of $3.7 billion can be expected over the next 4 years, based on our current goals.

 The Coalition in Government has maximised immigration’s contribution to Australia’s social and economic growth by instituting significant reforms to the policies it inherited from Labor in 1996.

 "The effect of these reforms are for all to see," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Coalition has completely restructured the immigration program by cracking down on rorters, re-balancing the economic and social benefits and comprehensively addressing unauthorised arrivals, despite the efforts of the Labor Party to be obstructionist the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock said today.

 "Not only are our programs good for the country as a whole, they are also delivering better outcomes for new migrants to Australia," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Labour market research has demonstrated that skilled, independent migrants are achieving unprecedented success in finding jobs and contributing to the Australian economy."

 Under Labor, 70% of the immigration program was set aside for family sponsored migration - a category with high and sustained levels of unemployment. Even Labor MP Mark Latham acknowledged this as a problem:

 "…unskilled family reunion programs in the 1980s, they just weren’t a success…I mean I’m not saying it’s the fault of the migrants, I think it’s the fault of the policy makers…the dumbest thing anyone could do is repeat the mistakes of the 1980’s". (19/09/01)

 The Coalition will continue to administer an immigration program that:

 is free from discrimination based on race, religion, gender, nationality or country of origin; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» has integrity and compassion as its defining ethos; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» has the confidence of the Australian community in its administration and rationale; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» is suited to Australia's national interests and international responsibilities; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 balances economic, social, environmental and international considerations. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Mr Ruddock indicated that it is not simply permanent migration that works in Australia’s interest.

 Economic, budgetary and employment gains are also derived from well-balanced, responsive temporary entry policies.

 The Coalition’s temporary entry, visitor and student policies have resulted in a record year of visa delivery in 2000-01 providing significant economic benefit, while continuing to enhance Australia’s reputation as a provider of world class tourism, educational and employment opportunities.

 "The Coalition will continue to provide humanitarian assistance and resettlement opportunities to those persons experiencing persecution or gross violation of basic human rights," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Coalition remains absolutely committed to refugee protection.

 "However, our refugee resettlement programs depend on continuing community support which in turn depends on our ability to limit abuse in the protection system," Mr Ruddock said.

 Highlights of the Government’s Achievements The Coalition has constructed a migration program that has enhanced living standards in Australia by some $264 per head in 2000/01and will contribute a total net gain to the Commonwealth Budget of $3.7 billion over the next four years.

 Skilled migration comprises 54% of the total program - up from 30% during the last Labor government.

 The 2001/02 migration program will see an increase to 85,000 places, including 37,900 in the Family Stream and 45,500 places in the Skill Stream.

 More than 3.5 million visitors arrived in Australia in 2000/01.

 More than 160,000 temporary entry visas were issued in 2000/01.

 146,577 student visas were granted in 2000/01. This was a 23% increase over the 1999/2000 figure of 119,103.

 The Coalition will continue the working holiday scheme at current levels of around 75,000 visas annually.

 In 2000/01, Australia resettled 13,733 people under the refugee and humanitarian program.

 Australia is an active participant in global refugee settlement and, along with the annual resettlement program, Australia provided temporary safe haven to 3,900 Kosovars and 1,800 East Timorese.

 In the offshore program in 2000/01, Australia resettled 7,992 people. A further 5,577 places were granted onshore.

 The Coalition introduced legislation to provide 3-year temporary protection visas, instead of permanent visas, to unauthorised arrivals recognised as requiring Australia's protection. TPV holders are able to

 depart Australia but there is no provision for return travel to Australia and family reunion options are not available.

 Australia is providing UNHCR with $28 million and is the thirteenth largest donor of financial resources to the UNHCR's core budget.

 The Government has provided $20.8 million over four years to support displaced Iraqis and Afghans in Iran and Pakistan.

 In response to the unexpected surge of unauthorised boat arrivals in 1999, the Government adopted a comprehensive and integrated cross-portfolio strategy that included legislative and regulatory changes designed to protect our borders.

 

    Immigration - Its Role In Our Future   

 The  Coalition’s  Immigration  Policy  will   continue  to  be  managed  with  integrity  and   compassion  so  as  to  deliver  economic  and   social  benefits  to  the  community  whilst   ensuring  that  Australian  sovereignty  is  not   compromised.

 Executive Summary/Key Points   

 The Coalition in Government has maximised immigration's contribution  to Australia's social and economic growth by instituting significant  reform of immigration policy.   

 Policy initiatives since the last election have been marked by efforts to  ensure that:   

 â¢  migration and entry programs are more closely aligned with  Australia's economic requirements and the needs of immediate  family to be reunited; 

 â¢ Australia is able to respond in the most effective manner to  international crises through a flexible, well-targeted refugee and  humanitarian program; and 

 â¢ border control policies are constructed around an integrated,  comprehensive approach that recognises that these are  international problems that require international as well as  domestic solutions. 

 The Coalition believes that it is the sovereign right of Government to  decide who will and who will not enter Australia.  From that principle  the Coalition will administer an immigration program that:   

 â¢ is free from discrimination based on race, religion, gender,  nationality or country of origin; 

 â¢ has integrity and compassion as its defining ethos; 

 â¢ has the confidence of the Australian community in its administration  and rationale; 

 â¢ is suited to Australia's national interests and international  responsibilities; and 

 â¢ balances economic, social, environmental and international  considerations. 

 

 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 3 

 Labor’s Alternative   

 Under Labor, 70% of the immigration program was set aside for family  sponsored migration - a category with high and sustained levels of  unemployment compared with other entrance categories.   

 “…unskilled family reunion programs in the 1980s, they just weren’t  a success…I mean I’m not saying it’s the fault of the migrants, I  think it’s the fault of the policy makers….the dumbest thing anyone  could do is repeat the mistakes of the 1980’s”.   (Labor MP, Mark Latham 19/09/01)   

 In Government, Labor failed to resolve the status of certain temporary  entrants, including 40,000 PRC nationals who entered Australian after  the Tianenman Square Massacre.   

 Under 13 years of Labor the refugee intake was slashed by more than  two thirds while an increasing emphasis was placed on the Special  Assistance Category --a Category the ALP used for political purposes.   

 While the Coalition has completely restructured the immigration  program by cracking down on rorters, re-balancing the economic and  social benefits and strengthening our borders, the Labor Party has  been obstructionist, divided, weak on leadership and devoid of ideas.    

 The Labor Party's immigration policy is to "conduct a review of  migration".   

 The Labor Party's detention policy is to "conduct a judicial inquiry into  the management of detention".   

 The Labor Party's border control policy is to pass the Coalition's  legislation, but  then "change it when we get into Government".   

 The Labor Party showed weak leadership when it refused the passage  of legislation that would put beyond doubt the sovereignty of Australia  to determine who can and who cannot enter Australia.    

 The Labor Party says that it is concerned that people are detained for  too long while awaiting decisions on asylum claims, yet it obstructed  for 5 years legislation that will limit appeals to the courts.   

 Labor sends conflicting signals that it wants to be firm on visa  overstayers and illegal workers, but it has campaigned against building  new facilities to detain these people.   

 Labor is also sending conflicting signals in relation to continuing  support for the policy of mandatory detention.   

 

 4 Immigration - Its Role In Our Future 

 

 

 

 Labor's Obstructionism   

 In Opposition, Labor has obstructed efforts to strengthen the integrity  of the program and reduce the incidence of abuse and rorts.  In the  past five years, Labor has:   

 â¢ obstructed passage of legislation that would limit appeals to the  courts; 

 â¢ obstructed the Border Control Bill that would have put beyond  doubt the sovereignty of Australia to determine who can and who  cannot enter Australia; 

 â¢ obstructed passage of legislation that would limit the ability of  unlawful non-citizens to join class actions to delay their removal  from Australia; 

 â¢ disallowed Regulations that would have prevented Protection Visa  applicants from accessing Medicare;  

 â¢ watered down measures designed to address non-bona fide  applicants in the family stream; 

 â¢ rejected measures to give the Government the ability to determine  the number of migrants entering in the spouse category; 

 â¢ disallowed a Regulation that would require the majority of an  intending migrant’s children to be in Australia before they can be  sponsored as a parent under balance of family; 

 â¢ disallowed a Regulation that would meet the Coalition election  commitment to seek full cost recovery of English language tuition  charges; and 

 â¢ obstructed passage of legislation to allow an extra 4,000 parents  who choose to meet some of their own health and welfare costs, to  enter Australia. 

 

 What Labor Says   

 Labor will roll-back achievements in the temporary migration programs  and deny Australian business the flexibility it requires to remain  competitive in the growing world economy. Labor’s policy is to:   

 "review the system of temporary entry visas and act to prevent the  establishment in Australia of a semi-permanent group of "guest  workers" on short term but renewable visas".   

 Labor will threaten the viability of the Working Holiday Program by  imposing caps on the scheme.  This effectively means that there will  be no more reciprocal agreements with other countries and the 

 

 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 5 

 opportunities for young Australians to travel and work overseas will be  restricted.   

 Labor has flip-flopped in response to the surge in unauthorised  arrivals, with the Opposition spokesman saying at various times:    

 "the government must now view the flood of illegal immigrants as a  major crisis and a possible threat to national security" (May 1999)   

 In July 2000, however, the Opposition spokesperson said:   

  "the reality is that it’s not a crisis".

 The Way Forward   

 Part 1 Migration and Temporary Entry   

 Australia has benefited from the energy, skills, enthusiasm,  commitment and diversity that new settlers have brought to their new  home.  We will continue to benefit from these attributes of immigration.   

 It was a Coalition Government that presided over the arrival in  Australia of millions of migrants in the 1950s, 1960s, late 1970s, and  early 1980’s.  These periods spanned the greatest diversity ever  experienced in our official immigration intake.     

 Coalition Governments also opened up large-scale immigration from  continental Europe, the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, the Middle  East, and more recently Asia and the Pacific. With other nations, we  have played an important humanitarian role in resettling millions of  people from war-ravaged regions around the world.     

 A  Permanent  Migration  

 

 The Coalition has achieved a migration program that balances  economic and labour market needs, with the need for close family  reunion.   

 (i)  Skilled  Migration  

 Australia's skilled migration program is properly targeted to meet  Australia's labour market and economic needs. In 2000/01 the skilled  migration program brought 44,730 new migrants to Australia.     

 Under the Coalition, Australia's most recent migrants are younger,  better skilled and more likely to get employment than ever before.   

 Research has shown that the migration program in 2000/01 enhanced  living standards in Australia by some $264 per head and will contribute  a total net gain to the Commonwealth Budget of $1.3 billion over the  next four years. In addition, research has shown that compared with  the continuation of Labor’s 1995-96 Migration Program, changes made  by the Coalition over the last five years, including the 2001-02  Migration Program, if continued over the next 5-6 years would enhance  living standards by some $323 per head or by $6.7 billion in total by  2007-08.   

 â¢ Skilled migration comprises 54% of the total program - up from 30%  during the last Labor government. 

 â¢ The 2001/02 program will comprise 45,500 places. 

 â¢ The Skill Stream contingency reserve has been expanded to 8,000  places to accommodate increased demand.  

 

 

 

 8 Immigration - Its Role In Our Future 

 

 

 

 â¢ Applicants in the Skilled Australian-Linked category will continue to  be required to meet the skill and English language requirements of  the independent skilled category.  Family connection will continue  to be a criterion for entry. 

 â¢ The Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) coverage has  been expanded with the addition of 16 regional certifying bodies.   Approximately 3200 visas have been granted under RSMS since  1996, with 1021 alone in the 2000-01 program year. 

 â¢ New streamlined strategies have assisted in the provision of  medical practitioners in areas where there is a demonstrated  shortage of doctors.  In 1999-2000 almost 1500 visas were  granted. 

 â¢ A number of initiatives were introduced to streamline entry  arrangements for ICT workers. 

 â¢ The Coalition introduced a "Migration Occupations in Demand List"  to address skill shortages, particularly in the IT sector.  Almost 30%  of entrants under the new points test now have recognised IT skills. 

 

 (ii)  Family  Migration  

 Coalition immigration policy, as well as being focussed on Australia's  economic wellbeing, will ensure the maintenance of Australia's  commitment to the role of the family through family reunion.    

 The Family Reunion program will continue to have as its primary focus  the reunion of close family members including spouses and partners,  dependent children and orphaned relatives, parents and last remaining  relatives.   

 The 2001/02 migration program will see an increase to 85,000 places,  including 37,900 in the Family Stream and 45,500 places in the Skill  Stream.   

 The Coalition will continue to press the Opposition to pass legislation  allowing the entry of an additional 4,000 parents who are willing to  meet their share of health and welfare costs, through the family  stream.   

 B  Temporary  Entry  

 

 The increased international flow of goods, services and people means  Australia must have an efficient and effective visa system able to  handle millions of short term, or temporary, arrivals.  As people  become more internationally mobile this aspect will play an increasing   role in government decisions.     

 At June 30, 2000 there were about 440,000 people, across all  categories, in Australia on temporary visas. 

 

 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 9 

 

 

 

 More than 3.5 million visitors arrived in Australia in 2000/01.   Government forecasts estimate this figure will more than double, to 7.6  million, by the year 2003.  This huge growth in movements presents  enormous opportunities and challenges to government.   

 More than 160,000 temporary entry work visas were issued in 2000/01.   

  (i) Business Entry  The Coalition recognises the important contribution made to the  Australian economy by temporary business migrants. We are  committed to running an effective program, which will bring highly  skilled and successful business people with their entrepreneurial skills  and experience to Australia.    

 Increasing the availability of, and emphasis on, temporary entry visas  for business migrants recognises that Australian businesses must  have access to skills, ideas, contacts and technology from overseas to  be successful in today’s increasingly global economy.   

 The Coalition introduced the following measures to streamline  business entry:   

 â¢ The Long Stay Business Visa now allows genuine overseas  business people to obtain visas quickly for periods ranging from  three months to four years. 

 â¢ Short Stay Business Visas enable entry of people undertaking one-off short-term contract work. 

 â¢ The APEC Business Travel Card was introduced to provide  business people in our region with simplified entry. 

 â¢ Business Centres have been established in each State and  Territory to provide a comprehensive and streamlined service for  business travellers. 

 â¢ A Business Advisory Panel comprised of senior Australian business  people to provide advice on ways in which the international  movement of business people to Australia can be facilitated without  sacrificing border integrity. 

 

 (ii)  Students  

 The Coalition is committed to encouraging a sustainable growth in the  international education sector by: facilitating entry arrangements  where there is a low risk that students will overstay or otherwise abuse  their visa conditions; and encouraging applications only from genuine  students in high-risk markets.   

 On 1 July 2001, a number of reforms to the program were introduced.   

 

 

 10 Immigration - Its Role In Our Future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The main change to the program was the introduction of seven visa  subclasses:     

 â¢ Independent ELICOS Sector 

 â¢ Schools Sector 

 â¢ Vocational Education and Training Sector 

 â¢ Higher Education Sector 

 â¢ Masters and Doctorate Sector 

 â¢ Non-award Foundation /Other Sector 

 â¢ AusAID or Defence Sector. 

 

 Students must apply for a visa in the visa subclass that relates to the  principal course of study they wish to undertake.     

 A record number of visas, 146,577, were granted to overseas students  in 2000/01.  This was a 23% increase over the 1999-2000 figure of  119,103.   

 Major source countries for students applying offshore were the  People’s Republic of China (8886 - up 46%), the United States (7426  - up16%), Malaysia (6236 - up 6%), Indonesia (6070 -- up12%) and  Hong Kong SAR (5740 - up 26%).   

 The undergraduate sector showed particularly strong growth with an  increase in offshore visa grants of 47%, from 26,233 to 38,555.   

  (iii) Working Holiday Makers  The Coalition will continue the working holiday scheme at current  levels of around 75,000 visas annually.   

 Only citizens of arrangement countries are eligible to apply for  Working Holiday visas. Australia has reciprocal working holiday maker  arrangements with 12 countries: Canada, the Republic of Ireland,  Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malta, the Netherlands, the United  Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Hong Kong.   

 The program has successfully promoted Australia as a place to visit  and the Coalition in Government will consider extending reciprocal  arrangements with other countries.   

 Working holiday makers also have a positive effect on the Australian  economy, with their projected spending expected to total more than  $700 million annually.    

 

 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 11 

 The working holiday maker scheme also assists Australian employers  by ensuring that they have access to a large pool of seasonal workers  and do not need to resort to recruiting illegal workers.   

 The number of Working Holiday visas granted has increased gradually  in recent years, from around 35 000 in 1994/95 to over 76 500 in  2000/01.    

 Last year, around 27 000 young Australians travelled overseas under  reciprocal working holiday maker arrangements.   

 (iv)  Tourist Visas 

 The Coalition introduced a new sponsored visitor visa category,  enabling the entry of people who might otherwise not qualify.   

 More than 3.5 million visitors arrived in Australia in 2000/01.   Government forecasts estimate this figure will more than double, to 7.6  million, by the year 2003.  This huge growth in movements presents  enormous opportunities and challenges to government.    

 â¢ The Coalition introduced streamlined procedures to enhance  Australia’s tourism industry including the expansion of the  Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) to 31 nationalities. 

 â¢ The International Events Coordinator Network was established to  help event organisers ensure smooth entry arrangements for their  delegates and participants. 

 â¢ The Approved Destination Status scheme arrangements with China  have facilitated a growing number of Chinese tourists.   

 

 12 Immigration - Its Role In Our Future 

 

 

 

 Part 2 Refugee and Humanitarian Program   

 Australia has a long and proud humanitarian record which the  Coalition has continued to uphold whilst in government.   

 However, the Government is determined to limit as much as possible  the current high levels of abuse of the asylum system in Australia.   Many unauthorised arrivals are not fleeing persecution.   

 In 2000/01, Australia settled 13,733 people under the refugee and  humanitarian program.   

 Australia is one of only nine countries in the world that operates a  dedicated offshore resettlement program that accepts the world's most  needy and desperate refugees.   

 Of those nine countries, Australia offers resettlement places second  only to Canada on a per capita basis.   

 Australia is an active participant in global refugee settlement and  along with the annual resettlement program, Australia provided  temporary safe haven to 3,900 Kosovars and 1,800 East Timorese.   

 Australia places considerable importance on constructive engagement  with international and multilateral organisations in our efforts to  respond to the needs of refugees.    

 Over the past five years the Coalition has re-focused efforts to ensure  that countries of first asylum are provided with the capacity to support  refugees within their borders and prevent their onward travel to other  countries.   

 â¢ In the offshore program in 2000/01, Australia resettled 7,992  people.  A further 5,577 places were granted onshore. 

 â¢ The Coalition introduced legislation to provide 3-year temporary  protection visas (TPV) to unauthorised arrivals recognised as  requiring Australia's protection, instead of permanent visas.  TPV  holders are also not permitted to leave and re-enter Australia and  are denied family reunion. 

 â¢ Australia is providing UNHCR with $28.6 million this financial year  and is amongst the 12 largest donors of financial resources to the  UNHCR's core budget. 

 â¢ More than $14.3 million is provided annually through the Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Scheme to assist newly arrived refugees  settle successfully in Australia. 

 

 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 13 

 Part 3 Unauthorised Arrivals and Detention   

 The Coalition maintains that it is the sovereign right of any nation to  determine who does and who does not enter its borders for temporary  or permanent stay.    

 From this fundamental principle the Government has adopted a  comprehensive, integrated strategy to ensure the continued integrity  and accountability of Australia’s immigration program.   

 The Coalition is also determined to limit abuse of the asylum system  by those who seek to arrive in Australia unlawfully.   

 These measures range from the development of networked links  between overseas posts to prevent abuse of visa provisions, to the  implementation of measures to deter the employment of illegal workers  and a strengthened response to the record levels of people arriving in  Australia illegally.   

 The Government's approach to the issue of unauthorised arrivals  comprises three major elements:   

 â¢ prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries  of origin and secondary outflows from countries of first asylum; 

 â¢ working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and  intercept illegal migrants en route to Australia, while ensuring that  those people in need of refugee protection are identified and  assisted as early as is possible; and 

 â¢ developing appropriate detention arrangements for unauthorised  arrivals who reach Australia, focusing on the early assessment of  the refugee status of the individual, the prompt removal of those  who are not refugees, or who are refugees but can access effective  protection elsewhere, and the removal of additional benefits to  minimise the incentive for people to attempt illegal travel to  Australia. 

 

 A Unauthorised Arrivals Strategy 

 

 In 2000/01, more than 5,649 people arrived in Australia unlawfully.  Of  those, 4,141 arrived in 54 boats and the balance arrived by air.   

 The Coalition has been developing strong relationships with source,  first asylum, donor, destination and transit countries, in international  forums and with the UNHCR and other international organisations to  develop consensus on the need for action and strengthened  cooperation.   

 In November 2001, the Asia Pacific Council will hold its 6th Plenary  Session in Manila to discuss irregular migration and people smuggling  and Australia will continue to press for greater regional cooperation. 

 

 14 Immigration - Its Role In Our Future 

 

 

 The Coalition will also continue bi-lateral discussions throughout the  region on the interception and assessment of irregular migrants.    In October 2001, there will be a visit by high-level Malaysian officials, 

 as well as a working-level delegation of Cambodian officials to follow  up an earlier visit by senior officials.  In November, a high level  Vietnamese delegation is also expected to visit to discuss capacity  building proposals.   

 The Coalition in government has also introduced and passed  legislation to deal comprehensively with abuse of Australia's asylum  procedures.  Legislation that restricts the interpretation of the 1951  Refugee Convention will ensure that only those with bona fide claims  will get refugee status.    

 In order to strengthen the message that Australia will not tolerate  abuse of its migration and humanitarian programs, the Coalition has  legislated to allow the off-shore processing of people attempting to  arrive illegally on our shores.   

 Currently, processing centres are being established on Nauru and  Papua New Guinea and facilities on Cocos and Christmas Islands are  being upgraded.   

 Those processed offshore who are assessed as genuine refugees will  be able to apply to third countries for re-settlement, including Australia.   

 â¢ $20m was allocated over four years in the 2000-2001 budget for  initiatives aimed at addressing the humanitarian needs of diplaced  Afghanis and Iraqis in the Middle East and South West Asia 

 â¢ The Coalition provided $14.3 million in 2001/02 in targeted  humanitarian aid to address push factors in countries of origin and  first asylum. 

 â¢ Legislation was passed to establish temporary protection visas to  reduce the attractiveness of Australia for those seeking to enter  illegally and claim asylum. 

 â¢ The Coalition also passed legislation to prevent abuse of the  judicial process to extend the stay of people who have no  entitlement to be here. 

 â¢ Most unauthorised arrivals dispose of documents and misrepresent  their identity and nationality.  The Coalition has passed legislation  to discourage such abuse. 

 â¢ The Coalition has been seeking reform of the international  protection system to ensure that protection is available to those  who need it, in the countries where they first seek asylum. 

 â¢ The Coalition introduced legislation to exclude from Australia's  asylum process those who have access to effective protection  elsewhere.  

 

 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 15 

 â¢ A further $9 million was allocated in 2001/02 to support initiatives  to resolve the situation of displaced Afghanis. 

 â¢ The Coalition initiated and has sustained dialogue with countries of  origin and first asylum aimed at putting in place an interlocking web  of return and readmission agreements. 

 B  Detention   

 

 The Government remains committed to the principle of mandatory  Detention for all persons without authority to be in Australia.   

 Since December 1992, Australian law requires that all unlawful non-citizens are detained until they are granted permission to remain in  Australia, or until they leave voluntarily or are removed.   

 Detention ensures that people are available for processing and that  health and character checks are completed before they are released  and subsequent removal if their claims are not sustained.   

 The Government has ensured that the detention regime is humane and  that all detainees are treated with dignity and respect.   

 All detainees are provided with access to appropriate medical and  health services, including mental health, recreation and education  facilities.   

 The Government has established six detention facilities around  Australia: Curtin RAAF Base, Port Hedland, Woomera, Perth,  Villawood and Maribyrnong.   

 The Government announced a 10-year strategy that will see new  permanent detention facilities established in Brisbane and Darwin.   

 The Government also announced plans to increase contingency  capacity for dealing with unexpected surges in arrivals.  These include  a temporary reception and processing centre at HMAS Coonawarra in  Darwin, overflow capacity centres at El Alamein in South Australia, and  Singleton in NSW, and current detention facilities refurbished and  consolidated with a commitment of over $52 million in last year’s  budget.   

 From 7 August 2001, alternative detention arrangements have been  trialed for 25 women and children in cluster houses in Woomera.   

 Since the sharp increase in late 1999 in the number of unauthorised  arrivals, the Government has substantially re-engineered the  processing of unauthorised arrivals without compromising the integrity  of its assessment.   

 80% of protection visa applications made by unauthorised boat arrivals  in late 1999 received a decision within seven and a half months, this

 has been reduced to less than 14 weeks for applications lodged in late  2000.   

 Where applications are straightforward, decisions can now be made in  as little as 2-3 weeks after lodgement.     

 Detainees who remain in detention for longer periods are usually  exercising their choice to pursue appeal through the judicial system  and this can sometimes take several years.   

 The Coalition has introduced legislation to reduce the capacity of  unlawful arrivals to access extensive judicial appeal processes.   However Labor and minor parties blocked the passage of this Bill for  over five years.
