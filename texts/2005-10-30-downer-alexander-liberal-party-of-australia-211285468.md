 MEDIA RELEASE   MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER

 Australian Assistance to Help Relieve Hunger in  Malawi  

 The Australian Government has boosted its contribution to emergency relief efforts in  southern Africa where it is estimated five million people need urgent food aid in  Malawi. 

 Australia will provide $2 million in emergency relief to support the United Nations  emergency response to the crippling food crisis in Malawi. The funds will be  channelled through the World Food Programme (WFP) for urgently needed food for  malnourished children and the most vulnerable households. 

 This brings Australia's humanitarian and emergency assistance to southern Africa to  $6 million for 2005-2006. Demands on Australia's emergency funds for Africa have  reached unprecedented levels in the past 18 months, with southern Africa  experiencing its fourth consecutive year of drought. 

 The Malawi crisis has been compounded by its high HIV/AIDS infection rate for  adults, chronic poverty, and increasing numbers of orphans and refugees due to  famine and disease. 

 The Australian Government through AusAID continues to provide emergency food  assistance to around eight million people in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique,  Zambia, Uganda, Lesotho, and Swaziland and is closely monitoring ongoing  humanitarian needs across Africa. 

 Australia's total official development assistance to Africa during 2005-2006 will be an  estimated $77 million and will be used to respond to humanitarian crises, fighting the  spread of HIV/AIDS, promoting good governance and improving the delivery of basic  services.
