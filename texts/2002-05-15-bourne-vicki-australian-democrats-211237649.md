 Increasing overseas aid would have been smart defence policy

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed the small increase in the aid budget for debt relief  under  the  HIPC  initiative,  but  are  greatly  disappointed  that  Australian  aid  has fallen as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI).

 The  Democrats  are  also  reserving  judgement  on  the  overall  program  until  it  is  clear whether the Government is claiming refugee processing as part of Australia’s overseas development assistance.

 “It  is  deeply  concerning  that  while  the  rest  of  the  developed  world  has  recognised poverty’s  role  in  fostering  fundamentalism  and  hatred,  the  Government  has  failed  to increase  the  overseas  aid  budget,”  said  Democrats’  spokesperson  for  Foreign  Affairs, Senator Vicki Bourne.

 “Australia  has  deep  pockets  for  fighting  wars,  but  not  for  building  peace,”  Senator Bourne said.

 “By June next year the war on terror will have cost Australians $2.1 billion.

 “At  the  same  time,  the  total  level  of  Australian  generosity  towards  rebuilding Afghanistan’s fractured society will only have amounted to around $40 million.

 “On those figures, Australia’s commitment to ensuring long term peace and security in that  dangerous  region  is  only  1.9%  of  the  commitment  to  fighting  the  war,”  Senator Bourne said.

 “This year, Australia will slip even further down the OECD’s table of overseas aid donors. At only .25% of Gross National Income, our overseas aid program is well below the OECD average of .39% and even further below the UN’s recommendation of .7%

 “Both Europe and America have substantially increased their aid commitments following September 11.

 “Spending money on overseas aid is not only compassionate, it is smart defence policy,” Senator Bourne concluded.
