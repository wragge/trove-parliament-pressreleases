 Introduction: on responsibility, politics and contemporary Australia 

 

 ‘Responsibility’ is a ubiquitous theme in contemporary Australia. It is writ large in 

 institutional politics and social policies that aim to engineer and reward personal 

 responsibility. This is particularly evident of course in the field of social welfare 

 where the principles of mutual obligation scaffold government policy (Centrelink 

 2002; McClure 2000). Much emphasis is placed on the responsibilities of individuals 

 for themselves, to themselves, to others and to the government. Accompanying this 

 is increasing interest in corporate responsibility and corporate citizenship (Cronin 

 2001). Responsibility - especially getting the right mix of the governmental, the 

 corporate and the personal - shapes mainstream political discourse. To some extent, 

 discourses about responsibility and ‘the right mix’ offer a mode of distinguishing the 

 political parties and framing political choices.  

 

 Alongside the domains of the institutional and governmental, and sometimes in 

 response to them, the politics of responsibility has taken rather different forms most 

 especially in the calls to non-Indigenous Australians to take responsibility for the 

 past treatment and present positioning of Indigenous people in the political 

 community and national imaginary. Here the emphasis is on a richly conceived 

 collective responsibility that defies conventional interpretations of responsibility as 

 individualised accountability for actions personally undertaken or neglected. The 

 recent debates on Australia’s approach to asylum seekers and refugees has also 

 appealed to Australians’ sense of themselves as participants in a political collectivity 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 3

 with responsibilities that are both more than and less than those captured within the 

 ambit of citizenship and the nation state.  

 

 In addition to the material prepared by campaigning and policy groups that seek 

 policy changes on reconciliation, state responses to refugees and broad social justice 

 issues, a philosophically shaped literature has developed. Within this, theorists such 

 as Moira Gatens, Genevieve Lloyd, Rosalyn Diprose and Linnell Secomb have 

 extended insights from philosophers including Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas 

 and Jean-Luc Nancy to analyse Australian conditions and the possible meanings and 

 ethics of responsibility (Gatens  and Lloyd 1999; Diprose and Secomb in Healy et al 

 eds 2003). Both the campaigning and the philosophical writings argue for the 

 embrace of collective responsibility but they also question what that means. Not only 

 is the meaning of responsibility carefully examined, but frequently so too is the 

 meaning and nature of the “subject” of responsibility: who is the ‘I’ or ‘we’ that 

 might take responsibility? Responsibility is simultaneously pursued and 

 problematised. However, it is noteworthy that the insights from this literature are 

 not taken up in the governmental and policy focussed discussions of responsibility 

 and the latter is the weaker for it. 

 

 This paper is part of a larger project that brings these two literatures into 

 conversation with each other in a critical examination of the character and 

 ramifications of politicised responsibility in Australia today. Here the specific focus 

 is the argument that Australian society is increasingly fragmented, civility and 

 mutuality are moribund and, that ‘all-round’ intensification of responsibility is an 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 4

 essential requirement in redressing this situation, for generating civic renewal and 

 the creation of a society that can thrive in the uncertain conditions of the 21st century. 

 Some version of this argument is presented by both the major parties and it is a 

 recurrent theme in media diagnoses of the troubles of our times. One of the strongest 

 advocates of this position is Mark Latham who summarises his perspective (coming 

 from what he describes as the ‘new radical centre’) as follows: 

 

 The guiding principle of the new radical centre is to hold the cohesiveness and 

 fairness of society together through new expressions of personal and collective 

 responsibility. During this era of globalisation and insecurity, each of us as 

 individuals plainly need to do more to advance our own interests - to study 

 harder, to prepare and save more effectively for an uncertain future, to work 

 smarter, to develop the competitive skills that deliver job security in an open 

 economy. But just as much we also need to do more together - to look out for 

 each other, to aid those who are struggling to help themselves, to support each 

 other in the values and interests we hold in common. The new radical centre is 

 best understood as a political assertion of this heightened sense of 

 responsibility, not just in the relationship between citizens and government, 

 but also between citizens and society. (1998, xxxi) 

 

 Latham has consistently advanced these claims in his numerous speeches and other 

 substantial publications (in Botsman & Latham 2001;  Latham 2003). His work is a 

 significant intervention into the debates about responsibility and is here subject to a 

 close reading.  

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 5

 

 The paper begins with a contextualisation of Latham’s perspective that links his 

 arguments for more ‘all-round responsibility’ to his diagnosis of the socioeconomic 

 challenges of the present. The second section examines in detail the idea of ‘all-round 

 responsibility’ and highlights the incommensurabilities of power and position that this 

 further entrenches. These incommensurabilities indicate some problems with the claim 

 that greater responsibility leads to a heightened responsivity of citizens to each other 

 and to the generation of new forms of mutuality. This claim is further challenged in 

 the following section where the links between politicised responsibility and public 

 resentment are explored. The last section turns to the question of “the subject” of 

 responsibility. Here some insights from the philosophic literature are particularly 

 cogent. Overall, as the conclusion explains, the current argument that the 

 intensification of responsibility - individual, corporate, governmental - is 

 unambiguously good and can massage into existence new modes of public mutuality 

 is not convincing. 

 

 Latham’s responsibility: living and relating in 21st century Australia. 

 

 Latham’s insistence that Australia requires increased responsibility from individuals, 

 corporations and communities is a consequence of his diagnosis of our times; a 

 diagnosis that echoes the writings of other ‘Third Way’ theorists (e.g. Giddens 1998 

 and 2000; Barber 1996). These have been extensively and critically discussed in 

 Australia (see e.g. Johnson 2003; Bacchi & Nursey-Bray eds 2001). The following is 

 therefore, just a brief review of key themes. For Latham, the most striking feature of 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 6

 the present, which is also its challenge, is that we are living through multifaceted 

 economically instigated transitions. These affect how we produce, consume, 

 communicate and interact with each other in all contexts from the personal to the 

 local, the national and the global. Most significantly, he believes that we are shifting 

 from an industrial to an information age and that the industrial socioeconomic 

 divisions (especially labour and capital) are therefore no longer pertinent, or not as 

 pertinent as they used to be.  Further, the older ideological positions associated with 

 the left (labour) and right (capital) neither offer plausible analyses of the present nor 

 political guidance for future directions (Latham 1998; 2003; Latham in Botsman and 

 Latham 2001). From this, issues the challenge of how to think differently and create 

 alternative political frameworks. And, as is well known, in Latham’s view, the 

 direction to be pursued is ‘beyond left and right’, the elaboration of a ‘third way’, a 

 politics of the ‘new radical centre’. 

 

 According to Latham, new modes of political analysis and action are needed, modes 

 that allow a critical embrace of the challenges of the present. He suggests that the age 

 of transition, which is also the age of intensified globalisation, is marked by the 

 increasing inefficacy and fiscal unsustainability of the welfare state, the emergence of 

 new information elites and changing labour force conditions (1998; 2003). 

 Additionally, the economic transformation has brought about widespread social 

 transformation that for many people, and Australian society as a whole, is 

 overwhelmingly negative: ‘With the erosion of traditional institutions, society has 

 entered a period of moral confusion. People are longing to belong - to rediscover the 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 7

 shared values and trust of a good society. They want to focus on relationships and 

 morality much more than economic policy.’ (2001c in Botsman and Latham, 249)  

 

 Throughout his writings, Latham emphasises the cohesiveness, the civic-mindedness 

 and mutuality of the world we have lost, a world in which, allegedly, people felt 

 secure, connected and trusting. A world that has been replaced by ‘a decline in social 

 connectedness’, in which the capacity of citizens and/or civil society to act as ‘rule-

 makers’ has been minimised and in which ‘the relationship between states, markets 

 and society has become imbalanced.’(2003, 232 and 234). Interestingly, despite 

 sometimes close attention to documenting his claims, Latham does not offer any real 

 evidence of this sense of loss and yearning that he believes marks the ‘politics of 

 public culture’ (2003, 20) or, of exactly when, and for whom, this idealised inclusive 

 community of the past existed. It is a recurrent theme, though, amongst like-minded 

 third way proponents. Benjamin Barber - political theorist and erstwhile advisor to 

 President Bill Clinton - identifies similar developments in the United States and, again 

 without supporting evidence, a ‘yearning for community’, the need for a ‘common 

 identity or a collective membership.’ (1996, 154) 

 

 What these yearnings, problems and transitional moments signify to Latham is the 

 need for new forms of governance in which the state ‘enables’, rather than dictates, 

 where solutions to social and political problems are ‘community-led’ (Latham 2001c in 

 Botsman and Latham, 249), where political power is ‘devolved’ and ‘de-hierarchised’ 

 (2001c) and where social fragmentation is countered by ‘mutual trust’, ‘mutual 

 recognition’ and a reinvigorated civic life. This requires the development of new forms 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 8

 of citizenship (Latham 2001b in Botsman and Latham) and ‘a new kind of solidarity, 

 one that crosses economic and class boundaries, one that goes beyond personal 

 identities and prejudices.’ (2003, 28) It is about relationships between citizens, not (or 

 not primarily) about relationships between citizens and governments. And central to 

 all this, perhaps even the glue around which everything coheres, is responsibility - 

 ‘all-round responsibility’: ‘Responsibility from all, opportunity for all: that’s what I call 

 a good society.’ (Latham 2004a, 6) 

 

 Responsibility, citizenship and mutuality 

 

 ‘Responsibility from all’ is at first glance an attractive idea. But what exactly does it 

 mean? The easy answer is that we must all be responsible for ourselves and to ‘the 

 community’ (however that is understood) and that, by virtue of membership in a 

 political community, we incur obligations to each other. We should be both 

 responsible to others and responsive to the needs of other members of the community 

 - provided, of course, that they too are recognisably responsible citizens. The devil is 

 in the detail. Once we delve in more depth into the arguments around responsibility it 

 is quickly apparent that we are not all responsible in the same way, or for the same 

 things. A differential responsibility prevails that exposes the fragility of the 

 connections between the responsibility, responsivity and mutuality that Latham and 

 others would craft. Two examples will illustrate this; firstly, the contrast between 

 individual and corporate responsibility and secondly, the contrast between the 

 obligations of welfare recipients and those of the ‘officially independent’ who are 

 obliged to respond to the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged. 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 9

 

 Latham is very clear that  any  intensification of responsibility must apply equally to 

 the powerful and the powerless: 

 

 New forms of governance are needed to generate active well-being: social 

 investments, lifelong learning and the devolution of service provision, each 

 underpinned by policies of mutual responsibility. This principle should 

 apply across the board, to the rich as well as the poor. … Social democrats 

 need to bring the corporate sector into the net of mutual responsibility. 

 (2001c in Botsman and Latham, 258) 

 

 He is quite specific about the kinds of obligations that corporations have to the 

 communities or nations in which they are located and argues that corporations should 

 only be eligible for government assistance if they abide by a ‘Code of Corporate 

 Citizenship’ (2001c, 258). There is growing interest in corporate citizenship and 

 corporate responsibility and an increasing number of companies pursue philanthropic, 

 community partnerships and other strategies that might indicate both responsibility 

 and responsivity. However, as Cronin concludes from her survey of recent research: 

 ‘while many Australian companies see these issues as part of their core business, many 

 more see stakeholder engagement as a community strategy.’ (2001, 13) The bottom line 

 is the bottom line. However, even if all major corporations in Australia committed to a 

 rich version of corporate responsibility, would this imply some sort of equity in the 

 demands for responsibility directed at the rich and the poor, the powerful and the 

 powerless? The answer is clearly no. 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 10

 

 When corporate and individual responsibilities are referred to as if they are inter-

 changeable, indicative of, in Latham’s terms, ‘responsibility all round’ or ‘all shoulders 

 to the wheel’, the specific modality of those different responsibilities is disguised. ‘The 

 powerful’ rarely exist as individuals with responsibilities instead they are the 

 embodiment of capital. Their responsibility is second-order, mediated, channelled 

 through the contingent geographies of investment and infrastructure and their 

 function as owners, employers or managers. Their responsibility is depersonalised, 

 corporate-collective, specific, yet because depersonalised, abstract. It is claimed that 

 they have responsibilities to their local communities but it is recognised that these will 

 always be offset by their responsibilities to their shareholders. In contrast, the 

 responsibilities of the poor, the weak, and the disadvantaged are direct, immediate. 

 “The community’, the ‘hand that feeds them’, demands the personalisation of 

 responsibility and failure to display this is responded to with proscription of their 

 lives and heavy penalties. What sense does it make here to speak of mutual 

 responsibility as if what is exchanged is somehow equivalent? 

 

 The policies that cluster under the heading of ‘mutual obligation’ also indicate 

 incommensurability in responsibilities, this time in the contrast between the 

 responsibilities of the ‘officially dependent’ with those of the ‘officially independent’. 

 And there is no better place to start in demonstrating this than with the government’s 

 bald statement of the meaning of ‘mutual obligation’ on the Centrelink website: 

 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 11

 If you are looking for work, the Australian community supports you in many 

 ways, for example by paying income support, offering Centrelink self help 

 facilities and referral services. Mutual obligation is about you giving 

 something back to the community which supports you. This means you are 

 expected to actively look for work, accept suitable work offers and undertake 

 extra activities to improve your chances of finding work.’ (2002, 1) 

 

 The overall tone or dynamic is one of generosity versus debt rather than equally 

 mutual obligation. This inequality or ‘one-sidedness’ is also identified by Richard 

 Curtain (2002) who has undertaken comparative research on the meanings and 

 implementation of mutual obligation schemes in the United Kingdom compared with 

 Australia. He observes that mutual obligation in Australia is ‘punitive in tone’ and, 

 though there is considerable focus on the responsibilities of citizens, there is much less 

 on what the government’s obligations might be (which is in stark contrast to the UK 

 experience) (2002, 2 and 3). Jeremy Moss (2001) makes a similar point. He notes that 

 the policy of mutual obligation provides no clear statement on what ‘obligations’ are 

 and how they might strengthen our commitments to each other. He draws our 

 attention to the fundamental imbalance in the relationship that is “after all” based on 

 unequal power and coercion. He distinguishes ‘having obligations’ from ‘being 

 obligated’: ‘Someone has political obligations where they, for instance, freely consent 

 to authority or a contract … But when circumstances force them to act in a certain way 

 they are obligated.’ (2001, 6). It is a significant point and it can be pushed a little 

 further. For example, consider a situation where an obligation is apparently ‘freely’ 

 contracted into (where say the ideas of self-improvement and ‘giving-back’ have 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 12

 become a part of the identity and aspirations of the welfare recipients and they have 

 ‘freely’ embraced their obligations) and where those obligations are matched by more 

 viable levels of income support, appropriate training and so on. Does this situation 

 illustrate a relationship of mutual reciprocity? If by mutual reciprocity we mean that 

 we are obligated in the same way, to the same extent, through shared commitment 

 and equal recognition, then the answer is no. 

 

 The contrast between the more general individual responsibility of members of the 

 Australian community and the individual responsibility of the welfare recipient is also 

 thrown into sharp relief in the McClure Report (2000) which inspired the changes to 

 social welfare policy. The Report states that ideas about individual responsibility are 

 ‘deeply embedded within the varied cultural traditions that constitute the Australian 

 community’ (2000, 39). The report illustrates these responsibilities with examples such 

 as:  

 

 â¢ ‘Providing assistance to friends and neighbours in need (informal social 

 assistance) 

 â¢ Taking an active interest in matters that affect our neighbourhood, state 

 and country. 

 â¢ Working with others to address matters of shared concern… 

 â¢ Through gifts of time and money, support other members of the 

 community working to address issues that impact upon us all.’  

 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 13

 Such responsibilities recognise, accentuate and enhance the independence of these 

 subjects of obligation. Compare ‘gifts of time and money’, the positioning of the 

 responsible agent (the ‘officially independent citizen’) as creditor and distributor of 

 largesse with the responsible agent who is in debt to the community by virtue of 

 receiving unemployment benefits and must offer up her/his labouring, or 

 volunteering body in payment of the debt. There is a substantial difference between 

 ‘giving to’ and ‘giving back’. Christine Everingham (2001) similarly observes that 

 despite the government’s stated interest in facilitating ‘community relations of 

 mutual dependence’, the policy of mutual obligation ‘… is promoting a totally one-

 sided experience of community. Only those in receipt of welfare will experience 

 themselves as being dependent on society as a whole.’ (2001, 112) 

 

 If the primary objective of mutual obligation is to discipline the poor and stimulate a 

 more extensive sense of social duty in other people, this lack of equivalence is not 

 necessarily a problem; however, this is not the usual argument. Instead, mutual 

 obligation is commonly presented as part of a more wide-ranging governmental 

 interest in the revival of civic culture and the devolution of administrative if not 

 political power. It aims to contribute to the elimination of social exclusion and the 

 overcoming of personal dependence. Yet, by positioning the obligated welfare 

 recipient as a potentially suspect, dependent debtor, it re-creates social exclusion. It 

 issues a paradoxical and impossible command: ‘You are obliged to be independent 

 and the pathway to independence is to embrace your dependence and the debt that 

 incurs.’ 

 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 14

 These examples demonstrate that the links between responsibility and mutuality are 

 by no means straightforward despite the fact that they are frequently coupled 

 together. They also indicate some reasons why we might question the plausibility of 

 the argument advanced by Latham and others that increased ‘all-round’ 

 responsibility will foster an accentuated responsivity of citizens to each other and 

 deepen the mutuality and strength of social connections. To be fair, Latham’s 

 mutuality cannot be reduced to a simplistic formula of 

 responsibility=responsivity=mutuality. For him, mutuality also involves the 

 devolution of political power, the strengthening of communities, the construction of 

 ‘new networks of association and common purpose’ (2000, 3) and a conversion of 

 ‘the ideals of social capital … into democratic practice’ (2000, 5). It is a complex and 

 carefully elaborated argument. However, threaded through his diverse forays into 

 mutualism is the emphasis on responsibility. There may be responsibility without 

 mutualism but there cannot be mutualism without responsibility. There is no 

 avoiding the problem. If ‘responsibility’ has this logical and adhesive function yet, as 

 has been demonstrated, its mobilisation is fraught with tension and ambiguity, then 

 it may be the loose thread through which the carefully knitted components of 

 Latham’s argument unravel. 

 

 So far, the analysis has highlighted the incommensurabilities and the lack of 

 equivalence in governmental and other institutional sites where the politics of 

 responsibility are enacted. The problems are not ‘simply’ imbalances of power but 

 involve questions of meaning, of lived experience and of the complexity of inter-

 subjective life more broadly. I will now outline two further and inter-related 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 15

 dimensions to the problem of arguing for responsibility. These also cast doubt on the 

 strength of the connections between responsibility, responsivity and mutuality. The 

 first of these can be simply put: the demands on individuals of living with an ever 

 expanding sphere of things for which one is responsible is already too burdensome 

 and the intensification of responsibility is more likely to foster resentment than a 

 desire for mutuality. The second dimension, which follows from the first, concerns 

 the “subject” of responsibility. Here I draw on the more philosophical literature 

 referred to in the introduction to question the imagination of the ‘I’ and the ‘we’ on 

 which contemporary calls for greater responsibility rest. 

 

 Resentment and the burdens of responsibility 

 

 Underlying the debates about responsibility, the requirement of civic revival and 

 new modes of public mutuality, is a wide-ranging institutional and governmental 

 preoccupation with the kind of person or citizen who is needed for the future and the 

 type of skills, capacities, competencies that are required for successful participation 

 in life, work and the polity in the 21st century. At issue is not only participation in the 

 existing polity, but also participation in the creation of the polity to come. Within 

 these debates a distinctive figure emerges, the ideal responsible worker-parent-

 citizen. The production of this responsible citizen is an explicit educational aspiration 

 that can be traced from kindergarten through to university. Responsibility is to be 

 recognised and rewarded indeed, it is demanded. The end-product citizens are not 

 only competent in life, citizenship and inter-personal relationships; they are also 

 responsible for that competency. They must be made, and make themselves into, a life-

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 16

 long learner, an effective parent and a responsible, respectful and active member of a 

 plural and multi-cultural society. The burdens of responsibility are large. In Latham’s 

 revitalised social democracy, refreshed citizens equipped with core-competencies, 

 must not only be able to perpetually reinvent themselves to deal with a changing and 

 uncertain world, but also to reinvent their own communities. They are charged with 

 the responsibility of ‘Building a Nation from our Neighbourhoods’ (2003).  

 

 The responsibilisation of worker-parent-citizens is not confined to Australia but is a 

 characteristic feature of late-modern life in western liberal democracies (and perhaps 

 elsewhere) in which:  ‘The well-being of all …has increasingly come to be seen as a 

 consequence of the responsible-self government of each.’ (Rose 1999a, 264). But what 

 are the subjective and inter-subjective effects of all this ‘responsible self-government’, 

 this ‘double movement of autonomization and responsibilization’? (Rose 1999b, 174) 

 According to William Connolly (1991) they are far from beneficent and he finds that 

 in the United States he finds they are intimately connected to a cultural malaise of 

 generalized resentment - an argument that plausibly be applied to Australia. 

 

 Connolly argues that the demand that we ‘take as our project, the making of our 

 lives’ is not a recent requirement. Rather, the stress on autonomized responsibility is 

 at the historical centre of liberal-democratic citizenship. (1991, 20 and 21) In the 

 present, the scope of responsible citizenship is a complex web of relations and 

 requirements. His analysis (1991, 21) is worth quoting at length: 

 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 17

 Individuals are responsible not merely for particular actions, but, to varying 

 degrees, for the character they develop, the stability of their mental lives, the 

 careers they nurture, the quality of their love lives, the way their children turn 

 out, the level of income they “earn”, the social recognition they attain and so 

 on. Background notions and institutions of love (where each chooses the other 

 free from traditional constraints), self-responsibility (where one is held 

 accountable for what one does and becomes), equal opportunity (where one’s 

 career and income flow from one’s own ability, effort and luck), individual 

 freedom (where the consequences of one’s actions are linked at least loosely to 

 intentions that go into them), and citizenship (where each plays a part in 

 shaping rules and laws governing all) - each of these practices is enabled and 

 confined by relations it bears to the others.  

 

 However, and perhaps one should say ‘on top of all this’, the institutional and 

 bureaucratic context in which these responsibilities are realised (or not) has shifted so 

 that ‘One must now program one’s life meticulously to meet a more detailed array of 

 institutional standards of normality and entitlement.’ (1991, 21) Failure to do so may 

 result in the application of disciplinary regimes or social and economic 

 marginalisation. This sense of disciplinary confinement also fosters the production of 

 a state of ‘dependent uncertainty’ as anything one has responsibly achieved might be 

 lost, superseded, become irrelevant to the times, and so on (1991, 23) In turn, this 

 exacerbates existential resentment and incites animosity toward anyone who appears 

 to escape these obligations. “If I suffer, so should you” - which puts a rather different 

 spin on the idea of ‘mutual obligation’. Resentment is especially directed at the 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 18

 ‘officially dependent’ by the ‘officially independent’. In Australia this is 

 demonstrated in the frequent hostility to economic support for Indigenous 

 communities that sharply contrasts with the respect usually granted to economic 

 support for farming communities (presumably Indigenous farmers might be 

 positioned in either camp). 

 

 The implication of Connolly’s analysis is that, far from decreasing resentment and 

 building feelings of mutuality, the demand for greater responsibility may inspire 

 further resentment. ‘All round responsibility’ might indeed stimulate ‘all-round 

 resentment’. There is a clear comeback position that Latham, and others, might have 

 to this analysis. Latham could reasonably point out that his proposals for increased 

 responsibility go hand in hand with a decrease in bureaucratic and governmental 

 power. After all, he fervently commits himself to the devolution of power. As a 

 consequence of this, his version of contextualised responsibility could counteract and 

 undermine the existing problems, such as bureaucratic domination, that Connolly 

 identifies. It is a reasonable argument, but it fails to take account of the ambiguous 

 logic distinguishing feature of the new modes of governance that accompany the 

 further responsibilisation of life. 

 

 The idea of the ‘enabling state’ expresses Latham’s commitment to the dispersal of 

 power, the de-bureaucratisation of society and a new role for government as ‘a 

 facilitator of community projects and social outcomes, rather than a director of 

 passive programs and laws.’ (2001c in Botsman and Latham, 248) It implies a 

 decrease in governmental power and an increase in the power of organisations, 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 19

 individuals and communities. However, the enabling state signals not so much a 

 decrease in governmental power but a shift in the mode of governance - towards 

 what Rose refers to as ‘government through freedom’ or ‘government through 

 community’ (1999a xxiii, 1999b: 176). And, as Rose observes (1999b, 170) in an 

 analysis of some similar themes in the work of Alistair MacIntyre, what we witness is 

 an ‘attempt to create, by political action, that which is to be the counterweight and 

 antidote to political power itself.’ Community - the space to which power is 

 devolved - is both an alternative to governmental power and an intense site of 

 governmental activity. Rose (1999b, 167-168) explains that advocates of this new 

 ‘third’ space of community power differ in a number of ways but what they share is 

 the following paradox: 

 

 On the one hand, the third space … appears as a kind of natural, extra-political 

 zone of human relations; and this ‘natural-ness’ is not merely an ontological 

 claim but implies affirmation, a positive evaluation. On the other, this zone is 

 identified as a crucial element in particular styles of political government, for 

 it is on its properties and on activities within it that the success of such 

 political aspirations and programmes depend. This third space must, thus, 

 become the object and target for the exercise of political power whilst 

 remaining, somehow, external to politics and a counter-weight to it. 

 

 One of the outcomes of the transformation in the mode of governance is greatly 

 energised political interest in the creation of new kinds of people, in new kinds of 

 political subjectivity that will enable the accentuated responsibilisation of 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 20

 individual and communal life. In addition to the examples of this interest provided 

 above, we could note the animation of this desire in current national and 

 international efforts to identify key competencies and embed them in national 

 programs of skills development. This extends from the international participation in 

 the OECD’s DeSeCo (Definition and Selection of Competencies) project (Trier 

 October 2001), through the graduate attributes programs in Australian universities, 

 to the current debate over the teaching of values in public schools. 

 

 Not only does ‘government through freedom’ involve paradoxical relations of 

 power, but also, the effects of such government are not predictable. As Rose 

 observes, it ‘… multiplies the points at which the citizen has to play his or her parts 

 in the games that govern him. And, in doing so, it also multiplies the points at 

 which citizens are able to refuse, contest, challenge those demands that are placed 

 upon them.’ (1999a, xxiii) Where do these insights lead us in terms of the argument 

 that increased responsibility should inspire heightened responsivity to others and 

 to a stronger sense of mutuality? I think to an open-minded scepticism. The 

 scepticism is drawn from the many reasons provided that cast doubt on the 

 capacity of increased responsibility to decrease public resentment. The need for 

 open-mindedness is encouraged by the recognition that the enactment of the 

 politics of responsibility, or of  ‘government though freedom’ is an unstable, 

 uncertain process. In this, there is scope for people to rethink and perform the 

 spaces of responsibility differently, to refuse the juridical and the disciplinary. They 

 might for example insist on taking responsibility for a past they did not physically

 Indigenous Australians.  

 

 “The subject” of responsibility 

 

 Underlying all perspectives on responsibility are assumptions, or occasionally 

 explicit arguments, about what being responsible means. Conventionally, 

 responsibility is understood as being accountable, as a rational phenomenon as a 

 property of the subject who enacts, or fails to enact, it. It is something that may be 

 chosen, avoided, demanded. It is a quality or an ethical orientation that is distinct 

 from its performance. Although Latham is a leader in contemporary policy debates 

 about responsibility, his understanding of the concept, and of what it means to be a 

 responsible person is utterly conventional and rather limited. He provides some 

 discussion about who is responsible for what and to what degree but these are 

 largely quantitative questions. When he fleshes out his use of responsibility in 

 speeches and writings he presents the issues as stark and obvious - people either 

 choose responsibility or they refuse it.. His tone varies from admonitory to 

 downright brutish. Responsibility is being accountable for your own behaviour. 

 And if you are not, then the state must intervene.  

 

 Responsible parents make sure their kids go to school, that they know where they 

 are at night (2004b). If they do not exercise their responsibilities they should be 

 subject to an imposed ‘parental responsibility contract.’ (2004b, 2) Responsible 

 people ‘work hard’, ‘study hard’, look for work if they are unemployed. (2004b, 1) 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 22

 Responsible people are decent hard working folk and they are with the Labor 

 tradition: ‘Our early leaders such as Curtin and Chifley, had no time for indecency 

 and irresponsibility.’ (2003, 26) And they do not participate in action groups in 

 support for asylum seekers: ‘The first priority for a just society is to help needy 

 people within the collective boundaries of the law. The first priority of …[Labor for 

 Refugees]… is to find excuses for people who break the law.’ (as quoted in Grattan 

 & Banham 2002, News 4) 

 

 At issue here is not whether Latham is right or wrong in his emphatic 

 pronouncements on responsibility but whether his approach to responsibility is 

 compatible with the facilitation of civic revival and the new mutuality that he so 

 desires. It is possible that his approach would foster a new mutuality but whether it 

 would be quite the mutuality he is after is another matter. If responsibility is 

 energised juridically and held together through the logic of a social contract and 

 norms of propriety, then regimes of surveillance and discipline will be required. 

 Rather than stimulating responsiveness, an innovative mutuality, an opening up to 

 different others, it is likely to produce closure around established identities and 

 exclusionary norms of conduct and a desire for  sociocultural police.  

 

 Latham illustrates no awareness of debates about responsibility and collective life 

 outside ‘Third Way’ concerns and his own electoral preoccupations. Further, he 

 makes no attempt to consider his understanding of responsibility in light of the 

 significant interest in responsibility that others in Australia have expressed in 

 relation to such areas as reconciliation and refugee policy. This is not particularly 

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 23

 strange as he is often hostile to the politics or political insights of ‘new’ social 

 movements that he frequently, and inaccurately reduces to ‘identity politics’. He 

 believes that they foster resentment and are too abstract and preoccupied with 

 symbols. (Latham 2003; Johnson 2003) However, as these alternative public calls for 

 responsibility explicitly link responsibility with responsivity and the rethinking of 

 collective identity, it is a significant omission. It impoverishes his capacity to fully 

 apprehend the politics of arguing for responsibility. Such apprehension is not 

 without precedent in the history of the Labor Party. Most notably, it was central to 

 Paul Keating’s famous ‘Redfern Park speech’ that launched the International Year 

 for the World’s Indigenous People in 1992 (in Ryan ed. 1995, 227-231).  

 

 So what is Latham missing that he might gain through a broader consideration of 

 responsibility? (Which is not to discount that the reverse also could be true - that 

 Latham’s perspective may offer critical purchase in analysing those other 

 approaches.) The social movements referred to above, and the associated theoretical 

 literature challenges us to think about responsibility outside the domains of the 

 juridical and the individual. They emphasise the affective dimensions of 

 responsibility, sociality and community. (see Gatens and Lloyd 1999; Gaita 1999; 

 Rossiter 2002; Healy et al eds 2003). Further, they do not take responsibility to be a 

 self-evident given, an individual practice contained within the logic of possessory 

 relations. In particular, these more philosophical writing problematise “the subject” 

 of responsibility and illustrate that responsibility is not something a pre-existing 

 individual has or does, but rather, is one of the paths through which subjects are 

 formed. (Gatens and Lloyd 1999, Rossiter 2002)   

   Penny Rossiter: The Politics of Responsibility 

  Page 24

 

 In Latham’s argument about responsibility and mutuality there is a leap from the 

 responsible individual (person, institution, corporation) to the responsive society. 

 To put it crudely, he believes that if there is a lot of responsibility present in 

 different locations that this will produce mutual respect and recognition: ‘I am 

 responsible, I can see that you are responsible therefore, we have a connection, a 

 basis for mutual respect’. However, once we factor in the lack of equivalence of 

 different kinds of responsibility and between differently positioned subjects of 

 responsibility, the ‘natural’ emergence of revivified sociality does not seem likely. 

 Instead, we might think of sociality as the process through which responsibility and 

 a greater responsivity to different others may be constituted. In this process the 

 responsible ‘I’ does not precede the responsible ‘we’. They are mutually constitutive 

 and responsibility is not the foundation of mutuality, mutuality is the dynamic 

 through which responsibility, or responsivity, may  be an outcome. This ‘mutuality’ 

 will inevitably be conflict ridden, and should be; for it involves the most 

 challenging tasks of negotiating relations of identity and difference and the 

 elaboration of how ‘we’ imagine ourselves and how we would like to collectively 

 live together in the 21st century. Although Latham is frequently scathing about 

 identity politics, ‘abstract’ intellectuals, and (like John Howard) what is seen as a 

 preoccupation with ‘symbolic’ rather than pragmatic concerns (see Latham 2003, 

 especially parts 1 and 2) he might find that there is much to gain through engaging 

 the literature on responsibility produced by these social movements and ‘abstract 

 intellectuals’.

 Conclusion 

 

 The idea that an intensification of ‘all-round’ responsibility is imperative as 

 Australians ease themselves into the uncertainties of early 21st century life and try 

 and establish new modes of mutuality suited to the challenges of the present is, in 

 some ways, an attractive one. However, it all depends on what is meant by 

 ‘responsibility’, ‘all-round’ and ‘mutuality’ and how the ‘challenges of the present’ 

 are understood. As this paper has demonstrated, the argument advanced by Mark 

 Latham for increased responsibility, in the hope that an enhanced mutuality and 

 civic renewal will result, is riddled with problems. The accentuation of individual 

 responsibility does not necessarily lead to positive outcomes in terms of social trust, 

 responsiveness to others and so on. The burdens of individual responsibility have 

 become so acute that intensification of responsibility risks stimulating resentment, 

 disregard or hostility to others and the loss of social trust and empathy. At the same 

 time though, responsibility for self, and to others, may be a vital communal 

 aspiration, an ethical imperative for how we may live together in heterogeneity, 

 with difference and even, in conflict.
