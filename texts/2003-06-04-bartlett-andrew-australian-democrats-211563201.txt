 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     June 4, 2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                                    03/402                  

 

 Sinister Raids To Link Refugees to Terrorism   

 The Australian Federal Police raids on the homes of Iranian families in three States was a sinister  move to demonise refugees and refugee advocates by linking them to terrorist threats, the  Australian Democrats said today.    

 Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said: “At a time when refugees are  under unprecedented pressure and are being threatened with deportation back to a regime with one  of the worst human rights records in the world, the Howard Government is again deliberately  demonising these people.   

 “There is a very sinister appearance to the AFP raids.   

 “The raids are based on evidence including links with the Refugee Action Collective and the Iranian  Refugee Association of Queensland.   

 “Making these links is outrageous and it highlights the Government’s continual attempts to link  refugees and their advocates to terrorism.   

 “Iranians in detention are being threatened with deportation to Iran, while their supporters in the  community are being subjected to dawn police raids.”
