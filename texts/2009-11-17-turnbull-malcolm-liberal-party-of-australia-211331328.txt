 TURNBULL DOORSTOP - KEVIN RUDD’S FAILED BORDER PROTECTION  POLICIES, PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Mr Rudd has got to come clean and tell us what other special deals he has offered the remaining 56 asylum 

 seekers on the Oceanic Viking. Yesterday and last week, he said the 22 who left the vessel had not been offered 

 any preferential deal. He said that again and again. But the text of the written offer from the Government itself 

 demonstrates that it is a preferential deal because it offers any of those asylum seekers who have been 

 determined by the UN High Commission on Refugees to be refugees, it offers them resettlement within four to six 

 weeks.  

 Now there are thousands of refugees in Indonesia and no others are being guaranteed resettlement in Australia 

 within four to six weeks. So it is absolutely plain it is a preferential deal and Mr Rudd’s attempt to say it isn’t is 

 completely and utterly unconvincing and lacking in all credibility. And of course…  

 QUESTION:  

 Is it still your view that he misled the House?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well saying that a deal which is clearly preferential is not preferential is plainly misleading. There is no question 

 about that. It is like saying black is white. Mr Rudd seems to have the capacity to look you in the eye and say 

 something that is patently wrong, patently false. The fact is it is a preferential deal, and if it were not a preferential 

 deal then every other asylum seeker in the same situation in Indonesia would have access to the same 

 guarantee of resettlement. That is plainly not the case.  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull, can I just clarify - yesterday we were taking your comments to mean that Mr Rudd misled the House 

 because he had said no and no to you, and then come back and clarified the record about his staff being on that 

 committee. Is that what you were accusing Mr Rudd of having misled the House on?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 No, if you see what I said yesterday, I was quite clear about it. He has misled the House, he has misled all 

 Australians by saying a clearly preferential special deal was not preferential. His statement that he did not know 

 about the… well, if we go back to it, we asked him whether he knew about the special deal and whether he 

 approved it. He said he did not know about it in advance and he did not approve it. He then came back half an 

 hour later and said that it had in fact been approved by a Cabinet subcommittee on which sat members of his 

 own staff.  

 Now, as I said yesterday, I suppose it is possible that this 24-hour-a-day workaholic, said to be a control freak, 

 was not told by his staff about the offer being made. I can’t say that without smiling because it seems so 

 incredible - and you are all smiling too - and we read today that the minutes of the Cabinet Committee were 

 circulated to all ministers including the Prime Minister immediately after the meeting.  

 So look, it strains credulity but we will see. No doubt the Prime Minister will have more to say about it but…  

 QUESTION:  

 And you’re confident you didn’t overreach again?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 The only charge of misleading that I have made against the Prime Minister relates to his claim that a preferential 

 deal was not preferential. As I said yesterday, there is a very - what I would call - low level of possibility that 

 such a momentous decision would have been made by members of the Prime Minister’s staff without discussing 

 it with him, but we will let the Prime Minister explain that. Perhaps more events will come out.  

 Can I just say this, the other thing we have to bear in mind in terms of events that have occurred in the last 24 

 hours, we have seen yet another boat arrive so “another boat, another policy failure” to quote Julia Gillard. We 

 are now up to 51 boats and over 2,200 arrivals.  

 The last minute cancellation of the President of Indonesia’s visit is an extraordinary slap in the face for Kevin 

 Rudd and Kevin Rudd’s claims to be the great Asia-Pacific diplomat. This is an extraordinary event for an 

 Indonesian President having made a commitment to come to Australia to speak to the Parliament to then at the 

 last minute cancel it and all of us saw on television the body language between them at the APEC summit. Our 

 relations with Indonesia are clearly very strained and they are strained because of Kevin Rudd’s colossal failure 

 of policy and his failure to manage effectively our relationship with our largest and closest neighbour.  

 QUESTION:  

 On credibility, Government MPs have come out saying that there had been no confirmation of a visit by SBY. 

 Does that sound credible to you?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 That doesn’t sound credible to me and I don’t think that will withstand a great deal of scrutiny.  

 QUESTION:  

 Do you have information…  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well you have only got to see that it was confirmed by the Indonesian Government and I think there are many 

 people in this city that know that the meeting, the visit was confirmed and was planned and was expected.  

 QUESTION:  

 Does it worry you that none of these colossal policy failures, as you call them, seem to be resonating that much 

 with the Australian people if today’s poll is to be believed?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 If I paid as much attention to the polls as you do, I wouldn’t have any time to think about anything else.  

 QUESTION:  

 But it is worrying that voters aren’t… they are still sticking behind Labor even though this is such a damaging 

 issue for them.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 The voters will form their own judgments and they will make their decision at the time of the election. The simple 

 fact of the matter is this - the object of Australia’s border protection policy with respect to asylum seekers is to 

 stamp out people smuggling and prevent, as far as possible, the unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers into our 

 waters. Mr Rudd says that is the object of his policy. It is the object of every government’s policy. By that 

 measure, his policy has been a colossal failure. It is about time he owned up to that failure, conceded the 

 consequence of his unpicking the border protection policies of the previous government that had been effective 

 and then, for him, having admitted that failure to then tell us how he is going to rectify it.  

 Thanks very much.
