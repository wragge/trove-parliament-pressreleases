 1. the responses of DIMIA, DFAT, AGD and their respective  Ministers to Mr Chen Yonglin’s approaches or requests to the  Australian Government for asylum and/or a protection visa 

 1. the application of the Migration Act 1958, its regulations and  guidelines concerning the maintenance of confidentiality for any  applicants for territorial asylum and/or protection visa by DIMIA,  DFAT and their respective Ministers 

 1. the involvement of DFAT and the Minister in the deportation,  search and discovery of Vivian Solon, and:
