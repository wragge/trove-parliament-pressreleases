 Opposition's plan for new Nauru revealed 

 Tuesday, 2 February 2010 

 The Liberal Party has today revealed plans to reintroduce the disgraced  Pacific solution to detain asylum seekers. 

 In a radio interview with 2GB, the Opposition's immigration spokesman, Scott  Morrison, said: 

 ‘We have no problem with finding alternative offshore detention arrangements,  whether that's in another country or within another excised Australian territory.  The government has said no to that. I mean, that's what they should have  been doing for the last six months when they knew that the boats were  surging. They should have been looking for an alternative offshore  destination, as we did - we had Nauru and Manus.’ 

 Under John Howard's so-called Pacific solution, 1637 people - including 452  children - were packed off to Nauru and Manus Island, where the average  length of stay was 501 days or approximately one and a third years. The  longest length of stay was 1958 days - more than five years. 

 Of the 1637 people detained in the Nauru and Manus facilities, 1153 or 70 per  cent were ultimately resettled in Australia or other countries. Of those, 705  were resettled in Australia. 

 The Howard government's Pacific solution was condemned internationally and  did nothing to foster regional co-operation on people smuggling or promote  international co-operation on providing protection to refugees. 

 The UNHCR expressed concerns that the Pacific solution detracted from  Australia's international responsibilities in its submission to the Senate Legal  and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Migration Amendment  (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill. 

 ‘Offshore processing on Nauru, introduced by Australia in October 2001 …  has resulted in prolonged detention-like situations of asylum-seekers and  refugees alike, as well as extended separation of families. The practice is also  known by UNHCR to have contributed to serious mental health problems.’ 

 The Pacific solution was a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise  introduced on the eve of a federal election by the Howard government. 

 The Rudd Government pledged to dismantle the Pacific solution. It has been  done and there is no intention to return to that shameful period.
