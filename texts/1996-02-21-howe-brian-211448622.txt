 COALITION'S $40 MILLION CUT WILL INCREASE  YOUTH HOMELESSNESS - HOWE

 The Coalition's $8 million experiment on youth homelessness pales Into  insignificance beside Labor’s comprehensive programs In this area, and the  Coalition’s draconian cuts to unemployment benefits. These cuts will dramatically  increase poverty and homelessness amongst disadvantaged young people, the  Federal Minister for Housing and Regional Development, Brian Howe said today.

 " The Coalition cannot save $118 million on unemployment benefits unless they cut  25% of the unemployed or 200,000 people off benefits for six weeks every year.

 " Young people 16 - 25 years old constitute 37.5% of this group.

 " Over 74,000 young people will be thrown off unemployment benefits for 6 weeks  or more as a result of the Coalition cuts.

 " These young people will lose over $40 million in payments. This Is over 5 times  the cost of the Coalition’s minimal program. These payments are absolutely critical  to avoiding family breakdown, poverty and homelessness.

 " In contrast, the $4 million per year offered by the Coalition for a youth  homelessness pilot is mere chicken feed. It provides no real support for  young people. It Is a poor policy response to a complex problem which will  be worsened by the Coalition's policies.

 " This is a cruel attack on our most disadvantaged young people. In contrast to the  Coalition's "pilot" program, Labor lias a comprehensive strategy to support  homeless young people:

 â¢ the introduction of the independant Homeless rate on the Youth Training  Allowance currently at $116 per week.

 â¢ the extension of rent assistance to young unemployed people and real  increases in the level of their payments to $36 per week.

 «  the Introduction of a new $11 million Homeless Youth and Refugee Action  Program.

 â¢ a $?B million package to support homeless students Including a schools  allowance and case management assistance.

 â¢ the provision of $225 million over 4 years from 1995 to crisis  accommodation services for homeless young people.

 " In contrast, the Coalition has made no clear commitment

 " The Coalition's youth homelessness policy is a cruel hoax on young people, given  the harshness of their cuts.

 " Young people will not be fooled."
