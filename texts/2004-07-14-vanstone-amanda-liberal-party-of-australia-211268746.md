  Media Centre  Visas Opportunities for TPV Holders in Regional Australia 

  VPS 101/2004 

  The Minister Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone  said today she was surprised and disappointed to find claims in the media that all Temporary  Protection Visa holders employed as lower skilled farm workers would fail to qualify for  mainstream visas under the changes to announced yesterday. 

  The Government's intention in relation to TPV holders employed in regional and rural  Australia was made quite clear yesterday. 

  I said yesterday that I had asked the department to ensure that enabling regulations and policies are framed in a way that clearly recognises the contribution that many TPV holders are making in regional areas. I can confirm that this will include the contribution made by lower skilled workers. Minor modifications would be made to the selected visa criteria to enable TPV holders, with skills acceptable to Australian employers, who have settled in regional and rural Australia to be approved if they are sponsored by their employers. For example, it is expected that changes will be made to the definitions of skill requirements for Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme applicants so that if a person has worked for the sponsor for 12 months they would meet the skill requirements. As I said yesterday, the regulations to give effect to the Government's intention are being drafted and I anticipate that they will be place by the end of next month. I also said that I would be writing to TPV holders to inform them about the changes. It is unfortunate that people claiming to be acting in the best interests of the TPV holders have weighed into the public arena without bothering to seek informed advice from the Department. 14 July 2004 See: Index of Media Releases http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media-~ releases/mediaO4/~04 1 0 1. htm 20/08/2004
