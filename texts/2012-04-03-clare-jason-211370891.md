 MEDIA RELEASE

 ANOTHER BOAT ON THE BACK OF TONY ABBOTT’S  NEGATIVITY   

 Another asylum seeker boat was intercepted overnight - the 14th since Tony Abbott  rejected offshore processing to benefit his own political interests.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest boat - carrying 81 asylum seekers - was further  evidence of the cost of Tony Abbott’s negativity on border protection.   

 “The Government has always said that the boats will keep coming unless we have a  genuine deterrent in place to prevent these dangerous boat journeys,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “This latest boat shows that asylum seekers continue to risk their lives at sea. Let’s not  forget the hundreds of people who have died in recent times - we need offshore  processing to help ensure this does not happen again.   

 “The question for Mr Abbott is how many more boats have to arrive, how many more  lives risked, before he puts away his negativity, puts the national interest ahead of  political interest, and votes to allow for offshore processing?”   

 Mr Clare said the Government and the Coalition could work together to stop people  risking their lives, but it would require Tony Abbott to stop saying no.   

 “We should not forget what this is about - 200 people died when their boat sank near  Java before Christmas. Another 11 people died earlier this year off the coast of  Malaysia,” Mr Clare said.   

 “Stopping people from risking their lives by taking this dangerous journey is within our  grasp.   

 “It’s time Tony Abbott stopped saying no and voted to allow offshore processing in  Malaysia and Nauru.”
