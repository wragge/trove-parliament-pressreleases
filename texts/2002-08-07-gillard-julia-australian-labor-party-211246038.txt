 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 THE ‘PACIFIC SOLUTION’ FARCE: 23% OF THE TRUTH NOW REVEALED

 Yesterday’s announcement by the Acting Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Attorney-General Daryl Williams, that another planeload of refugees has arrived in Australia from Nauru courtesy of the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’ further highlights the costly and farcical nature of this policy.

 The latest announcement revealed that 56 people have been brought to Brisbane and given five year temporary protection visas.  Refugees who have arrived in Australia for permanent settlement under the ‘Pacific Solution’ now total 116.  Approvals for asylum seekers on both Manus Island and Nauru now total 514.  Therefore, 23 per cent of those approved so far have been brought to Australia for resettlement with the Government refusing to tell the truth about its plans for further arrivals.

 Last year, the Prime Minister, Minister Ruddock and Minister Downer repeatedly promised the Australian people that the so-called Pacific Solution would be a real solution and pledged that these asylum seekers would never come to Australia.

 Yesterday’s announcement proves that it is an unsustainable fiasco with Australia still retaining responsibility for the asylum seekers involved.

 After spending over $500 million all the Government has achieved is to delay the arrival of these asylum seekers from 2001 to 2002.

 Minister, come clean - how many asylum seekers will end up in Australia?  Don’t hide behind media releases issued in the evening, outlining how the Government is sneaking small groups of refugees into the country bit by bit despite pledges that they would not come to Australia.

 The Government should work with Labor to find a lasting comprehensive solution to the asylum seeker issue - a solution that is both tough on border security and compassionate.
