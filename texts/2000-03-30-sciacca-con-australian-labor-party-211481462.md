  Gay And Lesbian Immigration Task Force Annual General Meeting

  

  Con Sciacca - Shadow Minister for Immigration

  

  Address - Spring Hill, Brisbane - 30 March 2000

  

  Check Against Delivery

  

  Thank you for the opportunity to address your 
Annual General Meeting in my capacity as Shadow Minister for Immigration. 
The quality of speakers here tonight certainly underlines the importance 
and respect that the gay community in Brisbane and around Australia 
has fought hard to earn over the years.

  

  Let me start by reaffirming the Labor Party's 
support for the rights of the gay community and our commitment to removing 
discrimination in all of its forms from Government policy. 

  

  It is the aim of a Labor Government to remove 
discrimination, against not only the gay community but any group of 
people, being discriminated in terms of gender, sexual preference, colour, 
religion age or nationality. 

  

  Believe me there are plenty of examples of this 
sort of subtle and not so subtle discrimination not only within the 
immigration department but also throughout the Government.

  

  Before I touch on the subject of immigration 
policy and how it applies to the gay community, I want to give you a 
brief overview of the direction in which the Minister is steering his 
department and the new 'tough' values which are applied to all facets 
of immigration policy.

  

  Over the last year or so, Minister Ruddock has 
divested himself of any remaining layers of compassion when dealing 
with the challenged of his portfolio.

  

  Just to give you a few examples, late last year 
during Refugee Week he announced tough new measures designed to remove 
the right of permanent residence to genuine refugees entering Australia 
illegally - 

  

  This new initiative, introduced in a bid to deter 
people smugglers and illegal immigrants while supported by the Opposition, 
has not made any difference -as predicted- to the motivation of those 
attempting to flee their country and try their luck in Australia.

  

  The majority of illegal entrants that come from 
such countries as Afghanistan, Iraq and Albania and will no doubt be 
allowed to remain in Australia permanently following the expiry of their 
initial three year visa.

  

  The Minister's latest decision to freeze the 
granting of visas to those refugees living in UNHCR camps overseas, 
waiting to come to Australia legally under our humanitarian program, 
only acts to provide further motivation to people who can no longer 
wait under our refugee programs.

  

  Another recent example of this Minister's failure 
to accept the reality that his policies are damaging his own reputation 
and that of Australia as a generous and humanitarian nation; as well 
as hurting those people we are striving to protect, is his refusal to 
remove his Amnesty International badge from his lapel, in spite of the 
organisation publicly calling him to do so.

  

  I believe it is an affront to Amnesty International 
and their constituency to continue to wear their symbol, while introducing 
harsh policies in contravention to the organisation's charter.

  

  The last example I want to share with you is 
one that I believe you will particularly relate to as a community, which 
over the years has experienced discrimination for something that you 
have no control over.

  

  One of the major areas of complaint I receive 
about the Immigration Department, as I travel around Australia, is the 
inability of people from certain countries to visit Australia as tourists 
or join their families for special occasions.

  

  When assessing applications for short term visas, 
the Immigration Department uses the so called 'high risk factor list 
of countries' to determine the likelihood of a person overstaying their 
visa.

  

  Once a tool used in conjunction with other criteria, 
this list has now been expanded and, its reliance by some officers of 
the Immigration department has reached almost paranoid levels 

  

  This list of countries whose people are considered 
to be at high risk of visa overstay holds quite a few surprises. I accept 
the need for us to safeguard the integrity of our borders. Having said 
that, however, I believe the overzealous use of this list has become 
discriminatory and highly unfair.

  

  Just to give you a few examples, those who attract 
suspicion when applying for a visitor's visa or apply to migrate to 
Australia include:

  

  â¢ Greek males ages 20-39 + 60 years and above 

  â¢ Greek females 20 -29 + 50 and above 

  â¢ Lebanese males and females from the age of 
20 onwards. 

  

  And the list goes on to include another 41 countries, 
including Chile, Croatia, Egypt, India, Israel, Peru, Poland, Turkey 
and so on.

  

  I have already given a commitment that this list 
will be reassessed and its usage reviewed as a matter of priority when 
Labor is returned to Government. 

  

  When we start to formally categorise people as 
undesirables, as it is done on this list, it is just a short step towards 
openly discriminating based on all sorts of criteria.

  

  In terms of immigration policy and its specific 
application to the rights of same sex couples, I don't have to remind 
you that it was the Labor Government that introduced the Interdependency 
visa class in 1991.

  

  Until then, same sex couples were forced to appeal 
to the Minister for Immigration to exercise his discretion on compassionate 
grounds in order for visas to be granted. The Labor Party believed, 
as it does now that rules of equality have to be legislated and people 
should not be left to the mercy of whatever prejudices a Minister may 
have.

  

  As a lawyer, I strongly believe that each case 
should be processed and dealt with within a framework of due process 
of law, not with a tick of a pen from an individual.

  

  Furthermore, the introduction of a formal visa 
subclass, enabled applicants access to administrative review of any 
decision based on merit.

  

  Indeed, merits review for interdependency visa 
applications has now been introduced with the passing of the Migration 
Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1999, which Labor supported.

  

  I understand, that your community's main concern 
within Immigration Law, is that there are currently no provisions by 
which a person who has applied to migrate to Australia as part of the 
skilled or business categories can include their same sex partner on 
the same application, and as a member of a family unit.

  

  In response to a Question on Notice on 31 October 
1996 from then Shadow Minister for Immigration, Duncan Kerr, Minister 
Ruddock stated that:

  

  â¢ The Government does not consider it necessary 
or appropriate at this time to alter the definition of "family 
unit" in the Migration Regulations to include a person in a same-sex 
relationship with an applicant for migration the same-sex partner of 
an applicant for migration must apply for a visa in their own right 
if they wish to join their partner in Australia. 

  

  I have been saying publicly now for over a year 
that it is very hard to expect young, skilled people to migrate to Australia, 
share their skills and make a worthwhile contribution to their new Country, 
if you prevent their families and loved ones from joining them.

  

  In conclusion, the problems you face in terms 
of being discriminated against in society and indeed often within a 
bureaucracy that still works with an anachronistic set of rules are 
not isolated to the gay community. 

  

  Under the Howard Government, a new ethos has 
developed where the bottom line is the ultimate judge. There is a general 
lack of understanding and compassion for anyone who does not fit within 
the parameters of 'mainstream Australia', be they refugees, the disabled, 
the needy or in your case, gays and lesbians.

  

  This is a very worrying trend and one that the 
Labor Party will actively tackle in Government. In the end, it is the 
Country's leaders that have to set the standards and provide the right 
messages to the community.

  

  Leaders influence opinions -it is a fact- and 
leaders have the responsibility to educate and guide their constituents 
towards tolerance, understanding and compassion.
