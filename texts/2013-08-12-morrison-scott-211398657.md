 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 Since the Prime Minister announced his PNG Solution some three weeks ago,  there’ve been 2,274 people who have turned up on 33 boats.  Just in case  people thought they were slowing, let me run through what’s happened in August  in the first ten days. There was a boat on 1 August, there were two boats on 2  August, there was a boat on 3 August, there were three boats on 4 August, there  was a boat on 6 August, on the 7th, on the 8th, there were three on 9 August and  there were two on 10 August - so just under 800 people over those first ten days  - 15 boats, 10 days of August.  Now, on two of those occasions, we had vessels  that were coming through the Torres Strait. One of the most serious things about  Kevin Rudd’s failures on our borders is every time Labor comes up with a  solution, they fail to think it through and as a result, we always end up in a worse  situation after one of Kevin Rudd’s solutions than we did when we started out.   And in this case, what he has done is not only does our border crisis continue -  coming into Ashmore islands, coming across to Christmas Island, coming into the  Cocos and Keeling Islands - Kevin Rudd’s brilliant idea has just opened up  another front on the Torres Strait with our Northern exposure. 

 Now, along the Torres Strait, we are dealing with our most porous border. This is  an area where there were some more than 50,000 movements of people during  the last reported year. There are a lot of people moving backwards and forth over  a very diverse area and the assets we have in place, up in that part of Australia,  are very thin on the ground. They’re a small number of movement officers who  are up there from the Department of Immigration that work only during the day,  obviously and then we have airports up there where there is no security.  We  have a very small fleet of quite small patrol vessels operating out of Customs and  Border Protection and the vast majority of the presence, whether it’s AFP or  others, are back there on Thursday Island, as was relayed to me again this  morning by Warren Entsch, the Liberal Member for Leichardt.      

 All of this shows that Kevin Rudd’s big bold bluff of an election fix when it comes  to PNG is just, simply, at this stage, starting to point the way to another route into  Australia. And when Campbell Newman highlighted this several weeks ago, in  this very room, the Minister for Immigration dismissed him as hysterical and  derided the comments that he was making. Now, that’s very typical of this  Minister and of this Government. They can never see the gaping holes in their  own policies. That’s why they always unravel. Whether it was the Malaysian  people swap, the East Timor farce - all of these things and now the PNG  arrangement - they can never see the holes in their own policies, they never  want to hear about the holes in their own policies and that’s why they always  unravel at the end of the day.    

 So despite the fact that that Minister stood in this room claiming a “mission  accomplished” moment, last week, when he was sprouting about intelligence in  this room, it’s clear that the vessels are continuing to arrive.  We won’t know the  ultimate outcome of the bluff effect for some weeks if not months but the real  effect comes from policies that you can implement. This Minister has no  resettlement plans for people in Papua New Guinea. There are no arrangements  - how long they’ll be paid welfare benefits and pensions, what healthcare they’ll  get, what land they will live on, what housing they’ll have access to and almost  every single day, we see people from Papua New Guinea coming out and  highlighting the very real practical problems of what Kevin Rudd has announced.      

 One of the clear implications of what he announced is he is opening up our most  porous border - through the Torres Strait - and that is just another example of  how Kevin Rudd never thinks these things through past the press conference. It’s  great to have Senator Brandis, the Senior Senator for Queensland with me and  also the Shadow Attorney-General, and he’s here to make some remarks,  particularly as a Queenslander.    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:          

 Thank you very much indeed, Scott. The decision of Mr Rudd and Mr Burke to  enter into an arrangement with Papua New Guinea was always fraught with the 

 risk that it would open up a new pathway into Australia for illegal entrants through  the Torres Strait and that has become a matter of increasing alarm in my state,  Queensland, as evidenced from this morning’s Courier Mail headline: “Northern  Exposure”. I have spoken earlier this morning with the Premier Campbell  Newman who has been in a cabinet meeting in Brisbane all morning and he tells  me that he and his government are deeply concerned that, as a result of Mr  Rudd’s poorly thought-through decision, what they have done is made  Queensland the new frontline in the struggle against the people smugglers and  as Scott Morrison has said, made Torres Strait, Australia’s most porous border,  the new pathway into Australia for illegal entrants travelling via New Guinea.    

 Now, you might think that the term “Australia’s most porous border” is one that  only the Coalition is using but that term was originally used, when he was  Premier of Queensland, by Mr Beattie who criticised the government of John  Howard for not paying sufficient attention to the defence of Torres Strait as  Australia’s most porous border - Mr Beattie’s words when he was the Premier of  Queensland, not Scott Morrison’s or mine. And yet, during the life of this Labor  Government - a government which Mr Beattie now aspires to become a member  of - the deployment of Commonwealth Government assets along the Torres  Strait has been reduced, not increased. If Mr Peter Beattie is to be taken  seriously as somebody who wants to represent the interests of Queensland  constituents in the Commonwealth Parliament, it’s for him to say what he’s going  to do about the fact that his leader, Mr Rudd, has opened up the borders of  Queensland to illegal entrants and people smugglers.    

 Another point should be made as well. Once people cross from New Guinea to  the Torres Strait Islands, which, of course, are Australian territory - a passage  that could almost be made on foot at low tide to the northernmost lying Torres  Strait islands - then they are in Australia, for all purposes.  There is actually an  air service between Horn Island - one of the largest of the Torres Strait Islands -  and Cairns, for which people who make their way from New Guinea to the Torres  Strait Islands require no passport.  Once they make their way from New Guinea  to the Torres Strait Islands, they are in Australia for all purposes, are free to  travel to the mainland and from the mainland to debouch into a diaspora within  Australia.  So potentially, Mr Rudd’s non-solution makes the problem of securing  our borders and of detection of those people who cross those borders, worse  rather than better.      

 I also, this morning, spoke to my colleague, Ewen Jones, the Member for  Herbert.  His constituency comprises, largely, the City of Townsville and he  reports to me that, among his constituents and people in Townsville this morning,  there is great alarm that Mr Rudd’s new border protection policy has opened up  North Queensland as a place of entry for illegal immigrants and as a new place  for the people smugglers to offer them as a place of disembarkation.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 

 I should also note that, in talking to Warren Entsch today as well, the Federal  Government used to provide funding support to Queensland Health to operate  the clinics up through the Torres Strait and Warren advises me that that funding  has been pulled back over the last few years, which obviously raises issues.  But  the demonstration that this policy was not thought through was the absence of  any consultation, either with the Queensland Government or those running our  border operations up through that region, about the potential consequences of  settling what the Government claims will be thousands of people in Papua New  Guinea.  They just don’t think it through.    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:          

 Well, if I can add to that, Scott. The lack of consultation was confirmed to me in  the conversation I recently had with the Premier, Campbell Newman. There was  before, and there has been since, no consultation or engagement by the Federal  Government with the Queensland Government. The only engagement between  the Federal Government and the Queensland Government was when Mr Burke,  as Scott has said, stood in this room and ridiculed the concerns of the Premier of  Queensland. Those concerns have now come to fruition and it’s a bit like a  leak. Once you spring a leak, it’s not very long before it’s a torrent. That is what  people in Queensland are fearful of today.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 And we saw that at Christmas Island. If you go back many years, after the border  arrangements were changed, which Kevin Rudd changed back in 2008, it was  just a few boats at first, testing out what would happen and then more boats  came and more boats came and now we’ve had over 800 vessels turn up and  over 50,000 people as a result of that decision. Kevin Rudd didn’t think it would  have that impact then, Tony Burke doesn’t think it would have the impact on the  Torres Strait now. We all know they don’t think it through and the consequences  surely follow. Any questions?    

 QUESTION:    

 What are the statistics, and what do you know about boat arrivals from the Torres  Strait Islands to Queensland? Are there ten this month?  How many were there  last month and what statistics are there over a longer period of time?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 Well, we’re only just now starting to see that come through, as I said -     

 QUESTION:    

 So there haven’t been any arrivals from the Torres Strait before then?      

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 No, there was a Syrian that had come through earlier and it does happen  occasionally but not very, very often.    

 QUESTION:    

 How do you know it’s going to happen very often because of these changes?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 As I’ve just said, we saw the same - what I’m saying is we saw the same thing  happen back at Christmas Island four or five years ago.  There were only a  couple at first and what we -    

 QUESTION:    

 So you’re speculating about the future?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 I think it’s a fair - we’ve got a pretty good form when it comes to our speculation  and our forecasts on what Labor’s failures mean on our borders. I remember four  years ago, when I first came into this portfolio and I talked about the impact on  Christmas Island, about rising levels of arrivals and I said that the place could be  subject to riots. Now, I was told I was hysterical then and we all know what  happened on Christmas Island, we all know what happened at Villawood, we all  know what happened on Nauru and the boats have continued to come as a result  of Labor’s failures. There is clear form of this Government not thinking through  the consequences of their policy decisions and we’ve seen it again on this  occasion. And so, on the other side of the election, what you can expect is Labor  to play to form and their form is it all unravels and turns to custard.    

 GEORGE BRANDIS:          

 If I may add to Scott’s remarks - can I just make this further point that when Mr  Rudd announced his arrangement with the Prime Minister of New Guinea, Mr  O’Neill, some three weeks ago, he made it clear that those taken to Manus Island  would not be required to stay at Manus Island - that there would be other places  in New Guinea where they could go. There is no difficulty at all, because of the  porousness of the border, in people coming from the southern shores of New  Guinea onto the northernmost-lying Torres Strait Islands and then from there to  Horn Island where they can catch a plan to Cairns with no further scrutiny.  What  we know is that people smugglers will always test the weak points in the system 

 and what Kevin Rudd has done, by allowing these people carte blanche to use  New Guinea now as a jumping off point to Australia, is he has created a new  weak point at one of our most porous borders.    

 QUESTION:   

 And what you’re saying is that there’s going to be thousands and thousands and  thousands -     

 GEORGE BRANDIS:          

 That’s what happened last time.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:      

 Well this is what has happened. At this point, the Government hasn’t resettled  anyone in Papua New Guinea and potentially, the only defence against this  happening is the PNG arrangement, when it comes to resettlement, falling over  and there’s a real likelihood that that will occur. I mean, we’re already seeing the  reactions in Papua New Guinea about the very real challenges of resettling  people in Papua New Guinea.  But the Government isn’t planning on that  basis; the Government is planning on the basis of thousands of people being  resettled in Papua New Guinea and if you make that assumption, then you really  have to understand that that opens up our most porous border.  And it’s being  tested now, the weaknesses are being identified and night follows day when it  comes to the failures of this Government on border protection - it always does.   Thanks for your time.
