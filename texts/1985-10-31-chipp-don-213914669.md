 PRESSRELEASE <3 THE SENATE

 P.R. NO. 85/280 CANBERRA 31 OCTOBER 1985

 CHIPP: HURFORD TRYING TO PRESSURE DORS COMMITTEE ON IRIAN JAYAN REFUGEES

 Senator Don Chipp, Leader of the Australian Democrats, today  criticised Mr Hurford for attempting to pressure the 

 Determinations of Refugee Status (DORS) Committee into reversing  its decision on the five Irian Jayan refugees.

 "This Committee which has representatives from.the Departments of  Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Prime Minister and Cabinet as  well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has  spent months deciding that these people are genuine refugees. 

 Clearly,  Mr Hurford would have preferred the Committee to have  found the other way, but to try to make the Committee look at the  question again, which is obviously what he is doing, is an 

 attempt to pressure the Committee into changing its mind.

 "What is the point of setting up such processes and procedures if  the Government won't, accept their findings? After all, the DORS  Committee was established by Government.

 "What Mr Hurford is really worried about, is that the case for  Australia taking these people' is much stronger now than before,  but Mr Hurford has said from the very beginning that under no  circumstances refugees or not, would Australia accept them.

 "It is absurd to suggest as Mr Hurford has, that these people  for their own benefit would be better off in places like 

 Austria,".Senator Chipp concluded.
