 SOVIET ATTACK

 In a stinging attack on the Soviet Union Liberal F r o n t b e n c h e r ,   Alan C a d m a n , said the Soviet regime in A f g h a n i s t a n  was the most   b a r b a r i c , inhumane and" brutal the world had seen.

 Addressing the A f g h anistan Freedom League in Sydney last night he   castigated the Soviet Union for its 6 year o c c u p a t i o n  of   A f g h a n i s t a n .

 "The Soviets have used booby trapped land m ines di s g u i s e d  as   snuff b o x e s , toys and soap which have m a m e d  and killed the   children who picked them up. â   _

 "There are little or no health care facilities available to the   majo r i t y  of the p opulation and infant m o r t a l i t y  is now at a rate   of 400 per 1000. -

 "Apart from reports of systematic torture being applied there are   no pris o n e r  of war camps as the 118,000-strong Soviet army simply   shoots resistent fighters upon c a p t u r e .

 "A quarter of the Afghan population now live as refugees outside   the country. In addition 40,000 children (aged 5 years and   older) have been sent to Russia for re-education.

 "Amongst the damning r evelation of human rights v iolations are   included Soviet a ggression against the Afgh a n  people's food,   agriculture and housing, and Soviet bombing of funeral   processions.

 "All these facts are docum e n t e d  by special United Nations Human   Rights Commissioner, A u s t r i a n  Professor Felix Ermacora who argues   that "governments and representatives of international   organisations have an urgent responsibility to find ways and   means to ensure respect for and g uarantees of human rights  

 throughout the w o r l d " . r

 "The smiling Gorbachev speaking of peace excels the barbarism of  Stalin - a smiling face that hides a brutal murderer."

 22 DECEMBER 1985
