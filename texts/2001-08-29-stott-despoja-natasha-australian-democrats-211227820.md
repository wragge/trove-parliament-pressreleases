  Democrats Condemn Government’s Border  Protection Bill  The Australian Democrats have condemned the Government’s attempts to legalise its actions  (retrospectively) in the Border Protection Bill 2001. 

  The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said the treatment of the  asylum seekers on The Tampa and the crew of the Norwegian ship by the Australian Government  had been appalling. 

  “The Australian Democrats will oppose the Border Protection Sill 2001 on the grounds of process  and policy. The Government has rushed this Bill into both Houses of Parliament with no warning  and no consultation,” said Senator Stott Despoja. 

  “It is simply inappropriate to pass such a Bill in an emergency session of Parliament without  engaging in any consultation with the community and with other maritime nations. 

  “Laws should not be cobbled together in a matter of hours to cover the Government for actions it  has already taken onboard The Tampa. 

  “The Government has effectively closed Australia’s borders to prevent people, including pregnant  women and children, from applying for refugee status. 

  “In terms of policy, there are two basic objections to this Bill. The first is that it attempts to grant  arbitrary power to turn vessels away from Australian territory,” said Senator Stott Despoja. 

  “This is effectively a ban on refugees. Provided the Government can detect these boats, it could use  powers under this Bill to turn them away. Men, women and children fleeing terror and oppression  will be sent back in a display of outrageous callousness. 

  “The second is that it purports to prevent any person applying for refugee status from attempting to  access the courts to ensure that they have been dealt with in accordance with due process of law. 

  “This Bill proposes to make some extraordinary actions taken by the Government involving a  military operation against unarmed civilians not subject to judicial review. It is a fundamental  principle of law that actionby any officer of the State must be subject to review in the courts. 

  “The Australian Democrats simply cannot support this Bill. It is a repudiation of international law,  domestic law and of basic humanitarian standards,” concluded Senator Stott Despoj a.
