 TRANSCRIPT 

 Doorstop 

 Tangney electorate office, WA 

 12noon WST, 1 January 2003 

 Subject:  Detention centres, hoax call to National Security Hotline………………………e&oe   

 WILLIAMS: 

 Well, happy New Year to everybody.  Thank you for coming out.  I want to comment on the  incidents last night at the Villawood detention centre.  A group of detainees set fire to one of  the  compounds,  then  commandeered  a  staff  member’s  vehicle  and  sought  to  ram  through  a  

 gate.  The  intention  seems  to  have  been  to  affect  a  mass  escape.  Fortunately  the  centre   management had put in place some arrangements for additional security and the fire brigade  and the police arrived very quickly and between them they were able to thwart the attempted  escape  and  the  fires  were  quickly  put  out.  Those  who  are  responsible  have  been  segregated   and are liable for early removal. All of those involved have not had any claim for a protection  visa, they were there for other reasons like unlawfully employed, visa overstay and, in some 

 cases, character issues. 

 REPORTER: 

 What will happen to those people? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, hopefully the police will be able to identify those responsible to the point that they’ll  have evidence for a prosecution. If they’re prosecuted then they’ll be dealt with according to  law and, in due course, removed. 

 REPORTER: 

 There’s  a  big  picture  here,  though,  we’ve  had  a  lot  of  fires  right  across  Australia.  Is  that   sending some sort of message to the Australian government? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, I think the suggestion that I’ve heard made that this is an orchestrated set of events, I  think does not have any substantive evidence in support of it.  It seems more to be the case  that  once  an  incident  occurs  in  one  centre,  then  other  centres,  detainees  in  other  centres   follow.  But, no doubt the Federal Police in their investigations of the various incidents will  be able to determine whether there is any orchestration. 

 REPORTER: 

 Do you think the Government’s lost control of the detention centres? 

 

 

  2

 WILLIAMS:   

 Not  at  all.  I  think  it’s  impossible  to  rule  out  incidents  occurring,  particularly  where  the   detainees are determined to put pressure on the Government to change their view about their  right to stay.  But the Government has put in place additional measures, additional security,  taken further steps - searched the detainees in Woomera and Baxter - and at the moment the  centres all seem to be under control. 

 REPORTER: 

 Various  refugee  advocates  have,  want  an  inquiry  into  refugees  or  asylum  seekers  being   deported more quickly. Marion Le is one who’s said that, what do you think about this? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well,  I  don’t  think  the  Government  -  apart  from  anybody  else  -  wants  to  have  people  in   detention  and  not  removed  as  quickly  as  possible.   The  intention  of  the  Government  is  to   remove people as soon as they can. But it’s not always a straightforward case though, because  the  people  may  have  appeals  against  the  decision  to  refuse  a  visa,  there  may  be  identity   difficulties and, in some cases - a relatively small number of cases fortunately - the country  of origin has no arrangements in place for return of people. 

 REPORTER: 

 But  there  are  some  sections  of  the  Australian  community  that  really  think  you  should  be   taking a harder line with this group. 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, I think that most of the talkback radio that I’ve heard seems to be quite determined that  anybody who engages in criminal acts while in detention should simply be deported.  It would  be  nice  if  it  was  that  simple,  but  of  course  it’s  not.  Now,  can  I  say  something  about  the   refugee support groups. A number of representatives of refugee support groups have indicated  that  they  understand  why  detainees  are  engaging  in  these  criminal  acts,  and  few  -  if  any  -   have  actually  come  out  and  condemned  the  conduct of the detainees in  their  vandalism and   their  arson.  This,  I  think,  is  itself  to  be  condemned,  because  by  suggesting  that  there  is  an   understanding  of  the  reason  detainees  are  doing  what  they’re  doing  they’re,  in  fact,   encouraging them - suggesting that there is support out in the community.  And it encourages  the  detainees  to  engage  in  this  sort  activity  with  a  view  to  putting  pressure  on  the   Government.  The Government is going to resist any such pressure and we’re going to pursue  anybody who engages in criminal acts to the extent of the law as hard as possible. 

 REPORTER: 

 [inaudible question] 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well,  I  can’t  give  you  a  running  total,  but  the  …  Baxter  was  approximately  two  and  a  half  million dollars, Port Hedland was three million dollars, I think the … Christmas Island was  relatively  small  and  I’m  told  that  the  damage  at  Villawood  is  approximately  half  a  million   dollars. 

 REPORTER: 

 Are you in a crisis situation now with the damage and accommodation problems? 

 

 

 

  3

 WILLIAMS:   

 No, in each case the detainees can be accommodated in the remaining buildings at each of the  centres, there is no problem there.  There was something like forty accommodation places lost  at Villawood. 

 REPORTER: 

 Surely with events daily you can see that it’s reached a crisis point. 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, you have to look at each centre individually and in each case - at the present time - the  detainees are under control in the respective centres. 

 REPORTER: 

 Is it fair to describe the system as in crisis, though? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 I don’t think it’s appropriate to describe it as being in crisis.  Of course the Government is not  going to be keen to see any more incidents of this character. As I said, you can’t rule out the  possibility that there will be determined individuals within detention centres who will want to 

 take action to disrupt the centre and, in their view, put pressure on the Government. 

 REPORTER: 

 With this… 

 WILLIAMS:   

 The Government can only take appropriate security measures, bearing in mind that these are  not correctional facilities, they’re administrative detention centres. 

 REPORTER: 

 On another issue, with the case today - a big security operation following an alleged threat or  hoax to blow up New Year’s Eve celebrations at Fremantle.  And they were basically sparked  by the anti-terrorist ad. 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, I think there will always be the odd individual in the community who will believe it’s  funny to create a hoax. Regrettably this has occurred so soon after the start of the advertising  campaign. But, can I say, while anybody who produces false reports will be pursued and, if  possible, prosecuted, we don’t want to discourage anybody who has a what, in their, in good  faith,  they  believe  to  be  a  genuine  concern  from  ringing  the  hotline.   People  are  to  be   encouraged to report anything unusual and suspicious of the national security type of things. 

 REPORTER: 

 Do you view this situation as fairly serious? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 I don’t know all the details of the case. I understand the young man who’s pleaded guilty to  telephoning from a public phone box, warning of possible explosions of canisters of petrol on  New Year’s Eve, that resulted in a very extensive exercise in ascertaining, first, that it was a 

 hoax  and  then  identifying  the  offender.  And  people  who  engage  in  that  sort  of  activity,  I   think,  should  expect  to  be  prosecuted,  dealt  with  appropriately  under  the  law  and  should   expect to be paying compensation for the expense. 

  4

 It’s  not  only the  cost  of  the  inquiry  that  is  of  concern  when  hoaxes  are  perpetrated,  it’s the   diversion of the police and other emergency services from genuine cases that can give rise to  very serious concern. 

 REPORTER: 

 So, the Commonwealth will seek compensation from this person, will it? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, it’s mainly the State police, I think, who have incurred the cost and I would hope that  the State police would consider pursuing the offender for compensation. 

 REPORTER: 

 You would… 

 WILLIAMS:   

 One more question. 

 REPORTER: 

 Would you agree that any time that you put ads on TV with a toll-free hotline that you will  get people in the community who will misuse it? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, there will always be people who will abuse whatever system is put in place, I can only  hope  that  honest  people  are  not  discouraged  by  the  odd  individual  who  misbehaves  from   doing the right thing. 

 REPORTER: 

 Attorney-General, just  one  quick question from me.  Is  the  copycat  nature  of  the  fires  at  the   detention centres, the disturbances, have you had any thought of limiting access to telephones  or television or media at the centres? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, there is a range of possible measures presently under consideration by the Department.  Some  things  have  been  done  already.  There  already  is  a  limit  on  the  ability  of  detainees  to   access matches and cigarette lighters and other things like that.  The withdrawal of privileges  is certainly something that is under consideration in respect of those who misbehave. 

 REPORTER: 

 What  about  the  media  in  terms  of,  you  know,  them  finding  out  about  fires  and  being   encouraged to do the same? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Well, access to television and radio and newspapers are privileges in the detention centre, but  I’m not sure that that’s under consideration or is appropriate. 

 REPORTER: 

 Can I just ask about one other subject, a man by the name of Abu Quassey - I believe that’s  how you pronounce it - who was the people smuggler responsible for the SIEV X disaster, it  looks  like  the  Australian  authorities  might  have  missed  their  chance  to  get  him  from   Indonesia. 

 

 

  5

 WILLIAMS:   

 I can’t comment on that. You’ll have to refer any questions relating to that to Senator Ellison,  he’s responsible for extradition and law enforcement at the Commonwealth level. 

 REPORTER: 

 Can you tell us where Minister Ruddock is?  And, should he be away from his portfolio while  the detention centres are going up in smoke? 

 WILLIAMS:   

 Mr Ruddock is having a well-earned holiday, but he’s in contact with his office.
