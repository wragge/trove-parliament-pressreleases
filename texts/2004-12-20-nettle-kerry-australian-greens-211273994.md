 Senator Kerry Nettle   Senator for New South Wales    

 Bakhtiyaris face deportation for embarrassing  government  20th December 2004 

 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today condemned the actions of the  Government in taking the Bakhtiyari family back into detention and  threatening them with forced deportation to Pakistan.    

 "This case would be high farce if it weren't so tragic," Senator Nettle  said. "The Greens are calling for a compassionate approach to this  family's plight that can allow then to continue to live in the community  which has embraced them in Adelaide.    

 "The government poured huge resources into proving their misguided  hypothesis that the Bakhtiyaris are from Pakistan when all the credible  evidence indicates that they are Afghani.    

 "Mr Bakhtayri is a Hazara from central Afghanistan, whose family is  registered at the local mosque, whose brother is on the electoral roll in  Kabul, and whose youngest daughter was born in Australia - but the  government want to deport him to Pakistan.    

 "The government's stubborn desire to deport this family is at odds with  the total support from the local community for them to stay in  Australia.    

 "With all this family has been through the Minister should surely be  issuing a humanitarian visa rather than locking up children and  threatening to put then in handcuffs and deport them.    

 "The fact is that this family's high profile ordeal has embarrassed a  government who is keen to see the back of them as part of their war  on asylum seekers."
