 Gillard’s foreign affairs bungles continue 

 Thursday, 19 May 2011  

 Prime Minister Julia Gillard continues to compromise Australia’s key international relationships, with  Malaysia the latest country to be subject to bungling by this Labor government.  

 After the debacle of her “East Timor solution”, where she failed to properly consult with the  government of East Timor, it appears the Prime Minister has learned little in her attempts to engage in  diplomatic negotiations with our neighbours. 

 When Julia Gillard announced her new “deal” with the Prime Minister of Malaysia on 7 May she  claimed, "The truth is if you spend your money, you get on a boat, you risk your life, you don't get to  stay, you go to Malaysia, and you go to the back of the queue.” 

 It is now obvious the “Malaysian solution” was announced before any agreement had been finalised. 

 There are reports overnight that Malaysia's Home Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein has  said that asylum seekers who have arrived by boat since Julia Gillard’s announcement will not be  processed in Malaysia because no deal has been finalised. 

 The hapless Immigration Minister Chris Bowen has risked causing offence to the Malaysian  Government by contradicting the Home Minister and insinuating that the yet to be finalised agreement  will allow for the transfer of the recent boat arrivals. 

 The haste with which Ms Gillard announces publicly her discussions with regional leaders continues  to cause embarrassment. 

 The Prime Minister should refrain from international negotiations until she understands the norms that  govern relations with other countries including respecting the sovereign rights of the nations of our  region.
