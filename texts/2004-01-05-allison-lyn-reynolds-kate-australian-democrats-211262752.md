 ‘Stateless’ man should be released immediately   

 The  Australian  Democrats  have  called  on  the  Federal  Government  to  immediately  release  an   asylum seeker currently detained in Western Australia after a failed deportation attempt, which saw  him returned to Australia after two weeks in international limbo. 

 Legal  proceedings  were  today  lodged  in  the  Federal  Court  in  Adelaide  to  have  Edriss  Alsalih   released from detention in Perth, as he is effectively stateless with no country willing to accept him.  Mr Alsalih had previously spent almost three years in detention in Australia. 

 Refugee Advocacy Service of SA lawyer Deslie Billich today lodged a habeas corpus application to  have  Mr  Alsalih  released  from  detention  on  the  grounds  that  he  had  been  unlawfully  detained  in   Australia. 

 Mr Alsalih, who was born in Kuwait to Sudanese immigrant parents, was deported from Perth on  December  13  and  flown  to  South  Africa,  before  being  sent  to  Tanzania  and  then  back  to  South   Africa, after being refused entry to Sudan. Two weeks after he was first deported from Australia, he  was returned to Perth, where he again was placed in detention. 

 Democrats’ Refugee spokesperson Kate Reynolds MLC said the Federal Government had no other  option  but  to  release  Mr  Alsalih  from  detention,  as  the  courts  had  previously  ruled  that  asylum   seekers could not be detained indefinitely. 

 “The Federal Government has tried to remove Mr Alsalih and has failed. He has nowhere to go, and  no place to call home,” she said. 

 “Surely this Government has enough commonsense to realise that this man is stuck between a rock  and a hard place - he has no country to return to, and yet he cannot be detained for an indefinite  period of time. 

 “There is no other option - he has to be released.”
