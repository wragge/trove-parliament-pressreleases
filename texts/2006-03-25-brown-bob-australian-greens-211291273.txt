 Australia should confront Jakarta and pursue West Papuan  rights in the United Nations - Greens   

 25th Mar 06   

 "Australia should respond to Indonesia's demands that we break  international law protecting West Papuan refugees by taking the  issue of  West Papuan independence to the United Nations," Greens Leader  Senator Bob Brown said this morning.   

 He was responding to Jakarta's petulant withdrawal of its  ambassador.   

 "The Indonesian government's brutal crackdown on West Papua  which has more than 1,000 students currently hiding in the  rainforest near Jayapura, confronts human decency and the right of  West Papuans to independence.   

 "The Australian government should make it clear it will not accept  Jakarta's demands that UN conventions protecting West Papuan  refugees should be broken," said Senator Brown.
