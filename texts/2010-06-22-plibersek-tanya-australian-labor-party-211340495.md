 $310,000 for International Womens Day Centenary   

 22/06/2010   

 Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, has announced $310,000 to mark the  centenary of International Women's Day in 2011. 

 "8 March 2011 marks the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day and will be a  terrific opportunity for women and men to come together to reflect on what has been  achieved and the challenges ahead," Ms Plibersek said.  

 "The Government will support the Century by providing $100,000 to UNIFEM Australia to  help them coordinate, promote and conduct a range of events and activities across Australia,  in partnership with Government and the corporate sector. 

 "The funding will also enable UNIFEM to develop a series of resources, including a website  which will coordinate International Women's Day events around the country. 

 "In addition, each of the six National Women's Alliances will be provided with $35,000 each  to celebrate the centenary."  

 Speaking at the first forum of the new National Women's Alliances in Canberra, Ms Plibersek  said the funding will enable the Alliances to acknowledge and celebrate the contributions and  achievements of many women over the years. 

 "The Government encourages community organisations and women's groups across the  country to engage with UNIFEM in International Women's Day Centenary planning," Ms  Plibersek said.  

 "I look forward to hearing ideas from the community on how we can celebrate the fantastic  achievements of the past 100 years and inspire further progress for the next 100."  

 Ms Plibersek announced the establishment of six National Women's Alliances in March this  year. The Alliances are made up of more than 100 national women's organisations and  represent thousands of women across the nation.  

 Each alliance has a specific focus: economic security, equality rights, violence against  women, immigrant and refugee women, rural, and Indigenous women.
