  media release 

  Climate Resilient Australia: Hot air without a temperature limit  Hobart, Wednesday 20 November 2007  Australian Greens climate change  spokesperson, Senator Christine Milne, today said that the Coalition's climate policy, A Climate Resilient Australia, is nothing more than unscientific, uneconomic hot air in the  absence of a temperature limit or a short term emissions reduction target. 

  Senator Milne said "The one thing the Government has got right on climate change is  that, in Minister Macfarlane's words, 'our prosperity is threatened if our response to  climate change is misguided and driven by ideology'. 

  "But, as Australian voters now understand, it is the Government's response to climate  change which is utterly misguided and is driven by their anti-environmental ideology. 

  "The Howard Government's blinkered, unscientific climate response has seen them  refuse to even say how much global warming they are willing to risk, let alone set short  term emissions reduction targets such as the IPCC are calling for. 

  "Their refusal to accept the science has seen them deliberately undermine global climate  action and ignore the regional security implications of climate change including the plight  of climate refugees. At home, they have accelerated the development of new coal mines,  roads and logging operations, while driving our renewable energy industry offshore.  

  "Coming after 11 years of climate ostrichism, and with senior members of the  Government such as Mark Vaile and Peter McGauran still denying its existence, A Climate Resilient Australia will be seen for what it is: political posturing and window  dressing.

  "The Greens, on the other hand, have set out a thorough, science-based strategy to  tackle climate change, aiming to see Australia play a leadership role in constraining  global warming to 2C by reducing our emissions to 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 and  at least 80% by 2050. 

  "The IPCC has put climate change front and centre of the final week of this campaign.  Australian voters must be given the opportunity to examine the policy detail provided by  all parties - not just Labor and the Coalition - before they cast their votes on Saturday."
