 Independent Immigration Inquiry Needed  To Put Children First    

 The Minister’s decision to return a young orphan boy to Christmas Island,  just 48  hours after the funeral of his parents, is further evidence of the failure of the current  immigration regime to protect children, the Australian Greens said.  

 “It is unthinkable that a child should be returned to the place where he lost both his  parents, in such tragic circumstances.  He has family members in Sydney and  should be allowed to be with them - in the community,” said the Greens Immigration  Spokesperson, Senator Hanson-Young.  

 “This is an innocent child, who has lost his parents. His treatment is one of a number  of cases, whereby children’s welfare is secondary to the Government’s failed  immigration policies. We need an independent inquiry to examine how we can  safeguard the rights of children in our immigration system.”  

 "As signatories to both the Refugee Convention and the Convention on the Rights of  the Child, Australia has a responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the child  are paramount. This is particularly true when dealing with asylum seekers. Sadly  politics is getting in the way of doing what is best for these vulnerable children. The  welfare of children should be front and centre of public policy in this country - it  should never be sidelined in the name of politics or bureaucracy," Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 The Senator also responded to reports that Shadow Minister Schott Morrison urged  the Shadow Cabinet to exploit Islamaphobia within some segments of the  community. 

 “These reports are disturbing and the Leader of the Opposition must clarify whether  this is in fact the Liberal party’s position. It’s appalling to think that a public figure  would be trying to whip up community hysteria and racism in this way. It seems  some people within the Coalition are running a campaign to create unrest, to fan fear  and racist sentiments. This is a deplorable thing for any community leader to do.”  

 “ Rather than trying to focus on the things that divide us as a people, all leaders  should be focusing on the things that unite us. We should be celebrating this 

 wonderfully diverse country of ours - not trying to rip it apart,” Senator Hanson-Young said.
