 Not Nauru, not Malaysia but community detention: Greens 

 The Australian Greens say the Federal Opposition’s claim a detention centre on Nauru will be  cheaper than the Malaysian announcement misses the point that neither option is humane  because both seek to export Australia’s humanity toward asylum seekers. 

 “More than a dozen refugee and human rights groups last week backed the Greens’ stance  that neither Malaysia nor Nauru are acceptable locations to assess the claims of asylum  seekers,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “The upcoming parliamentary inquiry into mandatory detention, negotiated by the Greens,  will seek to have on the public record the costs of maintaining the off-shore detention system  compared to alternatives such as community detention. Once the facts are on the table,  Australians will be able to see the most cost-efficient use of their money. 

 “The UNHCR in Australia says there is no evidence mandatory detention deters people from  seeking asylum. 

 “Fairfax papers have today exposed the plight of poor and uneducated Indonesian boys  locked up in Australian prisons because they were duped by people smugglers.  These reports  are very concerning, but unfortunately not unique. The Australian Government has been  making a habit of over-looking the special minors status of Indonesian boys and imprisoning  them in adult facilities. It is a practice that must end, as it violates our obligations to children  and minors.   

 “The Australian government needs to ensure that we act in accordance with our international  obligations and treat all minors, regardless of where they come from, appropriately and with  care within our criminal justice system.  

 “Both sides of politics should pull back in their race to the bottom on asylum seeker policy  and instead work for alternatives that do not export Australia’s international obligations under  the treaties for refugees and torture.”
