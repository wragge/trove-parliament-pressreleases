 REFUGEE AND HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMME CUTS C O N F I R M   AN ACT OF MORAL BANKRUPTCY

 Mr Ruddock’s announcement of the Government's 1996-97  Humanitarian Program confirms every morally bankrupt detail of a  Cabinet submission leaked in mid May in which the Minister proposed  breaching the Coalition’s pre-election pledge ‘not to reduce the 

 refugee component and to emphasise the role of assisting genuine  refugees’.

 It confirms that the Howard Government is all about cuts, broken  promises and secret plans no matter what the consequences, no  matter who the victims.

 During the election campaign, Mr Howard claimed a virtual monopoly  on integrity and honesty -  but now the facade has been chipped away  to reveal the real John Howard.

 The refugee cuts break an election promise.

 In his Cabinet submission. Minister Ruddock said “my proposal to  reduce the size of the Humanitarian Program with the consequent  reduction in the Refugee program will bring into question our election  commitment ‘not to reduce the refugee component and to emphasise  the role of assisting genuine refugees’.

 Mr Ruddock has resorted to the presentational deceit he  foreshadowed in his leaked submission, to disguise the savagery of  the cuts he has made.

 From a base line program of 13,000 with 4000 refugee places, Mr  Ruddock will oversee a reduction to 10,000 places on an ongoing  basis —  a cut not just in 1996-97 but for every year into the future.

 A copy of the Cabinet Submission is attached so that the massive  cynicism and continuing deceit that this decision represents can be  properly understood.

 BACKGROUND

 The Humanitarian Program has two aims:

 (a) to assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with the 

 resettlement o f refugees; and

 (b) to provide a mechanism for people in Australia to have relations overseas m ' 

 situations o f discrimination and hardship join them in Australia.

 7 The Program provides resettlement for persons who satisfy the criteria under one of 

 the three elements:

 (a) . Refugee: for those who meet the United Nations definition of a refugee and have

 been identified in conjunction with UNHCR as in need of resettlemenr

 (b) Special H um anitarian Program : for those who have suffered discrimination 

 amounting to gross violation of human rights and who have strong support from 

 family or community groups in Australia; and

 (c) Special Assistance Category: for those who«, while not meeting the refugee or 

 Special Humanitarian criteria, are nonetheless ;n situations of discrimination, 

 displacement or hardship, and who have close family ties with Australia.

 3. The previous Government set the 1995-96 Humanitarian Program at 13,000 places. 

 Following an international appeal by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 

 (UNHCR) for additional resettlement places for the former Yugoslavia, the program was 

 increased to 15.0C0 in 1995-96 by bringing forward 2.00C places from 1996-97. The 

 bring-forward consisted of 665 Refugee, 667 Special Humanitarian and 668 Special 

 Assistance Category places. On i5 April 1996 the Expenditure Review Committee 

 (ERC JH 96/OOiO>agreed to the continuation of this post Budget measure but without any 

 bang forward of funding. Visas will be granted in 1995 96 for the 2,000 places brought 

 forward but arrivals will be managed to ensure that the expenditure is incurred in 1996-97.

 Îâ¢/! V. iLvdi Nt—  l

 4. The. Government's election commitments in reiatior. 10 the Human, tarmn Program 

 were to:

 (a) continue a separata Humanitarian Program;

 (b) not to reduce the refugee component and to emphasise the role ot" assisting genuine 

 refugees; and

 (c) review the efficiency and equity of the special assistance caiegoties. ·

 ISSUE

 5. I propose, as a savings measure, the Humanitarian Program be reduced to 10.000 

 places :n 1996-97 and subsequent years.

 6. The reduction to 10.000 places would be achieved in 1996-97 by reducing the 

 Special Assistance Category by 1.000 places and in 1997 98 and subsequent years by 

 reducing the Special Assistance Category by 3.000 places. The reduction to the Special 

 Assistance Category will have the least impact on-the Government’s core humanitnrinn 

 objectives and is in line with the rationale behind the review of this element or the 

 Program. The proposed reduced Program would consist ot the following:

 94-95 95-96 96-97 97-98

 Refugee . 4,000 -4,665 3.335 4,000

 Special Humanitarian Program 2,800 3.467 2.133 2.800

 Special Assistar.ee category 6,200 6,568 4,532 3,200

 t o t a l  â  13.000 15.000 10,000 10,000

 7. I am proposing (in rr.y Portfolio Budget Submission) to significantly reduce the 

 level o f funding available through the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme to Protection Vise 

 applicants in Ausvalia This measure, which will deny assistance under the scheme to 

 rejected applicants who seek review, will draw heavy criticism not only from ethnic 

 cnmnurvties our also welfare providers, the Church etc. My proposal to reduce the size of 

 the Humanitarian Program, with the consequent reduction in the Refugee component, will

 bring into question our election commitment 'not to reduce the refugee component and to 

 emphasise the role o f assisting genuine refugees.'

 S. There arc two options which would enable us to achieve the objectives o f reducing 

 the size of the Humanitarian Program whilst maintaining our commitment not to reduce the 

 Refugee component. These are:

 (a) Option 1. Restore the Refugee component to 4,000 places in 1996-97. This would 

 achieve an overall savings of $1.2 million to the Budget in 1996-97 but this is reduced 

 from the 52.7 million in AmichxncaLA. [Precise figure to be con firmed]. The full level of 

 savings will be realised in subsequent years.

 (b) Option 2; Retain 3,335 Refugee places in 1996-97 (as outlined in paragraph 6) and 

 rationalise, for public presentation, the allocations for [995-96 and 1996-97. That is, taken 

 over the two vear period, the Refugee allocation has remained constant thus meeting our 

 commitment.

 9, I have carefully considered these options particularly in regard to my related 

 initiative to reduce the level of the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme, our election 

 commitments and rhe likely adverse public reactions to my savings initiatives. My 

 preference, for strong presentational reasons and to aver, the criticisms outlined above, 

 would he to propose Option 1. However, in view of the difficult budget situation we are 

 in. I am reluctantly proposing that Option 2 be adopted. In proposing this option I am *  *

 conscious that we will have difficulty sustaining the argument that we have kept our 

 commitment not to' reduce the Refugee component, notwithstanding the fact that, taken

 over the two year period, it has remained constant.

 Qnmmur.iry Rssxcrion

 10. There is strong community support for particular Special Assistance Categories and 

 the Humanitarian Program in general. The Government nay expect vocal criticism from 

 community groups on the bases that the proposed program signals a reduction in rhe

 Government’s commitment towards humanitarian resettlement and that s o m e  deserv:

 resettlement applicants will be denied a program placi­

 ng

 A r.cra.iT jriag for Prrueaionddsas..Gc3nted^ Ï .Austral m

 1L. The previous Government decided that chose persons granted permanent residence as a 

 result of a successful application for refugee status m Australia would not be counted against 

 the Humanitarian (or the Migration) Program. In 1994-95 some 1.597 persons were granted 

 refugee status in Australia and for the first nine months of this year, some 1,4-78 applicants 

 have been successful.

 12. Presen unionally, wc would gain benefits by adding to the Humanitarian Program the

 estimated number of grants o f Protection Visas In 1996-97. That is. we coulc announce that 

 our com m itm ent to refugees and humanitarian resettlement has been set at 12.000 places in 

 1996-97. consisting o f 10.000 places offshore uno 2.000 places onshore. There -would be no 

 ^  financial implications tor the Budget from this proposal. -

 13 As part of this initiative. I would propose taut if the Protection Visa grants onshore 

 were to exceed 2.000 places in [996-?7. then resettlement of persons from offshore would be 

 reduced accordingly. Were there to be any unexpected increase in the numbers of persons 

 ^  granted Protection Visas onshore this proposal would limit the implications for the Budget.

 P· npnrifl! lm r^rt^ns

 is. Air-arSn-a-M a details the savings arising from the proposal. Whilst the savings for 

 this P o r/o lio  are r.gt significant (rising to S ’ .93 L  million in year 3 and onwards) they are 

 much greater m other portfolios (such as Soda: Security, Employment. Education. 

 Training arc Youth Affairs, and Health and Family Services). The savings assume that the 

 nrnv-al of these entrants will be spread evenly throughout the year (Ir. line with visa issue). 

 They also assume that Special A s s is ta n c e  Category e n tra n ts will continue to us

 services after their first year in Australia.
