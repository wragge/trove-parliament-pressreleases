 MEDIA RELEASE

  

  

 PEOPLE TRAFFICKERS INTERCEPTED The Royal Australian Navy has intercepted, and prevented reaching Australia’s migration zone, a people trafficking boat.

 Late on Friday September 7 a Coastwatch aircraft located the vessel enroute to Ashmore Islands.

 The ANZAC frigate HMAS WARRAMUNGA was dispatched to intercept the vessel.

 Warnings to turn the vessel around were delivered from HMAS WARRAMUNGA’s boat.

 The vessel was displaying no flags or port of registry indications and was therefore boarded under the law of the sea as a ‘stateless vessel’ to allow HMAS WARRAMUNGA to establish the port of registry from the vessel’s books.

 This occurred approximately thirty-five nautical miles north of Ashmore Islands in international waters.

 The vessel was identified as the ACENG, registered in Bali.

 Further warnings were delivered to the crew to turn the vessel around however the vessel continued toward Ashmore Islands.

 When the vessel entered the contiguous zone (24 nautical miles from Ashmore Islands shore) a further boarding was conducted and the vessel was made to depart the contiguous zone.

 Over the next six hours boardings were undertaken and the ACENG was compelled to move to the edge of the contiguous zone on each occasion.

 The crew and passengers of the ACENG became agitated and the Commander of HMAS WARRAMUNGA decided further boardings should not be undertaken.

 HMAS WARRAMUNGA and HMAS NEWCASTLE delivered food and medical supplies to the ACENG but did not try to remove it from Australia’s contiguous zone.

 HMAS MANOORA joined the ships at sunrise and the 227 people on ACENG were transferred voluntarily to HMAS MANOORA.

 This occurred at the limit of Australia’s territorial waters (12 nautical miles from shore).

 HMAS MANOORA is now proceeding to a location off Darwin, outside Australia’s territorial waters, for scheduled reprovisioning.

 Asylum seekers can only make a valid application for a protection visa from within the migration zone which, broadly speaking, commences at the low water mark.
