 1987-88 MIGRATION PROGRAM OUTCOME REFLECTS GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON  ECONOMIC MIGRATION

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs,  Mr Clyde Holding, said today the migration program  outcome for 1987-88 had given the lie to claims that recent  Government policies were sending the program in the wrong  direction.

 In particular, he said, it disproved allegations that:

 - the migration program was 1  out of control';

 - the level of skilled migration was declining; and

 - Asian-born migrants were mostly unskilled and contributed  nothing to Australia's economic future.

 "The provisional outcome for the 1987-88 migration program of  134 669 new settlers was just two per cent over the program  target of 132 000," Mr Holding said.

 "This minor overshoot was largely the result of the larger-than-  expected number of Grant of Resident Status approvals,  which are  essentially demand-driven.

 "The Government has been sharpening the economic focus of the  migration program for the past four years,  yet our critics have  consistently refused to acknowledge this.

 "Let me draw attention to the following facts:

 - in 1987-88, 7387 business migrants and their families were  issued visas compared to 3580 in 1986-87;

 - in 1987-88, 16 010 people were issued visas as independent migrants, selected on the basis of their skills, employability  and education, compared with just 4687 in 1986-87;

 - in 1987-88, 19.3 per cent of settlers had professional,  technical or skilled trade occupations, compared with 13.7 per  cent four years ago;

 - consistent with an emphasis on skills, employability and  education, the average age of migrants has risen, from 25.9  years in 1983-84 to 26.7 years in 1987-88 —  but this is hardly  a dramatic increase; the average compares to the average in  Australia of 36.4 years;

 - Asian-born migrants comprised 32 per cent of the skilled labour  intake in 1987-88 (compared to 24 per cent the previous year)   while more than three quarters of business migrants in the past  two years' have come from Asia (78 per cent in 1986-87 and 79  per cent in 1987-88)."

 Mr Holding said the rise in the skill level of migrants had been  a direct result of deliberate policy changes,  and in particular  an adjustment of the points test. .

 The pass mark was raised in June 1988 to 80 points or, in the  case of those scoring the maximum on the employability factor, to  75 points.

 "This policy change is sharpening the focus on skills, just as  other policy changes have led to a major surge in the Business  Migration Program (BMP), with all the benefits that is bringing  to Australia," Mr Holding said.

 "Might I remind our critics that since the BMP began in 1982-83,  3700 business migrants,  together with their families, have come  to Australia, creating some 30 000 jobs and generating hundreds  of millions of dollars in export earnings.

 "The substantial jump in business migration in 1987-88 directly  reflects the Government's initiative to accredit private  enterprise agents to streamline the processing of applications  from prospective migrants," the Minister said.

 On the question of Asian migration, Mr Holding said the trend in  recent years to a point where approximately one third of new  settlers came from the Asian region was simply a reflection of  Australia's changing economic circumstances and an inevitable  outcome of our closer links with the region.

 "The economic reality is that Australia's prosperity depends  fairly and squarely on growing trade relations with Asia," he  said.

 "Let me make it very clear that an increased emphasis on the  migration of skilled people who can make an immediate 

 contribution to Australia is likely to lead to an increase in  settlers from Asia. Our critics tend to forget that many Asians  are highly educated, are skilled, are extremely employable and  have a first-class command of English.

 "At the same time,  the Government's emphasis on skills,  as  demonstrated by the more stringent points test,  may mean fewer  clerks and semi-skilled migrants but more highly skilled and  business migrants.

 "But in the midst of all this debate, might I remind everyone  that the Government has no intention of turning its back on  social and humanitarian migration.

 "The family reunion and refugee categories will continue as an  important component of our overall program," Mr Holding said.
