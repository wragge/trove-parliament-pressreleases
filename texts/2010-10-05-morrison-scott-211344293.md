 Business as usual for people smugglers under Gillard  05/10/10  

 The illegal arrival of the second boat in as many days shows that business has returned to  normal for people smugglers under Julia Gillard and Labor, Shadow Minister for Productivity  & Population and Shadow Minister for Immigration & Citizenship, Scott Morrison and  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs & Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.   

 The latest boat carrying 41 people is the 99th to arrive this year, bringing a total of 4912  people.   

 “Julia Gillard is now just one boat short of our first ever âtonâ of boats in a calendar year. The  highest number of illegal boat arrivals previously was 86, which Labor passed on Election  Day this year,” Mr Morrison said.   

 “Labor cannot expect different results if they are not prepared to change their failed policies,”  he said.   

 “100 days ago Julia Gillard said Labor had lost their way and identified illegal boat arrivals  as a key reason why Labor dumped Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister. 100 days later and the  boats continue to arrive just as they did under Kevin Rudd.   

 “Kevin Ruddâs failed border protection policies have become Julia Gillardâs failed policies  and the boats continue to arrive.   

 “The consequence of these failures is a detention network in crisis and a budget out of  control.   

 “Laborâs East Timor proposal is a never never plan. Instead Labor is expanding the on shore  detention network by 1,000 beds and when asked in Parliament this week refused to nominate  the cost to the taxpayer for the expansion or explain their denial of these plans before the  election.   

 “Labor has no answers to the crisis they have created in the detention network and no  answers to stop the unprecedented arrival of illegal boats since they softened Australia's  border protection and immigration regime that now stands at 167 and 7,947 people.”   

 Michael Keenan said: “Another two boats have arrived in two days, and yet due to the  frequency of arrivals we have come to expect under Labor, we are no longer surprised.   

 How have we come to accept this new average of three boats arriving each week, this border  security disaster, when under the Coalition we had an average of only 3 boats arriving each  year?   

 This Labor Government has shown no respect to the Australian people, instead expecting  them to turn a blind eye while they tear down whatâs left of our borders.
