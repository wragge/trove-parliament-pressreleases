 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 CALLING COALITION MODERATES: THE KIDS NEED YOU

 It is time for moderate Coalition MPs to show compassion and help Labor to get the children out from behind the razor wire of high security immigration detention.  Next week the House of Representatives will debate the Migration Legislation Amendment (No.1) Bill.  Labor will seek to amend this Bill and modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that children cannot be held in high security detention for long periods of time.

 Labor’s amendment would compel the Government to:

 â¢ Put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements. â¢ Allow families with children to live in accommodation like the Woomera alternate detention trial.

 Currently, under this trial, female asylum seekers with children live in ordinary style housing with supervision and security.  This model could be extended to deal with whole family groups.

 There is no credible argument against this proposal.  No-one can reasonably suggest that unaccompanied children are better off in high security compounds behind razor wire.  For accompanied children, the Woomera alternate detention trial provides a clear model for the future.

 The Minister’s own Immigration Detention Advisory Group has recommended it be used for family groups and the Minister himself has indicated that he is considering expanding this trial.

 The only thing that would prevent Government members voting for Labor’s amendment is political belligerence.  The welfare of kids is too important to let political face-saving stand in the way of a meritorious proposal.

 More than six months ago, Simon Crean first appealed to Coalition MPs to join ordinary Australians in supporting the release of children from immigration detention centres.  Since then, the chorus of voices from across the community in support of Labor’s plan has grown and is now impossible to ignore.  Whatever view one holds about the appropriate way of dealing with asylum seekers, children are the innocent ones in a situation not of their making and beyond their control.

 I am now appealing to Coalition MPs to put the needs of children in detention first.  Many have witnessed riots, suicides, hunger strikes and other forms of self harm.  No child should grow up in these circumstances.

 Next week, Coalition MPs can act to save children from further suffering by voting for Labor’s amendment.  The Australian community will be watching the choice each Coalition MP makes.
