 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Defence 

 13 March 2003 MEDIA ALERT     03/ 144             

 

 PM’s war speech about defence of US militarism not  Australian security  ‘Ridiculous’ claim that a resolution authorising force can bring peace  Hypocrisy of pointing to human rights abuses in Iraq while sending Iraqi refugees back.   

 The Prime Minister’s address on Iraq was full of hypocrisy, sloppy logic and simpering praise for  American militarism, Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, said today.   

 It is the height of hypocrisy that the PM argued that the “Iraqi people are oppressed by this regime” and  gave examples of torture in Iraq, yet the Howard Government has consistently tried to send Iraqi  asylum seekers back, has sent the Navy to turn refugee boats away, and has run a long campaign of  vilification against them including false claims they threw their children overboard.   

 “How can he claim to care about the suffering of the people of Iraq, when thousands have been locked  up in detention in Australia and he continues to try and return them to Iraq?   

 “It is ridiculous for the PM to claim that if the Security Council authorises war, peace can happen.  For the PM to propose that another resolution authorising force could bring about peace through a  change in attitude from Iraq, ignores the stated intentions of the US. The PM may want a ‘change in  attitude’ from Iraq, but the US will not settle for anything less than regime change.    

 “The Prime Minister continues to attempt to link unrelated  issues such as Bali and September 11 to a  war on Iraq, with no evidence any such link exists.   

 “The PM claims the disarmament of Iraq will substantially decrease the chance of terrorists acquiring  weapons of mass destruction. Yet experts have said the most likely chance of terrorists acquiring  WMD’s is during in the turmoil and instability of war and the period after.    

 “No one wants WMD being acquired by terrorists but Iraq is hardly the only source. America still has  chemical weapons and on the most optimistic timetable, will not destroy them for several years.   

 “We can’t go to war against every country that has WMD. As a middle power Australia should be  supporting multilateral frameworks that build confidence and information sharing between countries.  Instead the Prime Minister has hitched our national security to American might and an unswerving  belief in American right.    

 “The PM said Australian foreign policy should reflect Australian values but Australia’s defence and  foreign policy is now effectively determined by the United States. US President George Bush will  decide when Australia goes to war.   

 Senator Bartlett called on the Prime Minister John Howard to release legal advice that backs his claims  that war on Iraq would be legal without another UN resolution authorising force.
