 Organised Crime and Terrorism in the Asia-Pacific Region:  The Reality and the Response   

 

 

 Abstract 

 

 Organised and entrepreneurial crime groups are well established throughout the Asia-Pacific region,  and have been very active in the whole spectrum of criminal activities from drug trafficking, human  and arms smuggling, sea piracy and kidnapping to credit card fraud, investment scams, money  laundering and intellectual property crime.  These groups range from the highly structured Japanese  yakuza and Chinese triads to small entrepreneurial groups specialising in providing a particular  criminal service and street gangs engaging in opportunistic crime.  There are also states, such as the  DPRK and Myanmar, where senior officials periodically engage in criminal activities, such as drug  trafficking and counterfeit currency operations, with the apparent knowledge of, and blessing from, the  state itself.   

 With little or no state sponsorship, terrorist groups operating in the region have little option but to  engage in criminal activities in order to generate the necessary funds to support their political  objectives.  Such activities range from drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping, and bank robberies to  credit card fraud and manipulation of the stock markets.  Many groups also engage in legitimate  business activities.  Some groups, such as the Philippine Abu Sayyaf, could be more accurately  described as criminal rather than terrorist groups, even though they employ terrorist methods. 

 A range of international and regional initiatives has been devised to limit the effectiveness of  transnational criminal and terrorist groups which, if implemented on a region-wide basis, would  certainly have a very significant impact in lowering the level of threat they currently present. 

 

 

 

 Background 

 Much has been written over the last decade on the emerging problem of transnational 

 organised crime, which has become identified as one of the key new issues 

 challenging international stability and security.  The United Nations Secretary 

 General, Kofi Annan, summed up the situation in the following words: 

 The  benefits  of  globalisation  are  obvious:  faster  growth,  higher  living   standards,  new  opportunities.  Yet  a  backlash  has  begun,  because  these   benefits  are  so  unequally  distributed,  and  because  the  global  market  is   not yet underpinned by rules based on shared social objectives.... In this  New World, groups and individuals more and more often interact directly  across frontiers, without involving the State. This has its dangers. Crime,  narcotics, terrorism, pollution, disease, weapons, refugees and migrants:  all move back and forth faster and in greater numbers than in the past.1 

 The events of September 11 have dramatically demonstrated that highly-motivated 

 and capable non-state actors, employing carefully planned and targeted terrorist 

  2

 operations, facilitated by criminal activities involving drug trafficking, financial crime 

 and covert money movements, identification fraud, and so on, have been able to 

 seriously challenge the global strategic order and precipitate a major rethink of 

 national and international defence, security and law enforcement priorities.  Those 

 who predicted that September 11 would be just a nasty blip on the global security 

 radar screen have been proven wrong: the “War Against Terrorism” has 

 fundamentally changed United States strategic priorities causing it to adopt a hard-line unilateralist approach (albeit couched in “coalition” terminology) which will 

 have a major impact on the global security outlook and, inevitably, risks upsetting the 

 security relationships with other states.  This is the era of the post-post-Cold War. 

 Although not so obvious, transnational crime also possesses the potential to severely 

 destabilise states through the illicit trafficking in arms, people and drugs; or attacking 

 critical databases and systems through cyber-crime; impacting on the economies of 

 states through fraud, white collar crime, money laundering or capital flight; or 

 upsetting public confidence in governance through endemic graft and corruption. 

 This paper will consider the nature and capacity of transnational organised crime in 

 the Asia-Pacific; its links to terrorism in the region; and the regional and international 

 measures which are being developed to deal with these threats. 

 Transnational Organised Crime in the Asia-Pacific 

 Factors facilitating the growth of transnational organised crime in the region 

 The global developments that have encouraged economic growth and diversification 

 in recent years have also facilitated the development of transnational organised 

 crime.2  These developments include: 

 â¢ The dramatic advances in and decreased costs of international travel and the  transportation of goods; the removal of external travel restrictions in many  countries that previously controlled overseas travel for their citizens; and the  removal of visa requirements for entry into many countries. 

 

 1   “We the Peoples”: Millennium Report to the General Assembly of the United Nations, 3 April  2000.  2

   AndrÃ© Bossard, former Secretary-General of the International Criminal Police Organization  (Interpol), defines transnational crime as “an offence which implies crossing at least one border before,  during, or after the fact.”  [AndrÃ© Bossard, Transnational Crime and Criminal Law, Chicago:  University of Illinois and Office of International Criminal Justice, 1990, p. 3.]

 â¢ The changing nature of state sovereignty due to the emergence of regional  associations and trading blocs. Related to this is deregulation, the  internationalization of business corporations, and networking across national  boundaries. 

 â¢ The dramatic developments in technology and communications, including the so-called “CNN factor” and the emergence of the Internet. 

 â¢ The social, economic, and political changes that have occurred with globalization  and the adoption of the market economy and western democratic values, which  have led to increased levels of unemployment and untenable systems of state  welfare and public health services in both developed and developing countries.  This, in some cases, leads to crime becoming a means of survival for  disadvantaged people. 

 â¢ The uneven development between “Northern” and “Southern” states (especially  African and South Pacific states). 

 â¢ Increasing levels of education and rising expectations of people in many  developing countries, possibly leading to mass population movements internally  and illegal immigration externally in search of a better life. 

 â¢ The increasing sophistication of criminal organizations, which are becoming  significant players in international economic activity. 

 â¢ The potential for transnational organised crime groups (particularly from the  former Soviet Union) to acquire and sell chemical, biological, radiological or  nuclear agents or technology to criminal or terrorist groups, or to so-called “rogue  states”; 

 â¢ The apparent increase of corruption, which facilitates crime at both the national  and international levels. 

 â¢ The inability of most countries to allocate increasing resources to the criminal  justice system and law enforcement. 

 â¢ The  difficulty  that  the  law  enforcement  agencies  of  many  countries  have  in   developing  and  maintaining  the  technical  skills  required  to  keep  pace  with   banking and financial methodologies, developments in computers, technology and  communications, and the increasing complexity of national and international law.3 

 Definition of organised crime 

 With the signing by 154 nations of the United Nations Convention Against 

 Transnational Organised Crime (2000) in Palermo, Italy,4 in December 2000, for the

Pattugalan (Eds.):  Transnational Crime and Regional Security in the Asia Pacific, Manila:  Institute for Strategic and Development Studies and Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia  Pacific, 1999, pp. 24-25.  For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see John McFarlane:   “Transnational Crime and Asia-Pacific Security: Beyond 2000” in Sheldon Simon (Ed.):  The Many  Faces of Security. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc., forthcoming (2001).  4

   It was highly symbolic that the meeting was held in Palermo, long the centre of power of the  Sicilian mafia, the most feared and successful of the Italian criminal organisations, and the site of the 

  4

 first time there is an internationally accepted definition of organized crime.5 6 The 

 Convention states, at Article 2(a), that - 

 [An] organised criminal group shall mean a structured group7 of three or  more persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the  aim of committing one or more serious crimes8 or offences established in  accordance  with  this  Convention,  in  order  to  obtain,  directly  or   indirectly, a financial or other material benefit. 

 Many other authorities and writers have also attempted to describe the attributes of 

 organised crime. For example, Howard Abadinsky defines the concept in a more 

 conventional way as: 

 ...  a  non-ideological  enterprise  involving  a  number  of  persons  in  close   social  interaction,  organized  on  a  hierarchical  basis  with  at  least  three   levels/ranks,  for  the  purpose  of  securing  profit  and  power  by  engaging  in   illegal  and  legal  activities.  Positions  in  the  hierarchy  and  positions   involving functional specialization may be assigned on the basis of kinship  or friendship, or rationally assigned according to skill. The positions are not  dependent  on  the  individuals  occupying  them  at  any  particular  time.   Permanency is assumed by the members who strive to keep the enterprise  integral and active in pursuit of its goals. It eschews competition and strives  for  monopoly  on  an  industry  or  territorial  basis.  There  is  a  willingness  to   use  violence  and/or  bribery  to  achieve  ends  and  maintain  discipline.   Membership  is  restricted,  although  non-members  may  be  involved  on  a   contingency  basis.  There  are  explicit  rules,  oral  or  written,  which  are   enforced by sanctions that include murder.9 

 However it is defined, organized crime is intent on using its power to make money, 

 and it will do so, legally and illegally, trading in whatever commodity will provide 

 maximum profit for the lowest possible risk of detection and prosecution. At both the 

 national and international levels, organized crime is likely to be involved in varied 

 and nefarious activities. Among these activities are trafficking of arms and narcotics, 

 crimes of violence, racketeering, money laundering, pornography and prostitution, 

 computer and ecological crimes, and many others. As organized crime infiltrates these 

 

 murders, in 1992, of two courageous anti-mafia judges, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and  the subsequent arrest of the Sicilian mafia “boss of bosses”, Toto Riina.  5   The Convention will have the status of international law when it is ratified by 40 governments.  6

   See “Organised Crime in 2000” in Jane’s Foreign Report, No. 2623, 11 January 2001, pp. 1-2.  7   The Convention describes a “structured group” at Article 2(c) as “a group that is not randomly  formed for the immediate commission of an offence and that does not need to have formally defined  roles for its members, continuity of its membership or a developed structure.”  8

  The Convention describes a “serious crime” at Article 2 (b) as “ … conduct constituting an  offence punishable by a maximum deprivation of liberty of at least four years or more serious penalty.”

 various sectors of the economy, its activities are often supported by accountants, 

 lawyers, financial advisers, bankers and chemists, as well as corrupt or compliant 

 politicians, judges, local government officials, law enforcement officers, members of 

 the military, media executives, professional people, businessmen,10 and even 

 community activists and priests. The underlying motive for this criminality, in most 

 cases, is quite simply power and money.11 

 The signing of the Convention was the culmination of six years of intensive effort by 

 the Vienna-based Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP).12  This 

 process began with the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan Against 

 Organised Transnational Crime, which the United Nations General Assembly 

 adopted in 1994, to deal with the increasingly insidious threat of transnational crime.  

 Accompanying the Convention are three important Protocols: the Protocol to Prevent, 

 Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, the 

 Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, and the Protocol 

 Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and 

 Components and Ammunition.  The ODCCP is now working on a draft treaty or 

 protocol on corruption and some additional work on cyber-crime.13 

 Transnational Organised Crime in the Asia-Pacific 

 In the interests of brevity, and to maintain the focus on the Asia-Pacific region, this 

 paper will consider the impact of transnational and organised crime on the security and 

 stability of five countries in the region - China (including, for the purpose of this

Many leading criminal entrepreneurs have come from a legitimate business  background.  11

 discussion Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan14), Japan, the Republic of Korea (South 

 Korea), the Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Russian Far East.15 

 It is evident from the details contained in the Annex “A” that, although the nature of 

 the transnational organised crime threat differs with each of the countries concerned, 

 the threat posed by these groups presents a significant problem for the countries of the 

 Asia-Pacific.  Not only has organised crime presented a serious internal challenge for 

 the governments of the region, but it is also inextricably  linked to corruption which is 

 a serious issue in most Asia-Pacific countries (including Australia), and which 

 undermines the conduct of good governance and frequently leads to community 

 reactions involving public order issues. 

 In the case of the DPRK, the evidence available suggests that the regime has, at the 

 least in the past, turned a blind eye to criminal activities, such as drug production and 

 trafficking, and the counterfeiting of and trafficking in foreign currency, involving 

 DPRK officials and diplomats abroad.   

 Impact of Transnational Organised Crime 

 National and transnational organised crime can have very significant impacts at the 

 political, military, economic, societal, environmental, and, of course, human security 

 levels. These impacts clearly extend to national and international security concerns 

 and to questions of stability and predictability in international relations. 

 Simply put, Phil Williams states that “insidious, pervasive and multifaceted” 

 transnational crime threatens: 

 â¢ sovereignty; 

 â¢ societies; 

 â¢ individuals; 

 â¢ national stability and state control; 

 â¢ democratic values and public institutions; 

 â¢ national economies; 

 â¢ financial institutions; 

 

 14   The inclusion of Taiwan in this context has nothing to do with the question of sovereignty; it  is due to the common ethnicity of the Chinese organised criminal groups involved.  15

   Consideration could also have been given to organised crime groups in Thailand, Malaysia,  Indonesia, the Philippines or Vietnam, but in these cases the groups concerned are apparently more  diverse and entrepreneurial and less well structured than those described in Annex “A”.   

  7

 â¢ democratization and privatization; 

 â¢ development; 

 â¢ global regimes and codes of conduct.16 

 Many of the crime trends now evident are not new to Asia, but the frequency and 

 sophistication of these trends are increasing. In addition, almost all the significant 

 crime problems of the Asia Pacific and other regions are transnational rather than 

 domestic in scope. What is also new to the region is the way in which the increasing 

 crime trends are intersecting with other social and economic problems to destabilize 

 individual nations, and therefore, the entire region. Furthermore, transnational 

 organized crime groups in the Asia Pacific are proving to be more resilient, 

 sophisticated, and international in both their activities and outlook. They have been 

 able to take advantage of weak governments, corruption, and nepotism, cultural and 

 ethnic links spreading far beyond individual countries, the growth of materialism, the 

 proximity of cheap supplies of drugs (both natural and synthetic), the desire of many of 

 the people of the region to settle elsewhere in pursuit of economic or personal security, 

 and, above all, the increasing gulf between the rich and the poor, the successful and the 

 unemployable, the educated and the uneducated, and the well-fed and the hungry. 

 These are all serious dichotomies for the people of the Asia Pacific region, and many 

 of them are precursors to systemic and serious crime and long-term social instability. 

 Such has been the impact of transnational crime over the last decade that many 

 countries now regard transnational crime, in its various manifestations, as a national 

 security issue,17 so that the law enforcement efforts in this area are strongly supported 

 by national intelligence community taskings, and the “whole of government” approach 

 to national security also encompasses prioritizing and resource allocation to combat 

 transnational crime.  President Bill Clinton of the United States took the lead in this

 area in 1995 when he issued Presidential Decision Directive 42 (PDD-42),18 but other 

 major industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, 

 Canada and Russia have adopted a similar approach and tasked their Intelligence 

 Services and agencies accordingly.  Unfortunately, with the exception of a greater 

 emphasis on countering illegal immigration, the Australian Government has not yet 

 incorporated the wider threats from transnational crime or the higher level of offences 

 against Commonwealth law, into the national security agenda.   

 Strategies for Dealing with Transnational Organised Crime 

 New strategies need to be developed to deal with the threat of transnational organised 

 crime.  Such strategies might include:19 

 â¢ Encourage the development of compatible laws between nations to facilitate 

 the exchange of intelligence, the application of mutual assistance 

 arrangements, simplify extradition arrangements between states, enhance 

 investigations into and recovery of the proceeds of crime, and generally speed 

 the process of handling transnational criminal matters. 

 â¢ Encourage states to accede to the major United Nations and other international  Conventions, such as the three United Nations Drug Conventions (1961, 1971  and 1988),20 supporting the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action  Plan Against Organised Transnational Crime,21 support the implementation of  the eleven point plan to combat transnational crime, agreed at the 1st ASEAN 

 

 18   Signed by President Clinton on October 21, 1995, PDD-42 specifically addresses the nation's  fight against international crime. PDD-42 recognizes that such criminal activity threatens U.S. national  security and directs the federal agencies to combat international crime from the criminal barons  sheltered overseas to the violence and destruction they deliver to our streets. PDD-42 also provides  continuity to earlier Administration policy, complements other presidential directives on alien  smuggling, drug trafficking, terrorism and nuclear materials, and mandates intensified federal efforts  against international criminals - http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/press/Xoptim.htm, accessed 17 June  2001.  19

 Conference on Transnational Crime in Manila, the Philippines, in 199822 and  the seven strategies agreed at G8 meeting in Birmingham, England, in May  1998,23 the adoption of the 40 Recommendations the G-7 Financial Action  Task Force (FATF),24 and enacting the OECD recommendations on  combating bribery of foreign public officials25, and, of course, ratifying the  new United Nations Convention Against Transnational Crime and its various  protocols.  â¢ Encourage bilateral and multilateral cooperation and information flow 

 between law enforcement agencies, including supporting the role of such  organisations as INTERPOL (International Criminal Police Organisation),  ASEANAPOL, EUROPOL and the Customs Cooperation Council. 

 â¢ Encourage a greater level of coordinated cross border and transnational  cooperation through regional coordination meetings and operational targeting,  multilateral police training programs and technical exchanges (including  employing compatible computer databases). 

 Transnational organized crime - and terrorism - can no longer be written off as 

 “boutique” regional security issues.  These problems have become central to security 

 and international policy concerns in the post-Cold War era, extending far beyond the 

 scope of conventional law enforcement.  The response to these transnational threats 

 has resulted in a blurring of the traditional demarcation between diplomatic, military, 

 law enforcement, and intelligence roles of nations. 

 Countering the threat of transnational organised crime calls for the development of 

 appropriate resources, professional skills, regulatory regimes, highly developed 

 criminal intelligence and analytical capabilities, a dynamic and modern criminal justice 

 system, and close cooperation between the law enforcement community and the 

 relevant professions. However, no state can defeat a criminal threat that is generated 

 from outside its jurisdiction without developing sound working relations and 

 cooperation with neighboring states and adopting international “best practices.” For 

 this reason the answer to the transnational crime threat requires new, imaginative and 

 constructive regional and international responses.

 Transnational Crime and Terrorism 

 Background 

 Traditionally, terrorist activities have been financed from a variety of sources: 

 â¢ State sponsorship, from, say, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria and, in the past, the former  Soviet bloc; 

 â¢ Non-state sponsorship, which is an increasing feature of modern terrorism and  appears to be a major characteristic of al-Qa’ida, which has provided funding,  training and infrastructure support to a network of groups sympathetic to own  aims, apparently on a scale much wider than previously estimated; 

 â¢ Drug production and trafficking (or narco-terrorism), which has been a major  source of income for al-Qa’ida, using its international links on a commission basis  (10-15%).  Many other terrorist groups also use drug production or trafficking as a  major source of income; 

 â¢ Other illicit activities, such as diamond sales.  Al-Qa’ida is assessed as having  reaped hundreds of millions of dollars over the last three years from the illicit  sales of diamonds mined by its allies, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in  Sierra Leone. 

 In 2001, the FATF identified the following major sources of terrorist funding: 

 â¢ Drug production and trafficking; 

 â¢ Extortion, i.e. extortion of businesses, building companies, social clubs, and  wealthy individuals;  

 â¢ Kidnapping for ransom, i.e. hostage taking to extort money or political concessions  (accompanied by the threat of execution); 

 â¢ Robberies, especially bank robberies; 

 â¢ Fraud, especially credit card fraud; 

 â¢ Illicit gambling operations; 

 â¢ Smuggling and trafficking in counterfeit goods; 

 â¢ Direct sponsorship by states; 

 â¢ Contributions and donations; 

 â¢ Sale of publications (legal and illegal); 

 â¢ Legitimate business activities.26 

 To this list could be added: 

 â¢ Illicit trafficking in firearms and diamonds; 

 â¢ Human smuggling and sex trafficking; 

 

 26   See Bill Tupman: “The Business of Terrorism”.  Presentation made to a Conference on  Terrorism and Finance at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London, 29 November  2001.

 â¢ Manipulation of the stock market. 

 It should be remembered that the funds generated from these criminal activities might 

 not flow directly into supporting terrorist operations, but may be invested in legitimate 

 sources to generate a long-term cash flow for the group concerned.  Frequently, these 

 means of generating money are so successful, that they may continue, as conventional 

 criminal activity, after the political campaign has been concluded.27 

 When he established al-Qa’ida in the early 1990s, Osama bin Laden provided it with 

 substantial “seed money” - assessed at about US$150 million - from his personal 

 wealth and the profits of his business enterprises.  In addition, al-Qa’ida has benefited 

 (and apparently continues to benefit) from donations from wealthy supporters from 

 Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and other Middle Eastern countries.  In addition, al-Qa’ida derives funds from a number of lucrative legitimate business enterprises 

 established by bin Laden and others in the Sudan, the Middle East, and elsewhere.  Al-Qa’ida also appears to have made significant profits on the stock market, particularly 

 

 27   According to Schmid, there are a number of similarities and differences in  relation to transnational crime and terrorism which need to be noted to better  understand these two phenomena:   

 â¢ Similarities: 

 o Members are generally (but not always) rational actors; 

 o Both use intimidation and ruthlessness; 

 o Both use similar tactics - drug trafficking, kidnappings, extortion, bank  robberies, assassinations, etc; 

 o Both operate in secrecy; 

 o Both are criminalised by the ruling regime; 

 o Both usually (but not always) opposed to the state; 

 o Both place heavy demands on individual members. 

 â¢ Differences: 

 o Terrorist groups are usually ideologically rather than profit motivated; 

 o Terrorists usually admit their guilt in courts; 

 o Terrorists seek media coverage for their cause; 

 o Terrorist victimisation is less discriminate than criminal victimisation; 

 o Terrorists compete with governments for legitimacy;  o Criminal groups are more competitive and territorial.

 through the exploitation of hedge funds, and the “short selling” of shares in insurance 

 and airline stocks just before 11 September 2001. 

 The investigation of the sources of funding for the people involved in the incidents on 

 11 September have been based on international intelligence exchanges; the 

 exploitation of documentation recovered from post-11 September investigations in the 

 United States and elsewhere, and documents and videotapes recovered in post-action 

 searches in Afghanistan; from the interrogation of well over 1,100 suspects in the 

 United States and elsewhere; and from substantial support from the international 

 banking sector, leading to the freezing of the funds of some 74 organisations and 

 individuals globally, said to be associated with al-Qa’ida and related terrorist 

 activities.  About 150 countries now have blocking orders in place to freeze terrorist 

 funds and 200 countries have expressed their support in the fight against terrorist 

 financing.  Already, the money frozen is said to exceed US$100 million.  Regardless 

 of the issue of terrorist funding, criminal money laundering on a global scale is a 

 massive problem.  Michel Candessus, the former Head of the International Monetary 

 Fund, has assessed the annual volume of money laundering world-wide at US$600 

 billion, or between 2-5% of global GDP. 

 International Response to Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 

 A number of major initiatives have been taken to counter money laundering and trace 

 the sources of terrorist finances.  These initiatives, and the organisational structures

 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)  [http://www.fatf-gafi/org] was established 

 by the G-728 in 1989, and is administered by the Organisation for Economic 

 Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Since its creation the FATF has spearheaded 

 the effort to adopt and implement measures designed to counter the use of the

 financial system by criminals.  It established a set of 40 Recommendations that set out 

 the basic framework for anti-money laundering efforts and are intended to be of 

 universal application.  Indeed, the 40 Recommendations are now the principal 

 standard in this field.  The FATF reviews its members for compliance with the 40 

 Recommendations.  There are currently 31 members in the FATF29, including an 

 Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)30 which has  an office in Sydney, 

 and which covers the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. 

 To reduce the vulnerability of the international financial system to misuse by 

 criminals, the FATF is also involved in examining and identifying the serious 

 systemic weaknesses in the anti-money laundering programs of certain jurisdictions, 

 known as Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCTs).  On 22 June 2001, the 

 FATF listed 19 NCCTs, including the following Asia-Pacific countries: 

 Cook Islands Marshall Islands Nauru Philippines 

 Indonesia  Myanmar  (Burma)  Niue  Russia  

 The FATF called on all its members to request their financial institutions to give 

 special attention to transactions with persons, companies and financial institutions in 

 these countries and territories. 

 On 31 December 2001, the FATF that further counter-measures should be introduced, 

 on a gradual and proportionate basis, to cover the recording of financial transactions 

 from NCCTs.  These additional counter-measures were: 

 â¢ Stringent requirements for identifying clients and enhancement of advisories to  financial institutions for identifying beneficial owners before business  relationships are established; 

 â¢ Enhanced relevant reporting mechanisms for suspicious transactions; 

 â¢ Review the requests for the establishment in any FATF country of branches or  subsidiaries of banks for NCCTs; 

 

 29   Membership of the FATF currently comprises Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,  Canada, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Gulf Cooperation  Council, Hong Kong/China, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New  Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and  the United States.  In addition, there are five “FATF-Style” Regional Bodies and 14 International  Organisations that have observer status on the FATF.  30

   Membership of the APG currently comprises Australia, Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Cook  Islands, Fiji, Hong Kong/China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Macau/China, Malaysia, New Zealand, Niue,  Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United States and  Vanuatu.  In addition, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Myanmar (Burma), Nepal and Vietnam have  observer status, along with 13 International or Regional Organisations.

 â¢ Warning the non-financial sector that business with entities within NCCTs might  run the risk of being associated with money laundering. 

 Terrorists frequently finance their operations through criminal activity, or they may 

 also use funding from legitimate sources.  In either case, terrorist groups utilise 

 financial networks in the same way that other criminal groups do.  That is, they move 

 funds and hide connections between the source of their funding and the perpetrators, 

 organisers, and sponsors of their activity.  The FATF’s work on underground banking 

 (hawala) and alternative remittance systems, laundering mechanisms that play a role 

 in some criminal and terrorist laundering operations, is also given a high priority. 

 In October 2001, the FATF promulgated 8 Recommendations to deny terrorists and 

 their supporters access to the international finance system.  In brief, these 

 recommendations were: 

 1. Immediately take steps to ratify the United Nations Convention on the  Suppression of Terrorist Financing, 1999; 

 2. Criminalise the financing of terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist organisations;  

 3. Freeze and confiscate terrorist assets; 

 4. Require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions that may be  linked to terrorism; 

 5. Assist other country’s investigation of terrorist financing networks; 

 6. Improve money laundering requirements on alternative remittance systems; 

 7. Strengthen customer identification requirements for domestic and international  wire transfers; 

 8. Take steps to ensure that non-profit organisations are not misused to finance  terrorist groups. 

 The FATF met in Hong Kong between 30 January and 1 February 2001 to review 

 progress in this area, and to begin to identify countries that are not taking appropriate 

 measures to counter terrorist financing.  These countries will be expected to be 

 compliant by June 2002, or they may face sanctions. 

 The Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units [http://www1.oecd.org/fatf/Ctry-orgpages/org-egmont_en.htm], was formally established in 1995 to provide a forum 

 for national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs)31 to improve support to their 

 respective national anti-money laundering programs.  This support includes 

 expanding and systematising the exchange of financial intelligence, improving 

  15

 expertise and capabilities of the personnel of such organisations, and fostering better 

 communication among FIUs through the application of new technologies.  FIUs play 

 a key role in identifying and tracking terrorist finance. 

 The Wolfsberg Group [http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/], established in October 

 2000, consists of twelve leading international private banks, operating in collaboration 

 with Transparency International, a Berlin-based NGO dedicated to increasing 

 government accountability and curbing both international and national corruption.  

 The Wolfsberg Group is currently examining such issues as: 

 â¢ Practical measures to investigate lists of terrorists, terrorist organisations, and so  on, provided by Governments or law enforcement agencies, to determine the  whereabouts of their funds and the measures necessary to freeze them; 

 â¢ Issues related to correspondent banking, particularly as it concerns “shell banks”  in NCCTs; 

 â¢ Record-keeping on foreign bank ownership; 

 â¢ Exchanging information on suspicious broker-dealer activities; 

 â¢ Examining measures to identify and deal with non-traditional funds transfer  methods. 

 The Wolfsberg Group met last in Wolfsberg between 9-11 January 2002 to develop a 

 set of best practice guidelines for traditional finance institutions investigating the 

 financing of terrorism. 

 As an example of the seriousness of this work, it was recently established that 22 

 United States securities firms surveyed had more than 45,000 off-shore clients with an 

 estimated US$140 billion in assets in their accounts.  Obviously sophisticated 

 computer analysis is playing a key role in tracking money laundering and terrorist 

 financing in this area. 

 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision [http://www.bis.org/bcbs/], established 

 by the Central Bank Governors of the Group of Ten Countries32 at the end of 1974.  

 Its objective is to formulate broad supervisory standards and guidelines, and 

 recommend best practice in the expectation that individual authorities will take steps 

 to implement them through detailed arrangements - statutory or otherwise - which are 

 

 31   As at 4 February 2002, there were 58 countries with FIUs which participate in the Egmont  Group.

 best suited to their own national systems.  Its work in the area of “due diligence” is of 

 particular relevance to countering money laundering and the funding of terrorist 

 organisations.  The Committee’s Secretariat is provided by the Bank for International 

 Settlements (BIS) in Basel. 

 The G-2033, established in Washington on 25 September 1999, comprises the Finance 

 Ministers and Central Bank Governors of 19 countries, the European Union and the 

 Bretton Woods Institutions (the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank).  

 The g-20 promotes discussion, and studies and reviews policy issues among 

 industrialised countries and emerging markets, with a view to promoting international 

 financial stability.   

 On 17 November 2001, the G-20 promulgated a comprehensive plan of multilateral 

 cooperation to deny terrorists access to their financial systems, through a number of 

 concrete steps designed to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. 

 United Nations Initiative 

 Prior to 11 September 2001, only four countries34 had ratified the United National 

 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 1999.  

 This Convention establishes that it is an offence for a person “by any means, directly 

 or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention 

 that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, 

 in order to carry out” a terrorist act.35   

 However, with the huge increase in international concern about the terrorist financing, 

 the Convention came into force on 10 April, by which time 132 countries had signed 

 the Convention and 26 had ratified it, four more than the 22 required.  The 

 Convention calls for stepped up efforts to identify, detect and freeze or seize funds 

 earmarked for terrorist acts and urges states to use such funds to compensate victims 

 and their families.  It also calls on financial institutions to report to their governments 

 

 32   Current membership of the Basel Committee comprises Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the  United States.  33

   Membership of the G-20 comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France,  Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea,  Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union.  34

 any unusual or suspicious transactions.  States that are party to the Convention must 

 prosecute offenders or extradite them to nations that suffered from their illegal acts.  

 They must cooperate in investigations and may not, for example, refuse a request for 

 assistance on grounds of banking secrecy. They must also update their laws to comply 

 with the provisions of the Convention.36 

 In addition to the above, an ad hoc committee of the Legal Committee of the United 

 Nations General Assembly is developing a draft International Convention Against 

 Terrorism that will codify the outlaw the financing of terrorism.  However, at this 

 stage, the committee has been unable to agree on a definition of terrorism, to find a 

 way to distinguish a terrorist from a freedom fighter, and unable to agree on excluding 

 state forces from anti-terrorism provisions (i.e. the problem of “state terrorism”).  

 Also, at the initiative of the Russian Federation, the Legal Committee is working on a 

 new convention or protocol to address the suppression of nuclear terrorism.37 

 Statement of G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors 

 The G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors met on 9-10 February 2002 

 to discuss the global economy, the importance of fostering development and ongoing 

 efforts to combat the financing of terrorism.  At the end of the meeting, they issued a 

 progress report on combating the Financing of terrorism.  A copy of this report may 

 be found at Annex “B”. 

 Conclusion 

 The international response to the need to track and freeze terrorist finance and counter 

 conventional money laundering, since 11 September 2001, has been most impressive.  

 It also complements other international measures against both transnational terrorism 

 and transnational crime.  However, much of this is still “work in progress” at both the 

 national and international levels.

 The measures taken as a result of the investigations following the events of 11 

 September 2001 have flowed on to facilitate the investigations of money laundering 

 and money movements relating to more conventional criminal issues, such as major 

 drug cases and the investigation of fraud, white collar crime, capital flight, and more 

 generally the nexus between the legitimate and illegitimate business practices 

 undertaken by transnational organised crime groups.38   

 The Response to Terrorism 

 Transnational terrorism requires a multi-faceted response: 

 â¢ Law enforcement response: 

 o Requires large resources to be diverted from normal law enforcement; 

 o Requires high priority and enhanced intelligence exchanges; 

 o Utilises joint operational activities; 

 o Relies on extradition and mutual support; 

 o Must attack and neutralise the terrorist financial base. 

 â¢ Military response: 

 o Is not generally regarded as a core military war-fighting task; 

 o Can only be used selectively; 

 o It is very hard to neutralise the target through military means alone; 

 o Any foreign direct military intervention is generally unacceptable. 

 â¢ Intelligence community response: 

 o It is a very difficult target to attack.  Imagery is of limited value if there are  few fixed bases; communications intelligence (COMINT) of limited vale if  conventional communications channels are not used; money movement of  limited value if non-conventional banking methods employed.  There needs to  be much more emphasis on Human intelligence (HUMINT). 

 o Needs real-time data, involving processing a large volume of material which  may need deciphering, translation, analysis and dissemination. 

 o Must overcome traditional cultural introversion and elitism of the intelligence  community to facilitate exchange with the law enforcement community and  overseas intelligence and law enforcement agencies.  Transnational crime and  terrorism are global threats that can only be neutralised by a global response. 

 â¢ Political/strategic response: 

 

 38   For example, in January 2002, the United States Department of Treasury Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published an SAR Bulletin (Suspicious Activity Report), which  examined five significant cases of terrorist financing, and provided 23 very useful indicators, most of  which are applicable to both terrorist and transnational crime investigations. 

  19

 o Needs to attack the root causes of terrorism.  Why are people doing this?  Why  are people so angry?  Why are they prepared to kill themselves for the cause?   Is this a religious problem or are there other causes (and therefore the  solutions) of a much broader nature? 

 o Needs to recognise that we are living in a very complex and changing global  environment.  Has our thinking moved on to embrace these changes?  Do our  national strategies reflect these changes? 

 o Should take not that the consistent line of criticism from a very broad  spectrum of the international Islamic community is that the United States and  its allies have mishandled the Israel/Palestine situation; they are concerned at  the continuing presence of foreign military forces in Saudi Arabia (where the  most sacred sites of Islam are located); they continue to be critical of the  impact of United Nations sanctions on the ordinary people of Iraq; and they  criticise the overwhelming dominance of United States military power and its  deployment where civilian casualties are suffered.  We may not agree with  these propositions, but if we do not try to understand them and make such  adjustments as may be necessary to accommodate at least some of these  concerns, we should not be surprised if we face the trauma of further 911  attacks, only possibly next time employing much greater risks, such as the use  of weapons of mass destruction.

  Annex “A” 

 Brief Description of Organised Crime Groups in China, Hong Kong, Macau and  Taiwan   

 China’s increasing role as a source area of international criminal activity , including greater worldwide  influence of Chinese criminal syndicates, has paralleled its emergence as a global economic power and  Beijing’s opening to foreign investment.  … Since the early 1990s more than half of the heroin  produced in Burma now transits Yunnan Province and the other regions of China on its way to drug  markets in China itself and in North America and Australia.  Fujian Province is a major base of  operations for criminal brokers known as “snakeheads” who, using contacts around the world,  orchestrate the movement of illegal Chinese immigrants (overseas).  Legitimate textile works, factories,  and high-tech manufacturers in Guangdong Province are major producers of pirated and counterfeit  products. … The entrepreneurial stake of many Chinese officials in various business enterprises -fully  legitimate or otherwise - lends itself to criminal activity for profit. … Beijing’s policy of inviting  overseas Chinese businessmen to trade and invest in China, have allowed powerful Chinese triad   criminal organisations from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to establish strong footholds on the  mainland, especially southern China 39 

 As one of the world’s leading commercial, financial and transportation centres, Hong Kong has long  been the hub of criminal activity in East Asia - a status that has not changed since China assumed  sovereignty over the territory in 1997.  The massive volume of trade in containerised shipping through  Hong Kong (16 million containers annually) offers substantial opportunity for criminals to smuggle all  kinds of contraband, including drugs and arms, and illegal immigrants. … Hong Kong’s status as one  of the world’s most developed financial centres makes it vulnerable to attempts to use its financial  institutions for laundering illicit profits.  Wide-ranging links to the international business community  and the modern banking sector in Hong Kong provide extensive cover for money-laundering operations  and for financing illicit activities.40 

 Since Macau’s reversion to Chinese administration in 1999, organised crime continues to have  substantial influence over the enclave’s economy.  Organised crime groups still dominate Macau’s  gaming industry, the primary engine of its economy.  In addition to the substantial revenues they  generate of their own accord, gambling and prostitution rackets in Macau are used by local and other  crime groups for money laundering. … Local and national Chinese law enforcement authorities have  been working to diminish the power of organised crime in Macau. … Although triad involvement in  casinos and other businesses remains a serious problem, there has been a marked decline in organised  crime-related violence in Macau. … The weakness of Macau’s laws to combat money laundering  remains a serious problem.41 

 Organised crime is deeply entrenched in Taiwan’s business and political sectors.  Large ethnic Chinese  criminal syndicates … which followed the ruling Kuomingtang party from the mainland to Taiwan in  the late 1940s, and Taiwanese criminal gangs have established strong influence in Taiwan’s local  communities. … Although the .organised crime problem in Taiwan is largely domestic, Taiwan-based  criminal groups use the island’s extensive international trade and financial links to further their illegal  activities overseas. … Some Taiwanese-based triads have links to Hong Kong and China, including  establishing front companies or investing in specific criminal ventures. … Political corruption and the  ties of former ruling party politicians to organised crime continue to be potent political issues in  Taiwan.42

 Brief Description of Organised Crime Groups in the Republic of Korea (ROK)   

 It is typical for organised crime groups to gain enormous illicit profits through gambling, drugs,  prostitution and smuggling.  In Korea, the massive organised violent groups (for example, the yakuza  in Japan, mafia in Italy and triads in China) have not yet developed.  Fortunately, there are no signs  that major organised criminal groups in Korea are involved in drug trafficking and manufacture so far.  … Recently, a few illicit trafficking cases were involved with international drug syndicates  such as  14K/United Bamboo Gang, Nigerian cells and Russian mafiya were detected. … A new Special Act in  1995, with the provision that any member of an organisation committed of committing drug trafficking  as a business can be punished up to the death penalty, is now under legislation.47   

 Korean organised crime groups exist in cities overseas with a large Korean population.  One source  claimed in 1994 that ethnic Korean groups headquartered in Japan and affiliated with the boryokudan  (or yakuza) control ninety percent of the flow of crystal methamphetamine (“ice”) to Hawaii.48 

 While the level of organised crime in Korea, or involving Koreans abroad, is limited in comparison  with some other countries in the region, the Republic has faced very serious problems as a result of  deeply entrenched corruption and white collar crime which are linked to entrepreneurial politicians,  businessmen and bureaucrats, rather than organised crime groups.  This activity has included  widespread bribery,49 fraud (including electoral fraud), embezzlement, capital flight, tax evasion, loans  to bankrupt companies, the illicit exploitation of fishing resources of other countries and the misuse of  the resources of the intelligence community for party political purposes.  Not only have Chairmen or  senior officials of several of the Korean chaebols (corporate conglomerates) been convicted of bribery,  but in 1996 two former Presidents (Roh Tae Woo and Chun Doo Hwan) were imprisoned for massive  corruption, before being pardoned by President Kim Dae Jung in December 1997.50

 Brief Description of Organised Crime Groups in the Democratic Peoples’  Republic of Korea (DPRK) 

 It is increasingly clear that not only are key figures within the North Korean regime involved in  transnational organised crime, but that the state itself has criminalised itself as a matter of policy. … In  this respect, North Korea is metamorphosing into a true “criminal state”.53  

 There have been regular reports from many official and unofficial sources for at least the last 20 to 30  years that the DPRK encourages illicit opium cultivation and engages in trafficking of opiates and other  narcotic drugs as a criminal state enterprise. … Even the North Koreans admit that opium is grown  there, while maintaining it is used for medicines and painkillers. … This past year’s drug seizure  reports seem to point to more trafficking in amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), and less in heroin and  opium.  Estimates of opium production in the DPRK vary from 30 MT to 44 MT: this would yield from  about 3 to 4.5 MT of heroin. … (However) agricultural problems in North Korea, including flooding  and shortages of fertilizer and insecticides, suggest that current opium production might be well below  these estimates.. There has also been a very clear shift in Asian drug abuse away from opium towards  methamphetamine-type drugs. … North Korea is reportedly stepping up its manufacturing capacity for  methamphetamine production. … Russia54 and China are the key markets and transit routes for North  Korean drug, (with an) expanding illicit market in Japan.55 … Drugs have also been reported to have  been transferred from North Korean trawlers at sea.56  It was estimated by the South Korean authorities  in 1996 that the profit from narcotics trafficking nets North Korea US$300 million per year.57 

 There have been a number of incidents publicly revealed where North Korean diplomats have been  involved in trafficking in illicit drugs.58  

 … there have been many other incidents  and arrests which suggest North Korean state involvement in  other criminal enterprises.  Among the crimes more frequently mentioned are counterfeiting, illicit  trade in endangered species, fraudulent antiques, counterfeit CDs, tapes and cigarettes. … There is  considerable evidence suggesting North Korean complicity in illicit activities, indeed direction of illicit  activities, but almost all of that evidence is subject to alternative explanations, which put the blame on  the individual or on the entity where the individual works.59  It remains unclear whether alleged North

 Korean involvement in illicit activities results from state policy, or is simply the actions of criminal  individuals or entities. … However … it seems more likely that the state itself is involved in drug  manufacture and trafficking.60 61

This  office  is  reported  to  be  in  charge  of  drug  trafficking,  and   according  to  some  reports,  all  crime-for-profit  activity,  including  opium   production  and  trafficking,  methamphetamine  production  and  trafficking,   counterfeiting and smuggling. 

 According  to  Galeotti  some  sources  suggested  that  in  1997  (Bureau  No.  39)  generated  an   estimated US$86 million of which $71 million came from drug trafficking.  Others have put  this figure as high as $500 to $ 1 billion.  The “best guess” estimate for 2000 appears to be  $150 - 200 million, of which 75 - 85% comes from narcotics: this is equivalent to almost  half of the country’s total legal export trade.  [Galeotti, op cit., p.10]  62

   These gangs are closely associated with the yakuza.  63   Some authorities have, in the past, assessed these remittances at between $500 million to  $1billion per year.

In the 1980s, terrorists linked to the DPRK used Macau as a base for the bombing, on 9  October 1983, of a group of South Korean ministers and officials visiting Rangoon at the time.  21  people were killed.  Furthermore, terrorists linked to the DPRK were alleged to have been involved in  the bombing of a Korean Airlines Boeing 707 airliner en route from Baghdad to Seoul on 29 November  1987.  115 people were killed.  The DPRK denied involvement in both incidents.

  Galeotti claims that 25% of the amphetamines trafficked into Japan comes from the DPRK.   The DPRK is also involved in manufacturing “designer drugs” such as the “date rape” drug, rohypnol  tablets (“roofies”).  [Galeotti, op cit., p. 11].

 Brief Description of Organised Crime Groups in Japan 

 Japanese crime syndicates, known as yakuza,67 have exploited their traditional roles in arbitrating  disputes and loan collection to gain a wide measure of public acceptance.  The yakuza’s practice of  sokaiya, corporate extortion, often by threatening to disrupt corporate shareholder meetings, has been  generally tolerated by Japanese society, despite the economic influence it has given organised crime. …  The yakuza were able to cash in on Japan’s economic and real estate boom in the 1980s to expand their  profit-making activities beyond their traditional criminal arenas of drugs, gambling, prostitution and  corporate extortion.  Housing loan companies, jusen, that were affiliated with major Japanese banks  reportedly issued a portion of their loans, many of which were not repaid, to yakuza-tied firms as part  of the speculative boom in real estate. … As a result, the yakuza were behind many of the problem  loans leading to the 1996 collapse of the jusen mortgage industry. … One expert on Japanese crime  believes that yakuza interests may have directly accounted for 10 percent of the banking industry’s bad  loans, which he estimated as high as $700 million, and an additional 30 percent of the bad loans may  have been indirectly tied to yakuza affiliations.68 

 The yakuza are among the world’s largest and most powerful criminal confederations.  The yakuza are  highly structured and criminally diverse organisations that have thoroughly penetrated Japanese  society, including the legitimate economic sphere, through their extortion-like practice of sokaiya.   There are an estimated 3,000 yakuza groups and subgroups based in Japan.  According o Japan’s  National Police Agency, 60 percent of the estimated 90,000 members and associates of yakuza families  are affiliated with one of three groups: the Yamaguchi-Gumi, Sumiyoshi-Kai and Inagawa-Kai.  These  groups control most organised criminal activity in Japan, including gun trafficking, drug smuggling,  alien smuggling, prostitution, illegal gambling, extortion and white collar crime through infiltration of  legitimate businesses.  Academic specialists on Japanese organised crime have estimated the annual  revenue of the yakuza as about $13 billion.69 

 “Anti-yakuza” legislation implemented in the early 1990s and updated in 1997 … (including) a  nationwide crackdown on sokaiya appears to have curbed some organised crime activities.  Despite the  yakuza ethnic Chinese criminal gangs linked to illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and arms  trafficking are publicly perceived as the most serious criminal threats to Japan.70 

 Within Japan, a large number of ethnic Koreans have become members of the yakuza, particularly in  Osaka and Kobe.  These people are generally from  disadvantaged groups with the Japanese  community, known as burakumin or “untouchables”.71 

 Although not normally recognised as an organised crime group, the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo sect,  formed in 1987, is of particular importance because it is a religious organisation which engaged in very  serious crime, including murder, torture, and extortion, as well as manufacturing, testing or using  chemical or biological agents, with the objective of precipitating conflict between Japan and the United  States.  Recruitment of members focused on socially disaffected individuals with technical and  scientific backgrounds, many of whom also possessed or had access to substantive economic resources.   At the height of its power, the Aum sect was reported to have assets of between $1 - $2 billion.  Not  only was Aum Shinrikyo successful in penetrating the Japanese bureaucracy, military and police, but  they also established chapters in a number of countries overseas, including Russia, where they claimed  a membership of 30,000 (three times their membership in Japan), and also obtained access at a very  high level in the Russian Government and military.

 Prior to their sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995 the group attempted to use sarin to  kill the judges presiding over a murder case involving the Aum sect.  It was also reported that the sect  planned to carry out an attack against the New York underground.  IN an effort to alleviate public  pressure and criticism, in September 2000, the Aum sect leaders announced that they would suspend the  sect’s public activities for an indeterminate period, commencing 1 October 2000.72

 Brief Description of Organised Crime Groups in the Russian Far East 

 Powerful Russian criminal organisations with international networks are one of the most troubling and  dangerous legacies of the former Soviet Union. … According to the (Russian Ministry of the Interior),  there are 89 criminal communities in Russia that comprise about 1,000 smaller criminal groups. …  there are about 200 sophisticated organised crime groups in Russia with a broad range of operations,  some of which extend beyond Russia’s borders into some 60 different countries.  They (cultivate)  mutually beneficial relationships with government officials and politicians to become powerful players  in Russian politics and society.  Most Russian criminal organisations are located in industrial and  commercial centres, giving them (the) opportunity to make inroads into lucrative sectors of the Russian  economy. 

 Russian crime groups are characterised by ruthlessness and violence, and many are very well armed -  presenting a formidable challenge to Russian law enforcement elements, which are often outgunned,  and under-funded particularly at the local level.  There is no apparent supreme hierarchy among  Russian organised crime groups, nor is any one group masterminding the activities of the others.   Instead, Russian criminal organisations have their own spheres of influence that are generally defined  by geography, ethnicity, and, in some cases, specific criminality.  The international presence of Russian  organised crime … is most pronounced in Eastern and Central Europe, where Russian crime groups are  involved in narcotics and weapons trafficking, car theft, and financial crimes.  Russian organised crime  money laundering operations have been observed in off-shore banking centres in the South pacific,  Cyprus, and various Caribbean islands as well as in Eastern European economies.  These groups tend to  mount large-scale financial fraud schemes. 

 Russian criminals take advantage of places that are most attractive to Russian businessmen and tourists,  using them as cover and opportunity to engage in a broad range of criminal activities . -  extortion  rackets, prostitution rings, trade in black-market consumer goods and drugs, and to launder money. …  Russian crime groups are also attracted to countries that have liberal cash circulation laws, few  restrictions on direct investment, and allow non-residents to establish businesses.  Investments in real  estate, tourist and entertainment sectors, interest in banks and financial services companies, and the  establishment of front companies … provide a ready haven for laundering and hiding illicit profits  earned there and smuggled out of Russia … They have used their ties to Italian criminal groups to  establish extensive businesses in Italy - investing as much as $4 - $7 billion between 1993 and 1995  alone. … Russian and Italian criminals cooperate in international drug trafficking, arms smuggling and  counterfeiting.74 

 Russia currently finds itself in an unprecedented position in which its primary security concerns are  largely internal.  The Russian Far East’s military industrial complexes, which asserted Soviet military  power in the Pacific, have found defence conversion in the post-Cold War era difficult to achieve. …  over the long term the RFE must convert most of its economy to civilian purposes. … However, the  scope and magnitude of (Russia’s) security concerns are so tremendous that their cumulative effect has  resulted in a “comprehensive insecurity syndrome” … - endemic corruption, drug trafficking,  environmental pollution, technological breakdowns, energy and food supply shortages, and violent  outbreaks of terrorism and separatism.  

 … Lacking sufficient finances for the adequate technical decisions, the FSB and the Ministry of the  Interior implemented a series of joint preventive actions to support nuclear complex security and to  stop economic crimes and the illegal sales of armaments. 75 … Criminal forces may be exerting  additional pressures on the directors, engineers and workers at regional nuclear facilities that may cause  them to violate the security regimes at these facilities. … The decline of the Pacific Fleet has had a  profound impact on the criminal underworld, increasing the chances that ports and other points of  access to nuclear facilities may be compromised. … (One) facility experienced serious difficulties in

 the 1990s with labour unrest, a murder-for-hire, and incidents involving attempted smuggling of  nuclear materials, blueprints and technologies. … One area of particular concern is the possibility that  facilities with nuclear material and technologies might fall under the control of the local mafiya.76  In Russia … the transportation and sale of illegal narcotics are now being described as a security threat.   The Russian Far East, geographically proximate to North Korea and the drug routes of Central and  Southeast Asia, is particularly susceptible.77

 Annex “B”   

 G-7 Progress Report on Combating the Financing of Terrorism   

 G-7 countries have been joined by over 200 other countries and jurisdictions in  expressing support for the fight against terrorist financing. Our October 2001 Action  Plan to Combat the Financing of Terrorism contributed to this international effort by  setting out clear priorities: vigorous application of international sanctions, including  the freezing of terrorist assets; rapid development and implementation of international  standards; increased information sharing among countries; and enhanced efforts by  financial supervisors to guard against the abuse of the financial sector by terrorists.    

 Significant results have already been achieved. Since September 11, almost 150  countries and jurisdictions have issued orders to freeze terrorist assets, and over $US  100 million has been frozen worldwide. Each G7 country is implementing UN  Security Council Resolution 1373 and has signed and is committed to ratifying the  UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The Financial  Action Task Force (FATF) has agreed to a set of Special Recommendations on  Terrorist Financing and is implementing a comprehensive action plan encouraging all  countries to adopt them. All G-7 countries have established or are in the process of  establishing Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) that will facilitate the sharing of  information on money laundering and terrorist financing. We have also all established  mechanisms to share information relating to the tracking of terrorist assets.    

 Continued success requires even closer cooperation and an intensified commitment.  We now set forth the following steps to further advance the global fight against  terrorist financing:  

 â¢ To enhance international coordination in the freezing of terrorist assets, we  will develop a mutual understanding of the information requirements and the  procedures that different countries can use to undertake freezing actions. We will  also develop key principles regarding the information to be shared, the procedures  for sharing it, and the protection of sensitive information. We will also work with  other countries to identify jointly terrorists whose assets would be subject to  freezing. We will continue to review our institutional structures to ensure that they  facilitate the international flow of information necessary to identify, track, and  stop the flow of terrorist funds. In this regard, we support the Egmont Group’s  work on improved information flow among FIUs.  

 â¢ The G-7 are committed to fully implementing by June 2002 the FATF  standards against terrorist financing. We urge all countries to accept the FATF’s  invitation to take part in a self-assessment and to commit to the rapid  implementation of the standards. We look to the FATF, IMF and the World Bank  to quickly complete their collaborative work on a framework for assessing  compliance with international standards, including all FATF recommendations,  against money laundering and terrorist financing. We urge all countries that have  not done so by February 1, 2002, to implement the measures set out in the  November 2001 CommuniquÃ© of the International Monetary and Financial  Committee of the IMF, and look forward to the IMF’s report to the spring meeting  of the Committee on all issues raised by the CommuniquÃ©.  We urge the Basle  Committee on Banking Supervision to review its enhanced customer due diligence 

  32

 standards for banks to ensure that they address terrorist financing, and the  Financial Stability Forum to review its role in combating terrorist financing,  including in relation to offshore financial centres.  

 â¢ We look forward to the quick implementation of the IMF and World Bank  plan to provide increased technical assistance for measures to combat money  laundering and terrorist financing in coordination with the FATF, regional FATF-style bodies, the UN and the Egmont Group. For our part, G-7 countries are  committed to providing technical assistance on a bilateral basis as well as through  these coordination mechanisms.  

 We recognize that continued success in the fight against terrorist financing requires the 

 close cooperation and unwavering commitment of the broad international community. 

 We therefore encourage all countries to join us in implementing these measures
