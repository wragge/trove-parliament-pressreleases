 PRIME MINISTER 

 THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPT   

 20 November 2015 

 

 Doorstop  

 Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin 

 

 E&OE…    

 

 NATASHA GRIGGS MP:    

 I'm really delighted that the Prime Minister has accepted my invitation to come here so quickly, and  particularly that he's had such a huge schedule overseas, and so I'm very grateful that you have come  here, Malcolm. 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 It's good to be here. It's always fun to be here in Darwin.  

 Thank you Natasha and Alan and Vice Chancellor.  

 I just want to thank the Vice Chancellor and Alan Cass for their great work here at the Menzies School of  Medical Research. I want to thank Natasha for inviting me here, and for the great job she is doing as the  Member for Solomon. This Centre is absolutely critical in the fight to ensure better health for Indigenous  Australians and, of course, you’ve heard from Rick Price, the work it's doing right across the region in the  battle against malaria.  

 I'm really impressed with the standard of the research as of course, more importantly, is the NH&MRC,  because Menzies does so much better than anyone else in terms of securing grants which is a great  judgement, if you like, the judgement of their peers in terms of determining the quality of the research.  

 As Natasha said, and as I said in my remarks a moment ago in the auditorium, Darwin is really at one of  the most interesting points in the most exciting time in human history. The pace of change has never 

 been so rapid as it is today. The pace of change, in the history of human development, has never been  so fast.  

 Just look at China alone. 40 years ago, it was barely part of the global economy, now it is either the  second or the first-largest national economy in the world today.   

 The pace of that change has been extraordinary and it's happening of course in Indonesia, it’s happening  in Vietnam, it’s happening in Malaysia, Singapore, all through the region. Here is Darwin right on the  edge of that.  

 Darwin is the gateway between Northern Australia and those big Asian markets and that's why it's  terrific to see so much great research being done here in this very exciting, dynamic 21st-century city.  But yet, one as [inaudible] reminded us, that is one with an indigenous heritage that goes back tens of  thousands of years. So yes, it's great to be here in Darwin, a city with very deep roots, very deep and  ancient roots, but thoroughly a modern city, a 21st century city with the most exciting. I’ll say that again,  Darwin is a city with very ancient roots, very ancient groups but it is a thoroughly modern 21st century  city with a very exciting future.  

 JOURNALIST:  

 You said on the radio this morning that you didn’t think there were defence concerns about the leasing  of the Darwin port because the military doesn't use that area, but the military basically does use the Fort  Hill Wharf section of the port. Is there not something that should be re-looked at there? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 The Northern Territory Government consulted with the Department of Defence, quite some time ago,  and the Defence Department's conclusion was that the sale, given the conditions on the sale and so  forth, did not pose concerns for the Department of Defence. And Dennis Richardson, the Secretary, has  been out in the public explaining that. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Did they, though, do all the research needed to determine any military or Chinese Government links  with this company, because it wasn't given the full Foreign Investment Review Board workover? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 The Department of Defence, I am sure, did their homework as you would expect them to do. They are  more aware than most of those issues, I can assure you. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 But surely there must be some concern, I mean there are reviews that are going to be undertaken, are  there not? What reviews are going to be undertaken by the Federal Government to make sure that it  might have a better say in the leasing of such infrastructure? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 What the Treasurer is doing is talking to states and territories about this reality that we have under our  current foreign takeover rules, under which the FIRB, the Foreign Investment Review Board supervises,  the sales by state and territory governments are not caught by that jurisdiction. Having said that; so the  first question is should there be a more formalised legal process of consultation with the FIRB and that is  what Scott is talking to the states and territories about. I am sure we will work out a mechanism.  

 Having said that, in respect of this port lease, there was a consultation, as recommended by the NT  Parliament's own committee. There was a consultation with the Department of Defence, which the  Department of Defence conducted, and this has happened some time ago, and the conclusion was that  they were happy for the sale to this party, Landbridge, to proceed. Dennis Richardson, who is the  Secretary of the Department of Defence, has explained that publicly.  

 I don't think we should be critical of the NT Government. They did the right thing. They consulted with  the Department of Defence and the Department of Defence came back and said no, that is fine. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Prime Minister, why are you reviewing the rules then, if everything is fine? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Why are we reviewing the rules? The reason we are reviewing the rules is not because we regret the  decision made by - the advice given by the Department of Defence but just that it clearly makes sense  for all foreign acquisitions of the relevant size to be subject to the same process. That is purely an  orderly administrative thing to do, to make sure that there aren't gaps in the law. That is a gap that has  been there for some time.  

 Having said that, I just want to stress that the Northern Territory Government did the right thing, they  consulted with the Department of Defence and the advice they got from the Department of Defence  was that the sale from Defence's point of view could proceed. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 [inaudible]... the US decision overnight to make refugees from Syria and Iraq submit to background  checks, what is your reaction to that [inaudible]?  

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 We have, can I say, refugees that come to Australia, before they are accepted to Australia, are subject to  rigorous background checks now. They have been for a very long time, probably forever and certainly  for many years.  

 You would have seen the Director-General of ASIO, Duncan Lewis, on the 7.30 Report earlier in the  week, explaining the extent of those background checks.  

 I can assure all Australians that the refugees, whether they are among the 12,000 that will be coming  from the Syrian theatre - Syrian conflict - or from other sources, all refugees go through very thorough  and extensive background checks and in particular security checks and that is why ASIO takes such a  keen interest in it. That has always been the case.  

 Can I just have one more and then that’s it, I must run. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 A boat has just arrived, it has just been spotted off the coast of Christmas Island, probably not more  than 300 meters. Can you comment on that and also say if there are children on board, will they be sent  to Manus Island? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 As you know, we don't comment on operational matters. I can't help you other than to say that we do  not comment on operational matters. Thank you very much. 

 Ends
