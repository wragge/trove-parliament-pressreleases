 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats  

 4th February 2003  MEDIA RELEASE    03/053             

 

 

 RUDDOCK EXPOSED BY HIGH COURT DECISION   

 

 In a decision handed down today the High Court determined that the privative clause introduced in the  Migration Act in 2001 did not apply to decisions affected by jurisdictional error.    

 The Australian Democrats today criticised the Government for wasting taxpayers’ money and  misleading the public about changes made to the Migration Act rushed through before the last Federal  election.    

 Leader of the Australian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “ This proves that judicial review of  migration decisions still exists and is here to stay. It constitutes a failure of Government to implement  its policy.     

 “In effect, the Court has said the Immigration Minister’s interpretation of this clause would be  unconstitutional.    

 “The critical point here is that the decision making power of the Court remains unchanged.   

 “The Minister has misled the Australian people in his attempts to deny justice to those who most need  it,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “Minister Ruddock has attempted to systematically remove all access to an independent decision maker  by removing the right of refugees to seek review in the Federal Court, and then by seeking to prevent  access to the High Court.   

 “The Minister’s determination to prevent independent review will only increase the backlog of cases  before the High Court.    

 “Australia is now in a ridiculous situation whereby the High Court now sits on ordinary migration cases  which are forced there through actions by the Minister,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 The Democrats called on the Minister to amend the Act to allow merits review of migration decisions  by the Federal Court, but warned him against attempting any amendments, which would overturn the  decision of the High Court and further waste taxpayers’ money.
