 SINGLETON INVOLVEMENT IN DETENTION CONTINGENCY PLAN

 Thursday, August 23, 2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Phillip Ruddock, today announced plans to increase the contingency capacity for detaining unauthorised boat arrivals, which will involve Singleton in the Upper Hunter.

 Work will begin shortly on an initial processing point on HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin for unauthorised boat people. This will be a temporary centre until a permanent immigration reception and detention centre is built in Darwin.

 Preparations will also begin for a contingency immigration detention centre at the defence facility at Singleton in NSW and at El Alamein near Port Augusta in South Australia. The establishment of a facility at El Alamein will be larger than Singleton and once it is operational, it will then be used as a contingency centre ahead of Singleton.

 “There is still 20% capacity in Australia’s current detention centre facilities that are still available for further boat arrivals,” Senator John Tierney said. “So the Singleton centre may in fact never be used. This is a contingency measure, using the facility that was made to temporarily accommodate Kosovar refugees two years ago.”

 “There are some people in our detention centres who are appealing their rejected claims for asylum through tribunals and the courts and as a result, prolonging the time they stay.

 “The announcement today by the Minister is a contingency plan in the event that further centres are required for a temporary basis, for families, women and children.

 “If the facilities at Singleton are used they will only be relied on as an interim measure, while new permanent facilities are constructed.”
