 MPS 85/96 GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER BALANCED MIGRATION PROGRAM

 The Government will deliver a planned and balanced migration program despite  obstruction from Labor, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip  Ruddock said today.

 Mr Ruddock has outlined some of the measures the Government will employ to  implement its policies and reclaim its ability to manage Australia's migration program.

 "The Government has attempted to restore balance to the migration program by  extending some of the management tools introduced by the former Government. Those  measures had received bipartisan support from the Coalition," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Opposition is now being hypocritical by claiming it supports the Government's  smaller program of 74,000 places, but it will not support measures to deliver the  program in a balanced, flexible and measured way."

 "Labor says it has delivered smaller programs without these measures. The reality is  it only delivered smaller numbers by demolishing skilled migration and because it had  chloroformed the economy into recession, so that no-one wanted to come here."

 In his statement the Minister has outlined new measures which are less flexible, but  remain the only options left open to deliver a program which balances Australia's social,  economic and environmental needs. The measures include: â¢ priority given to processing applications where the sponsor is an Australian 

 citizen

 â¢ priority given in the parent visa category to applicants where the majority of their  children live in Australia â¢ if necessary, as a last resort, using "cap and terminate" powers introduced under  Labor to limit numbers in the categories where the more flexible cap and queue 

 powers do not presently exist â¢ an extension of the existing list of Occupations Requiring English in the 

 Concessional Family category to improve the settlement and employment  prospects of migrants â¢ the counting of the immediate family of refugee and humanitarian entrants under  those categories, despite the Opposition's insistence that they enter under fee­

 paying family categories

 'These measures are not my first choice for managing the program, but this has been  forced upon the Government by the Opposition's lack of cooperation," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I would like to see a return to the cooperative approach that existed when I and some  of my colleagues held the shadow immigration portfolio. I would urge the Opposition  to reconsider its position, so that we can have more flexible measures in place."

 INFO SHEET DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION  AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

 8. MANAGING THE MIGRATION PROGRAM -  CHANGES TO PROCEDURES ANNOUNCED ON 13 DECEMBER 1996

 This information sheet summarises additional  migration procedures announced by the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Philip  Ruddock in a Statement to the House of  Representatives on 13 December 1996.

 The additional procedures have been introduced  following the disallowance in the Senate on 7  November 1996 of a number of changes to migration  regulations which had already taken effect.

 These had been announced by the Minister on and  after 3 July 1996, and had come into effect  progressively up to and including 1 November 1996.

 In summary, the key procedures announced on 13  December are as follows: (Note: where appropriate,  the corresponding disallowed measure is shown in  italics):

 ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS

 (Disallowed: the addition of 20 points for English  language ability in the Concessional Family*  category)

 The Government will now adopt a different approach  to English language skills, by expanding the  Occupations Requiring English (ORE) list.

 - Prospective migrants whose occupations are  listed on the ORE must demonstrate that they  have vocational level English, irrespective of  any other attributes they may have.

 The ORE list currently contains 115 occupations, and  is to be expanded to include most skilled  occupations. This will take effect for applications  decided from 1 July 1997 and will apply to migrants  in the Independent, Concessional Family and  Regional Family * categories.

 In 1995-96 about 23 per cent of applicants in the  Concessional Family category followed an  occupation on the list. After the expansion, it is  estimated that about 85 per cent of applicants will be  affected.

 CONCESSIONAL PASS MARK

 The Minister confirmed that the pass and pool mark  for Concessional Family applicants would remain at  the increased level of 115 and 110 points  respectively. The higher marks were needed as a 

 management tool to deal with the large pipeline of  applications that had built up.

 The higher levels were also necessary to address an  anomalous situation which had arisen as a result of  the disallowance motion.

 The disallowance removed the points for English  language ability for principal applicants in the  Concessional Family category, but left in place this  provision for the spouse of the principal applicant.

 PROCESSING PRIORITIES

 (Disallowed: the requirement for Preferential Family*  category migrants to be sponsored by Australian  citizens and the introduction of a new balance of  family test for people seeking to migrate as parents)

 The Minister announced a new General Direction for  migration officers providing guidance on processing  priorities to be applied from 12 December 1996 in  the Preferential Family category. The General 

 Direction sets out three priority groups:

 Group 1: Applications with the highest  processing priority:

 - children who apply under child visa subclass 101  and 802 in Australia or overseas

 - orphan relatives where there are special 

 circumstances of a compelling or compassionate  nature

 - adopted children or children for adoption  (subclass 102 visa applicants)

 - a spouse/fiance where the application includes a  dependent child of both the spouse/fiance  applicant and an Australian sponsor

 - immediate family members of Humanitarian  Program entrants or Protection visa holders  where either the relationship existed at the time  of visa grant for sponsors who entered under the 

 Humanitarian Program or application for  sponsors who are Protection Visa holders.

 This priority is not affected by whether the sponsor is  an Australian citizen or permanent resident or eligible  New Zealand citizen.

 Group 2: Applicants who have an Australian  citizen sponsor have the next processing  priority.

 - Parents who have the majority of their children  living in Australia should have a higher priority  than those parents who have only half or a  minority of their children living in Australia.

 Group 3: Applicants with sponsors who are not  Australian citizens have the lowest  priority.

 - In the case of an application by a parent within  this group, those who have a majority of their  children living in Australia should be given a  higher priority than applications by parents who 

 have only half or a minority of their children living  in Australia.

 Where visa applicants are waiting in a queue in the  Preferential Family category because a cap or limit  (see below) on that visa class has been reached, when  the cap is lifted their applications will be processed in 

 chronological order based on when they reached grant  stage, except in exceptional circumstances.

 HUMANITARIAN FAMILIES

 (Disallowed: the inclusion of immediate family  members* of Humanitarian Program entrants and  Protection Visa holders in the Humanitarian Program  intake, rather than the Preferential Family category as  at present, so that they had access to welfare services  and benefits immediately)

 Non-humanitarian migrants, such as Preferential  Family applicants, pay an application fee for migration  and then wait some months while the application is  processed. On arrival they are not able to obtain some  social security benefits for six months.

 Humanitarian entrants do not have to pay an  application fee to migrate to Australia, are likely to be  reunited more quickly than those awaiting processing  through other migration channels and have immediate 

 access to social security benefits after arrival if they  need it.

 The Government has decided that these family  members will continue to migrate through the  Preferential Family category and will be counted as  part of the Humanitarian Program from 1 July 1996.

 However, in view of the Senate's disallowance of  proposed regulations, these families will still have to  pay the application fee and wait six months for access  to some social security benefits.

 These families will be given processing priority and will  have access to support services provided by the  Department of Immigration & Multicultural Affairs to all  humanitarian entrants.

 CAPPING LEVELS

 The Minister foreshadowed the likelihood that the  Government would place a cap on the number of  places for aged parents and spouses in the  Preferential Category during this program year. Aged  parents and spouses were currently exempt from  capping under the "cap and queue" process.

 If the Government was able to use the "cap and  queue" process being proposed in legislation currently  before Parliament, it was likely that those affected by

 such a cap would have only a few months to wait  before being granted a visa in the next program year.

 (The "cap and queue" process means that once the  numerical limit has been reached on a capped  category, applications can continue to be processed  and, once the visa grant stage is reached, are placed  in a queue to be granted in the following program year.

 This enables migration officers to give applicants an  indication of when they can expect to receive a visa if  they are in a capped class, allowing them to plan their  travel and other arrangements.)

 If the legislation is not passed and the Government  needed to use the existing "cap and terminate"  process instead, this would mean that once the cap or  limit on a certain category had been reached, no more  applications could be accepted in that financial year.

 The remaining applicants would have to be refunded  their application fees and would have to re-apply in the  new program year.

 *Definitions:

 Independent - for people who have skills that will  benefit Australia. Applicants must pass a points test to  be eligible.

 Concessional Family - for non-dependent children,  parents of working age who do not meet the balance of  family test, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews.  Applicants must pass a points test to be eligible and be 

 sponsored by a relative in Australia.

 Regional Family - a sub-class of the Concessional  Family category intended to encourage people already  living in specific designated areas to sponsor skilled  family migrants to join them, subject to a range of  criteria. There is no points test.

 Preferential Family - for close family members,  including spouse, fiancb, de facto, interdependent,  aged parent and dependent or adopted child. There is  no points test for applicants in this category, but 

 applicants must be sponsored.

 "Immediate family members" of Humanitarian Program  entrants are proposed for entry to Australia by the  family member already in Australia. It includes the  spouse and dependent children of the proposer.  Parents are included only when the proposer is a  minor. The family relationship must have existed at the  time the proposer was granted a visa under the 

 Humanitarian Program, or if the proposer is a  Protection Visa holder, at the time the proposer applied  for that visa, and the relationship is ongoing.

 Prepared by the Public Affairs Section of the  Department of Immigration & Multicultural Affairs  on 13 December 1996.
