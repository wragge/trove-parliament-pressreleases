  News Release

  LAURIE BRERETON MP 

  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

  

 11 June 1999

 61/99

  KOSOVO

  

  The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today welcomed 
the suspension of NATO’s air offensive against the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia.

  

 “The news that Yugoslav military and security forces 
are withdrawing from Kosovo and that NATO has suspended its air-strikes 
will be warmly welcomed by all Australians”, Mr Brereton said.

  

 “No one should underestimate the violence and atrocities 
which have taken place in Kosovo. Yugoslav troops and Serbian police 
shelled villages, committed massacres, and killed thousands of Kosovar 
Albanians in the course of the past year. The reports of atrocities 
in Kosovo have led to the indictment for war crimes of President Milosevic 
and four other Yugoslav leaders by the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the Former Yugoslavia. According to the latest information from 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 780,000 
people have been forced to flee from Kosovo.”

  

 “The imminent deployment of a NATO-led peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo gives real hope that the many thousands of displaced 
Kosovar Albanians will be able to eventually return to their homes. 
Clearly, however, there is still an enormous humanitarian crisis and 
a need for a very substantial international aid effort to help the Kosovar 
people rebuild their shattered lives and communities.”

  

 “The cessation of hostilities should be used by 
the Australian Government to make renewed efforts to secure the release 
of the Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, the two CARE Australia workers 
who have been so unjustly convicted and imprisoned by the Yugoslav authorities 
for alleged espionage. No stone must be left unturned in further efforts 
to secure freedom for Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. They must not languish 
in prison to be used by President Milosevic as political bargaining 
chips against international efforts to make his regime accountable for 
its actions."

  

 “In Australia, the cessation of hostilities should 
also bring a measure of relief to the Albanian and Serbian communities 
which have been deeply affected by the Kosovo conflict. All sides of 
Australian politics must make a concerted effort to heal divisions and 
affirm the place of both communities as integral and valued elements 
of our tolerant multicultural society.”
