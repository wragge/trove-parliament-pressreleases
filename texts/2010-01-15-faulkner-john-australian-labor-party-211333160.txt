 CYBER SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTRE OPENING   

 Russell Offices, Canberra  11:00am, 15 January 2010 

 

 Check against delivery   

 Senator John Faulkner, Minister For Defence   

 Good morning and welcome. Firstly let me begin by acknowledging the  traditional owners of this land, and paying my respects to their elders past and  present.   

 It is my pleasure to be here today to open the new Cyber Security Operations  Centre, and to welcome distinguished guests:   

 â¢ His Excellency Mr Jeffrey Bleich, United States Ambassador,   â¢ His Excellency Mr Michael Leir, Canadian High Commissioner and   â¢ His Excellency Dr John Larkindale, New Zealand High Commissioner.    

 I also welcome senior officials:   

 â¢ Mr Duncan Lewis, National Security Adviser;  â¢ Mr David Irvine, Director-General of the Australian Security  Intelligence Organisation;  â¢ Australian Police Commissioner Tony Negus;  â¢ Dr Ian Watt, Secretary of Defence; and   â¢ Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Chief of the Defence Force.   

 I’d also like to extend a welcome to the media. I’m delighted to be associated  with the first occasion on which the media has been brought into the Defence  Signals Directorate Headquarters in Canberra.   

 The opening of the Cyber Security Operations Centre today is a very  significant element of the Government’s response to cyber threats. Since  2007 this Government has acted quickly in identifying cyber security as a top  national security priority. The overall Australian Government Cyber Security  Strategy was released by the Attorney General in November last year.   

 It is a top priority because Australia is increasingly dependent on information  and communications technology (ICT). ICT underpins almost every function of  government at all levels - federal, state and local - from our national  infrastructure to transport services, health, education and emergency  services.   

 And according to the Bureau of Statistics, 72% of Australian households have  home internet access compared with 16% ten years ago. This is not  surprising. The Internet is now a fundamental part of life.  The internet and its  associated technologies are entrenched in all aspects of Australian life.  Businesses, private citizens, our government, our economy - all are heavily  reliant on computer systems and the Internet.    

 And information and communications technology offers great benefits. The  internet brings us flexibility and efficiency and blurs international borders,  bringing the world into our homes. As individuals, we can bank, shop, chat 

 with friends, schedule events, in fact do most of our day-to-day activities on-line. For the generation now entering the workforce, this convenience is so  routine that losing it is inconceivable. Businesses take advantage of the same 

 kind of convenience, and add remote work practices, sophisticated  teleconferencing, rapid information transfer and easy international  communication, and much more.     

 Like all technologies, there is a dark side. Any technology can be turned to  serve malicious purposes - and the more pervasive and accessible a  technology is, the more easily it can be abused.   

 Our appreciation of the threat modern technology can pose is often couched  in terms of the ease with which it can be subverted by those who wish us,  wish Australia, harm. But the internet is not only a tool in this battle - 

 cyberspace is a battlefield itself.    

 Cyber intrusions on government, critical infrastructure and other information  networks are a real threat to Australia’s national security and national  interests.     

 The establishment of this Cyber Security Operations Centre within the  Defence Signals Directorate is a significant step in meeting the Government’s  2009 Defence White Paper commitment to provide comprehensive  understanding of the cyber threat.    

 The Cyber Security Operations Centre will serve Defence needs, but this is  not just about Defence. The Centre is a key part of the Government’s national  cyber security initiative.  Two other components were announced in the 2009-10 Budget. These were:    

 â¢ the creation of the new national computer emergency response team,  CERT Australia, and  â¢ a study on the number of Australian Government Internet Gateways,  which is currently underway. 

 

 These initiatives are complementary. They harness expertise from across  government and the community.    

 Ladies and gentlemen, the internet is, by definition, about linkages and  sharing. And because the problems in cyber space are shared, the response  to them must also be shared across government and the community.    

 The new Cyber Security Operations Centre, while located here in the Defence  Signals Directorate, includes representatives from a number of government  organisations.    

 These include the Attorney-General’s Department, the Australian Security  Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Federal Police.    

 Each government agency represented in the Centre brings different expertise  to respond to critical incidents. Each has responsibility for delivery of particular  cyber security outcomes.   

 CERT Australia, the new national computer emergency response team, is, as  announced by the Attorney-General in November last year, coordinated by the  Attorney-General’s Department as the lead government agency for cyber  security policy across the Australian community.    

 CERT Australia and the Cyber Security Operations Centre are two mutually  supporting organisations. CERT Australia will be the national coordination  point within government for providing cyber security information and advice for  the Australian community and private sector. It will educate all Australians and  provide the information and tools needed to protect themselves on line.    

 The Cyber Security Operations Centre will provide critical understanding of  the threat from sophisticated cyber attack. The Centre is at the forefront of  developing capabilities to gain an edge in the cyber space domain. The new 

 Centre will work collaboratively with CERT Australia to respond to cyber  security incidents.    

 The Cyber Security Operations Centre will play a fundamental role in  discovering and responding to sophisticated cyber threats to networks of  national significance.   

 The Cyber Security Operations Centre is staffed by highly-skilled information  technology experts, engineers, and analysts drawn from the Defence Signals  Directorate, the Defence Intelligence Organisation, and the Australian 

 Defence Force. There will also be scientists from the Defence Science and  Technology Organisation and, as I mentioned earlier, representatives from the  Attorney-General’s Department, the Australian Security Intelligence  Organisation, and the Australian Federal Police.    

 The existing workforce brought into the Cyber Security Operations Centre  from the Defence Signals Directorate stands at 51 and will grow to about 130  over the next five years.   

 The Defence Signals Directorate is the right place for this Centre. Apart from  the highly talented people who work here, the Directorate has powerful  technologies required to advance cyber security. 

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, the cyber threat comes from a whole range of sources,  sources with skills and sophistication at a wide range of levels. They include  individuals working alone; issue-motivated groups; organised criminal  syndicates, as well as state-based adversaries. But the very nature of the  Internet makes it difficult to precisely attribute the source of individual cyber  incidents. It is easy for those who seek to compromise, destroy or steal  electronic information to hide in cyber space and remain anonymous.    

 Already we have evidence of sophisticated cyber intrusions onto networks in  Australia, both government and private. Not all are successful, but some have  been - on a range of networks.  We must meet the challenge of detecting and  stopping threats in the ever-changing, ever-adapting world of cyberspace.    

 Ladies and gentlemen, most people think of the Defence Signals Directorate  as a foreign signals intelligence collection agency. The Directorate plays a  critical role in supporting the Australian Defence Force and combating  terrorism, international crime and weapons proliferation. The Directorate has  achieved some real success which necessarily goes publicly unrecognised  but which I acknowledge here today.   

 What is less known is that the Defence Signals Directorate has another  important role as the Commonwealth national authority on information  security. It provides government with protective security advice and  assistance. The Cyber Security Operations Centre fits naturally with this role.  The Centre will also have at its disposal the Defence Signals Directorate’s  high powered computing resources and advanced analytic techniques, which  will enable it to process large quantities of data.    

 Ladies and gentlemen, the successful establishment of any new capability  such as this one is always due to the efforts of many people, and many  organisations. The speed with which the Defence Signals Directorate, and  associated agencies, have established the Centre we are opening today  shows the depth of commitment to this initiative.   

 I know there have been some long hours for some of you. Let me assure you,  on behalf of the government, that your efforts are appreciated. And I know  that, unavoidably, there will be some long hours ahead, too.  Cyberspace is a  24 hour a day world, one in which old assumptions about geographic  boundaries and time zones are obsolete. This is one of the great benefits of  modern technology - cyberspace is always open for business. But this also  brings great challenges to those who guard our electronic borders.     

 I have every confidence, ladies and gentlemen, that the new Cyber Security  Operations Centre and its staff are equal, more than equal, to the task.     

 It is with great pleasure that I now officially open the Cyber Security  Operations Centre.

 OPENING OF CYBER SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTRE   

 E&OE   

 SENATOR FAULKNER, MINISTER FOR DEFENCE    

 QUESTION:    

 You say that 72% of Australians have the Internet at home, will these  resources be deployed to sift through the emails and the communications and  the digital phone calls of everyday Australians?   

 SENATOR FAULKNER:    No, look, this centre is - has been established to protect Australian networks  of national importance from sophisticated cyber attack. The centre will advise  on how best to safeguard Australian critical infrastructure in the government  and private sector from cyber threat. I mentioned a little earlier, of course, the  role of CERT Australia, there are, of course, opportunities if there are  concerns from companies or individuals who if they - if they are concerned or  perhaps even become aware of the fact that they have been attacked or feel  they might be a victim of cyber crime, in the first instance what I would  suggest those people should do obviously is contact their service provider  which is something that service providers, I think, recommend their customers  do. It's also possible, of course, and we should acknowledge this, that this  kind of activity might - may also be a criminal offence and if that's the case  then it should appropriately be reported to a State or Territory police service.  But CERT Australia will be the national coordination point for providing  security information and advice to the Australian community and the private  sector who have these sorts of concerns.   

 QUESTION:    

 Minister, can you give us any idea of the scale of the attacks on government  systems or private company systems at the moment?   

 SENATOR FAULKNER:    I can give you some information on that. I can say to you that in calendar year  2009 that Defence investigated approximately 200 electronic security  incidents on its own networks per month. I can also say to you though that  Defence effectively responded to these activities and I can say that no  operations to date were disrupted due to network intrusion activities. DSD, as  I said before, has a broader role. It does provide advice and assistance to  both federal and State authorities and the last information that I had received 

 is that it had - that DSD had - it received a little over 200, I think, around 220  reported incidents and tip-offs relating to the Australian Government in  calendar year 2009 as well. And I think I perhaps should conclude my answer 

 by strongly reinforcing the point with you, of course, that appropriate  measures are taken to protect the networks when this occurs and of course,  as you would expect, appropriately again the right people are informed. 

 

 QUESTION:    

 Minister, given the advent in growth of cyber crime and cyber war and other  forms of hacking, is it fair to say that Australia is now at war every day of the  year?   

 SENATOR FAULKNER:    Well I wouldn't use that terminology. I think that what it is fair to say is that you  saw in the Defence White Paper the significance and importance that the  Government placed on dealing with mitigating the cyber threat to our national 

 security and this centre is very much about that, about providing Defence with  a cyber capability and providing a resource designed to serve all government  agencies and I reinforce, I suppose, with you the main roles that I mentioned a  little earlier today of the Cyber Security Operations Centre and I might  mention as an aside, you will all be pleased to know that I haven't yet but I  now will use the new official Defence acronym which is CSOC for the centre.  But the centre - yeah, I knew you would be very comfortable to realise it has  an acronym - but the centre does have these critical roles of providing  government with a comprehensive understanding of cyber threats against  Australian interests and coordinating and assisting operational responses to  cyber events of national importance across government and critical  infrastructure. My own approach on these things is not to use hyperbole. I'm  trying to present what I believe is factual and balanced outline to you of the  nature of the challenges we face here in Australia and why the Cyber Security  Operations Centre and its role and function is so important.   

 QUESTION:    

 Minister, is it fair to say that a lot of these attacks come from China and can I  also ask whether or not this facility has the ability to launch cyber attacks as  well as detect them?   

 SENATOR FAULKNER:    In relation to the first part of your question, it is true that the global community  continues to experience an increase in cyber intrusions. We need to  understand, I think, that all systems that are connected to the Internet are  potential targets for hacking or cyber attack. There has been speculation, as  late as some media commentary today, there has been speculation about  nation states mounting cyber attacks, there's been also, as you're aware,  speculation about nation states mounting cyber attacks against Australian  Government information networks. There is some evidence that electronic  intrusion of Australian Government sites has been conducted from overseas  but I stress that the nature of the Internet makes it difficult, perhaps  impossible, to attribute those attacks to exact sources and this comes back to  again the importance and significance of the establishment of this centre. With 

 the establishment of the centre and with the other government initiatives that  I've mentioned and outlined today, or touched on today, I think that we will be  able to have a much better understanding, I'm very confident we'll have a  much better understanding of the nature of the risk in the future and not only  the nature of the risk in the future but how we might counter it. But I want to 

 say this, having made those points to you, I am certainly not going to  comment on specific instances of exploitation of government networks, I  won't, I won't do that because I certainly will never do anything that might  have the consequence, unintended or otherwise, of compromising our ability  to defend Australia from hacking or attack. And as to the other part of your  question, which went to I think the role that Australia might play in terms of I  think you were suggesting or asking about whether Australia engages in this  sort of activity, again what I said a moment ago I think does and must apply in  relation to these sorts of questions. As I mentioned before I took questions at  this press conference, I am not prepared to address the issue of Defence's  cyber activities or capabilities, go into any detail about that, it's not appropriate  to do so. I will not do that and you should make no other judgment in relation  to this other than the fact that it would be inappropriate for me or anyone else  to do that because I will not be placed in a position in any way, shape or form  where I would jeopardise Australia's national security.   

 QUESTION:    

 Minister, this is about these events about the Government's purported interest  in transparency and accountability of its operations.  In the interests of  transparency and accountability, why shouldn't the Government or why  shouldn't ASIO make public or make known to asylum seekers, refugees and  the Minister for Immigration the reasons why somebody's security - somebody  is deemed to be a security risk?   

 SENATOR FAULKNER:    Well, you know, Alex, there was a time when I was the minister who was  responsible for government accountability and transparency and now I'm the  Minister for Defence and now here you are asking me this question in DSD  and for the first time with journalists with us but I'm going to - as you would  expect me to do, and as I always do, politely decline your generous offer to  talk about issues outside my portfolio. I've, as you know, got a very strong  record of not trampling into areas of responsibility of other ministers and it is,  of course, true that historically I've had a role in that regard and ministerial  responsibility for these sorts of issues but now I'm the Minister for Defence  and as I say, now here you are asking me a question about transparency for  the first time as a journalist within the bowels of DSD. 

 

 QUESTION:    

 Minister, you said earlier that there have been some successful intrusions. Are  you able to give us an example of the scale of these attacks and whether it's  to do with, you know, networks or sensitive information?   

 SENATOR  FAULKNER:    Well, I think in answer to the earlier question I actually did give an indication of  the - of scale. I did say during the last calendar year Defence investigated - it's 

 around 200 electronic security incidents on its own networks per month. I think  that is a pretty clear indication of the scale but I also made the point, and I  want to - I want to reinforce that point that Defence did effectively respond to  those activities and I can say to you that no operations to date have been  disrupted due to network intrusion activities. I think that's a very clear 

 indication to you of the scale of this sort of activity and there's a lot of shuffling  feet now and maybe I'll just take one other question and then everyone can  have a cup of tea and a slice of cake and not have to listen to me any longer,  if there is another question.   

 QUESTION:    

 Minister, away from this but still with your portfolio, do you know if any  Defence personnel will be sent to Haiti to help in the recovery operations over  there?   

 SENATOR FAULKNER:    At this stage we have no plans to do so. You'd be aware that the Foreign  Minister announced Australia's immediate response in relation to the disaster  in Haiti yesterday. I'm expecting to be briefed at a later stage from my own  portfolio and also hear from other government agencies about what the  situation is. Thanks very much.
