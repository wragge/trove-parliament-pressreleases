 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 11 November 2014   

 Immigration detention oversight body must  report to Parliament: Greens   

 A new oversight body, set up to supervise the immigration network, should report directly to  Parliament, not just the Immigration Minister, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Independent scrutiny of these centres, which operate under a cloud of secrecy, has been needed  for some time,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “While I welcome the government’s announcement today, the devil will be in the detail when it  comes to how the group will operate in the long term.   

 “This group should be reporting to Parliament directly, not just the Minister, to ensure openness and  transparency.   

 “When the Abbott government came to power, they immediately scrapped the Independent Health  Advisory Group. That was a bad mistake and people have been exposed to harm as a result.   

 “While this is a step in the right direction, it’s not enough and it won’t make the camps of abuse and  cruelty on Manus and Nauru liveable. Like the UN has said, no child belongs in detention.   

 “Australia should be processing refugee claims in the region, before people are forced onto a boat,  and increasing our humanitarian intake. Only then will we be saving lives while genuinely caring for  refugees.”
