 DR PETER NYGH

 It was with much sadness that I received last night the news of the death of the Hon Dr Peter Nygh.

 Dr Nygh was a distinguished Australian who contributed to the nation in a number of significant fields of endeavour.

 His long career included terms as a judge of the Family Court of Australia, chairman of the Family Law Council, member of the Australian Law Reform Commission and principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 Dr Nygh was also a distinguished academic and one of Australia's foremost authorities on conflict of laws. He was a respected professor at the University of New South Wales, Bond University in Queensland, Macquarie University and the University of Sydney.

 In addition, Dr Nygh represented Australia in international forums and was a member of successive Australian delegations to the Hague Conference on Private International Law.

 Dr Nygh was held in the highest regard by his colleagues and friends and will be greatly missed.  Many in the international legal community will also mourn his death.

 On behalf of the Government, I extend my deepest sympathy to Dr Nyghâ€™s family and friends.
