  Media Release

  The Hon Duncan Kerr, MP

  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

  

  21 October 1999

  

  John Howard not doing enough 
to prevent drug smuggling, illegal fishing

  Shadow Customs Minister Duncan 
Kerr described as "inadequate" the Government's Border   Protection Legislation Bill, to be debated in the 
Parliament today.

  "While Labor supports the specific provisions 
of the Bill, we are critical of the Government's overall, ad hoc approach 
to border protection," said Mr Kerr.

  The Border Protection Legislation Bill is the Government's 
legislative response to recommendations 17 and 18 of the Prime Minister's 
Coastal Surveillance Task Force Report, which was released in June this 
year. This Task Force was set up to look at the problem of people smuggling.

  "The Bill was introduced following the Government 
investigation into the issue of illegal boat people. But this is just 
one of a myriad of threats to our coastline including drug smuggling 
and illegal fishing and pearling.

  "The Government must take a comprehensive and 
coordinated approach on this issue.

  "Australia has 11 million square kilometres 
of ocean to monitor. 

  "There is no one agency in Australia with overall 
responsibility for our maritime jurisdiction. Groups responsible for 
border protection include the Fisheries Management Authority, the Quarantine 
and Inspection Service, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs, the Australian Federal Police, Defence and Customs.

  "While the Bill recognises the need for Australia 
to be able to enforce our maritime laws, the Government does not have 
an adequate or a coordinated plan for coastal surveillance. 

  "Drug smuggling operations, traditionally concentrated 
around Torres Strait have now started to route vessels towards the south 
of our continent, taking advantage of the low level of maritime policing 
south of the line between Broome and Cairns. 

  "The southern fisheries around Heard Island 
and McDonald Islands also require urgent monitoring.

  "Labor believes that a better approach would 
be to examine the option of establishing an Australian Coastguard which 
could operate as a single agency with a whole of government approach.

  "An Australian Coastguard would reduce duplication 
of expenditure and operations.
