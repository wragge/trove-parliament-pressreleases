  John Bradford, MP

  Federal Member for Mcpherson

  House of Representatives

  

  OUR RESPONSIBILITY WITH NATIVE TITLE SHOULD

  BE TO ACT JUSTLY AND SHOW MERCY

  BUT HOWARD GOVERNMENT’S LEGISLATION

  DOES NOT, SAYS BRADFORD

  

  Federal Parliamentary Leader  of the Christian Democratic Party, 
Mr John Bradford MP, today said that it was dishonest of the Howard 
Government to claim that its Native Title Amendment legislation preserved 
the principles of native title established in the Mabo and Wik decisions.

  

 Mr Bradford said the Federal Government appears to 
justify its approach to Native Title as one that is consistent with 
some notion of equality which has a familiar and unfortunate ring to 
the debate.

  

 "We arc not talking about degrees of equality 
— we are talking about degrees of inequality and this legislation 
perpetuates inequalities,” Mr Bradford said.

  

 Mr Bradford said that it was unfortunate that due 
to time restrictions imposed by the Federal Government, many Members 
of the House of Representatives, including himself, were not able to 
speak in Parliament today when the “amended” Native Title Amendment 
Bill 1997 was re-presented.

  

 “Australia is a great nation, a mighty nation but 
its future continues to be undermined. There is only one people who 
in truly historical terms are indigenous. It is a terrible insult to 
suggest otherwise,” Mr Bradford said.

  

 “The rest of us are boat people or descendants of 
boat people. Perhaps even our Aborigines could agree we should all be 
sent back to where we originally came from.

  

 “This Native Title legislation is not just and does 
not encapsulate the meaning of mercy — which is to be compassionate 
to victims of misfortune”.

  

 Mr Bradford said that once again there is a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the real challenge facing Australia as a nation, 
which he said was the urgent challenge for reconciliation.

  

 This Native Title Amendment legislation remains adverse 
to that challenge. It continues to defy the spirit of Mabo and Wik. 
It continues to add insult to injury for our Indigenous Australians,” 
Mr Bradford said.

  

  

 While Mr Bradford said he supported the efforts of 
Senator Brian Harradine to resolve the Native Title issue and provide 
certainty, predictability and security for the mining industry and farmers, 
the process of reconciliation with Australian Aborigines has been put 
back 210 years.

  

 “This legislation now represents a washing of the 
hands by this Parliament of the key issue. It passes over the ultimate 
responsibility to some State Governments who have shown clearly by their 
rhetoric that the politics of the issue far outweighs any principle,” 
Mr Bradford said.

  

 “Again like many things in our society it comes 
down to money. The right to negotiate becomes a tentative right to compensation. 
The opportunity to achieve co-existence is lost. The opportunity for 
Indigenous Australians to break free of the welfare shackles we have 
imposed upon them is lost.

  

 “What we have now is the prospect of more division, 
less certainty and no justice for our Indigenous Australians.”

  

 Mr Bradford said he deplores the fact that they (Indigenous 
Australians) were not even consulted in the past few weeks.

  

 “It was not as if there had been adequate consultation 
in the first place, at least not on their terms,” Mr Bradford said.

  

 “As church leaders have said, this process of negotiation 
has been flawed by the exclusion of indigenous leaders. How could the 
people with so much at stake, with so much to lose be excluded?

  

  “The symbolism of this is almost unbelievable.

  

  “This is an act of betrayal b y this Parliament. It plays 
further into the hands of those who share the One Nation Party’s view 
of the world.”
