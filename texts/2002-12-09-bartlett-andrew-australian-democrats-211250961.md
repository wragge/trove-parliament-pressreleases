 Rural Australians for Refugees “Criticism of Carmen is just shooting the messenger”

 Principles of humanity have sunk without a trace under Coalition and ALP Refugee policies, Senator Andrew Bartlett, Leader of the Australian Democrats, told the Rural Australians for Refugees conference in Mudgee today.

 “The ALP’s new refugee and asylum seeker policy is a case of three steps back and one step forward,” he said.

 “Carmen Lawrence’s principled resignation is a clear sign that the ALP refugee policy is fundamentally flawed. Criticism of Carmen is just shooting the messenger. The Democrats would be quite happy to offer Dr Lawrence asylum from the increasingly conservative ALP.

 “The Pacific Solution, which Labor misleadingly claims to have scrapped, is built on ‘deter, detect and deny’.

 “We don’t need a refugee policy based on deter, detect and deny as the Government has done.

 “At the other extreme of the scale, we don’t need facile policies that allow everyone immediate, unfettered access to Australia, as the Green Party has proposed. We need commonsense and workable solutions.

 “Three crucial things must be done: end the Pacific Solution, its excise zone, and its massive expenses; abolish temporary protection visas; and scrap mandatory detention and the Christmas Island Detention Centre.

 “In regard to the ALP’s ‘Green Card’ proposal, the Democrats have always argued that refugees and asylum seekers do not come to Australia to steal our jobs. They come to save their lives.

 “On mandatory detention the ALP have heralded a different approach, releasing children, women and unaccompanied minors. The Government is progressively doing this, after years of Democrats advocacy.

 “The Democrats welcomed the fact in the ALP Policy that refugees on temporary protection visas will have the option of eventually applying for permanent residency and family reunion. None the less, the Australian Democrats believe temporary protection visas are anti-family and counter-productive and should be abolished.

 “Labor has said regions who want refugees will be resourced, but Labor will only increase the intake of refugees to Australia if they settle in regional areas. We already know the regions are not being given enough infrastructure and other services. You simply cannot force people into areas they don’t want to live in without providing services.

 “Removing the 45-day rule and ensuring that asylum seekers retained or gained work rights would go a hell of a long way to assisting people survive in the community and relieving the burden on charities, churches and the Red Cross. Unfortunately, Labor does not address this issue.

 “Australia is an island country and does not have the massive amounts of asylum seekers European countries are struggling with. We can and should adopt a framework that assesses claims fairly and quickly and ensures protection for those who need it,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
