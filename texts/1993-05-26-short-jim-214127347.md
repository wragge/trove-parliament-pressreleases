 1993/94 Migration Program Ignores Australia’s Needs

 The Government's proposed non-humanitarian migration program for 1993/94 appears  largely to ignore Australia's current economic circumstances, and runs contrary to  Minister Bolkus' rhetoric in his announcement.

 The only real cut in the proposed 1993/94 intake has come with the 5,000 reduction in  the Preferential Family, or "immediate family", Category.

 In reducing the planned overall intake by 5,000 compared to the 1992/93 intake, the  Minister claims that the program "reflects widespread agreement that the current level  of migration is appropriate for our current social and economic conditions." However,  the composition of the intake indicates that the Government has paid little or no regard 

 to the continuing depressed state of the economy and the one million Australians already  in the Government's dole queues.

 Whilst the Minister claims to be reducing places in the skilled migration category by  5,000, he is at the same time increasing the Concessional Family Category by a  corresponding number. Many experts argue that the Concessional Family Category is  simply another form of skilled migration. This view is supported by the fact that a skills  points test applies to this category. In other words, the Government has made virtually  no change in the skilled migration intake number. This number should have been

 Nor does the Government appear to have taken any account of the calls by the Coalition  and others to target the skilled migration intake to those areas of skills in short supply  in Australia. Its failure to do this means that the Government will again raise the  employment hopes of aspiring migrants only to see them dashed when they arrive to find 

 unemployment so rife and the dole after six months the only "opportunity" Australia can  offer.

 The Coalition welcomes the planned increase of 1,000 in Australia's intake of refugees  in the coming year. Australia has an obligation to play a significant role in providing  humanitarian resettlement at a time when the refugee problem has escalated as a result  of conflicts around the globe. The Minister should provide additional information at an 

 early date on the expected geographic breakdown of the total figure of 13,000.

 Today's announcement makes no mention of the Government's proposed handling of the  17,000 pre-Tiananmen Square Chinese students in Australia and their 9,000 dependents.  These 26,000 people have a four year "special category of temporary resident permit",  granted by then Prime Minister Hawke, which expires on 30 June 1994. The Government 

 has to date done no pre-processing of these people in advance of June 1994.

 The Minister should have made an announcement about the future treatment of these  Chinese students and their dependents in today's statement. I call on him to do so as a  matter of urgency.

 In his first attempt to address Australia's needs in immigration, Senator Bolkus has  clearly failed.
