 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats Immigration Spokesperson

 20 March 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/129

 More Refugee Legislation to be rushed through the Senate The Australian Democrats have expressed outrage that major refugee legislation is once again going to be rushed through the Senate by the Government with the support of the Labor Party.

 The Migration (Transitional Movement) Bill will introduce yet another processing system for asylum seekers by enabling the Government to bring asylum seekers into Australia whilst preventing them from being able to apply for any visa or having access to our legal system.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett has attacked the Labor Party for once again allowing major refugee legislation to be rushed through Parliament without any real scrutiny.

 “The Bill was only introduced into Parliament last Wednesday and Liberal and Labor are trying to force it through the Senate by tomorrow,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Clearly, Labor has learnt nothing since it sided with the Liberals to rush through major refugee Bills just before the last election.

 “It is disgraceful that the Labor Party is still willing to assist the Government and flout international law by further entrenching the removal of human and legal rights from those seeking asylum and further undermining the integrity of the Refugee Convention.

 “The Coalition and the ALP have already combined to try have a sham investigation of the Bill through Senate Committee and have frustrated the Democrats’ attempts to have any serious examination of this Bill.

 “This legislation is unprecedented under international law,” Senator Andrew Bartlett said. “It effectively imports the Pacific solution onshore and excises asylum seekers from our migration zone for the arbitrary period of six months or more.

 Senator Bartlett said he could not understand the reason for the indecent haste used to pass the bill. “We are deeply suspicious of the real intentions behind this legislation. It appears to be a ploy to pre-empt the upcoming Senate Committee examination into the Pacific Solution.

 “The Democrats have ensured that this committee will examine the implications of the Pacific solution and expose the problems associated with this process. By allowing further legislation to go through Parliament, which suspends legal rights of asylum seekers, both the Government and Opposition are in danger of further complicating and modifying the Pacific Solution with no real knowledge of the consequences.

 “They are yet to examine the system already operating, but see no problem with asking the Senate to fast-track debate on the bill despite the fact that very significant amendments are still being finalised.”
