 Media release: Fairfield a great fit for unique team

 20 February 2014

 Senator the Hon Marise Payne

 Minister for Human Services

 Minister for Human Services Senator the Hon Marise Payne today paid 

 tribute to staff at the Fairfield Service Centre for the important work they 

 perform assisting refugees.

 With one of the most culturally diverse communities in the country, Fairfield 

 is one of only five sites around Australia to host the highly specialised 

 refugee servicing team. Minister Payne praised staff at the Fairfield Service 

 Centre for their work in providing support to new arrivals.

 "Most refugees arrive in Australia without money, assets or a support 

 network of family and friends, so the Refugee Servicing team plays a vital 

 role in helping new arrivals transition into their adopted community," 

 Minister Payne said.

 "The team provides a face-to-face service to refugees on arrival and advises 

 them on the range of Commonwealth assistance they may be entitled to 

 depending on their personal circumstances.

 "Access to helpful information through a specialised team such as the group 

 based here in Fairfield is critical for these new arrivals."

 Minister Payne said it was very appropriate that the dedicated team of staff 

 was based in the Fairfield region.

 "Fairfield holds a unique place as one of Australia's most culturally diverse 

 communities with around 73 per cent of the local population from various 

 cultural and linguistic backgrounds," Minister Payne said.

 "Settlement patterns of refugees are highest in locations of low cost rental 

 accommodation that are close to public transport and accessible to familiar 

 foods, community and religious support.

 "Therefore, arrival patterns tend to be concentrated in the outer suburbs of 

 the largest cities.

 "Fairfield Local Government Area has the largest number of refugee arrivals 

 after Dandenong in Victoria."
