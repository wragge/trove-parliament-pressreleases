 MINISTER FOR DEFENCE TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PETER REITH MP

 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW ­ BRISBANE

 REITH:

 Our thoughts are obviously with the American and UK personnel who were involved in the action overnight. I got a phone call from the Chief of the Defence Force just after 1am who advised me of the impending air strikes and actions in the Middle East. I got on the phone and spoke to the Prime Minister who just spoke to the White House. Obviously there are no Australians in this first stage of the campaign. Needless to say also that our expectation is that there will be various elements of the campaign over a period of time [inaudible]..and Australia stands ready to provide assistance [inaudible]….

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 We have a range of capabilities. We have specified our general expectations in regards to the SAS and in regards to air-to-air refuellers. In addition we have available maritime surveillance aircraft. We have already a ship in the Persian Gulf which has relieved other assets to participate in the current actions. We have given and are giving consideration to the provision of an amphibious command ship which would have [inaudible]…….

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Well, we have made troops, those specialist elite troops available. Obviously deployment is subject to further discussions and may also subject to the circumstances be subject to operational security.

 JOURNALIST:

 Can you give us any indication of when it’s likely to occur?

  

 REITH:

 No, I am not in a position to talk about timing but to put it in context, what we have seen overnight is but the start of a campaign which will have various elements in it, that is our understanding of the general

 approach to be taken. As to the definition of an Australian involvement that’s still ahead of us. But one should not expect a necessarily a short sharp military campaign, we have reason to expect that this will be a longer process than that.

 JOURNALIST:

 What sort of updates is Australia getting on progress [inaudible]…

 REITH:

 Well, our people are obviously in close contact with various American military authorities. It was very sensible and timely for us to have had Admiral Chris Barrie in the United States talking with, at the highest levels of the American military and obviously we do have very good close contacts with them on an ongoing basis.

 JOURNALIST:

 Has security been tightened here at home either at the embassies or around the political leaders?

 REITH:

 Well, the Government obviously, as the Prime Minister said, there has been beefing up of security generally. We announced only a week ago [inaudible]…the doubling of our counter terrorism capacity as well as the re-establishment of an incident response unit. These measures are precautionary at this point in time but we think it is, and whilst there is no immediate concern or threat and we don’t want people to exaggerate or be overly concerned about the threat assessment in Australia it is at the same time sensible to be as ready as we possibly can for any contingency.

 JOURNALIST:

 Since the strikes this morning has there been any change?

 REITH:

 Well, in terms of some of the security arrangements some of those are public knowledge, some are better maintained under operational security.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]….

 REITH:

 Australia was involved from the very moment that Australians died in New York and we are very much apart of and involved in the campaign under way, not just with the ship but without going into any details on the intelligence side Australia is very involved.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 I think the world would run a very serious risk if it was not prepared to unite against terrorism and we take the strong stand that we do because we think the fundamental values which underpin this society are at risk if the acts of terrorism are not met head on and confronted and dealt with. And, yes, that obviously puts Australia in a higher international profile because we are very committed to being a constructive member of the Coalition but we believe that has very strong public support for the simple reason that most Australians appreciate that you have got to stand up to these people and…

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Oh well, these are very fundamental values which go to the nature of Australian society and that is why Australians have so resoundingly supported Australian participation in the Coalition.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]…about the asylum seekers?

 REITH:

 The situation is that the boat which was heading towards Christmas Island is outside of Australian territorial waters. We have had ADF personnel on board to ensure that the safety of those persons on board is looked after and obviously there are negotiations going on and discussions about managing that situation.

 JOURNALIST:

 Has that progressed anywhere today?

 REITH:

 Well, I don’t have anything else to say about that at this point in time.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 We have, just to deal with the assumption in your question, we have maintained our capability to the north. It is true that we haven’t specified in the last week or so the number of ships and operational details and that’s for a very good reason, we don’t see any point in providing publicly details to people smugglers who are watching the situation in Australia very carefully.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Yes, we have all the capability that we need based on the best military advice that the Government has

 available to it.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]…of the strikes overnight?

 REITH:

 Well, I don’t have any comment to make on that at this point in time.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 The Australian military has various levels of readiness and for operational security [inaudible]..both this Government and previous governments have not referred to individual units or particular levels of readiness but as we made clear in the statement last week on the ability of Australian personnel to contribute, we have matters in hand to deal with any contribution that we might want to make.

 JOURNALIST:

 What about the issue of Indonesia, the concern there and the possibility of our aircraft being used to evacuate Australians.

 REITH:

 Well, obviously in respect of Indonesia as with other places around the world we monitor that very closely through Foreign Affairs but I don’t have any other comments to make on that either. Thank you very much.
