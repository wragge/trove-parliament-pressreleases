 A ustralia a s sists UN program  to  d eterm in e s ta tu s  o f L aotians in  T hailand

 Australia would contribute $80 000 in 1988 towards a UN program to  determine the status of Laotians in Thailand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs  and Trade, Mr Bill Hayden, M.P., announced today.

 The program was set up by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) in 1985 to screen out genuine refugees from the large num ber of  Laotians seeking asylum in Thailand. It is estimated that up to 320 000  Laotians have crossed the border into Thailand since 1975 with the present  population about 85 000.

 Mr Hayden said that the screening procedures have helped to reduce the  flow of border crossers from Laos into Thailand.

 "The first group of nine 'screened out' Laotians returned to Laos in October  with a second group reported to have returned safely in December," Mr  Hayden said. .

 Australia's response to the determination of status of Laotians in Thailand  forms part of the Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
