 Litigation and Bridging Visas Pass Milestones MPS 048/2001 More than 40,000 people are extending their stay in Australia through the use of bridging visas and the growing incidence of litigation the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 "On current trends we are looking at an increase of about 20% this year in applications to the Courts and Administrative Appeals Tribunal," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Already in the first three quarters of this year, we have had 1,437 applications, compared with 1,589 in the whole of 1999-2000 and less than a thousand five years ago.

 "Immigration litigation has reached totally unacceptable levels with more than 1,000 active cases before the Courts and the AAT at the beginning of this month.

 "Including three "class actions" before the Courts, this year's applications could involve close to 30,000 people," Mr Ruddock added.

 "Litigation is allowing people to remain in Australia while they pursue cases which in the main, they will not win. The class actions give individuals the basis to delay departure at little personal expense.

 "The cost to my portfolio will be about $15-million, and that is before adding the costs of running the courts. My Department has had to write off more than $4.5-million in unrecoverable court costs in the past five years.

 "The Government has proposals before the Senate to limit litigation, especially class actions, but neither the Opposition nor the Democrats are willing to support those

 reasonable measures.

 "The litigation figures tell only part of the story, because I am concerned about the wider manipulation of the onshore application and review system by people wanting to prolong their stay in Australia to work," Mr Ruddock said.

 Most of the people involved in litigation would be on bridging visas, which are granted to allow people to remain in Australia lawfully while their litigation, refugee or immigration applications are decided. However, there are currently 40,000 people holding bridging visas.

 "While some have work rights, it is apparent many people on bridging visas are working illegally to support themselves while they remain here, taking jobs that belong to Australians," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Unless the Opposition or Democrats support Government action in the Senate to end abuse of the system, Australian taxpayers and workers will continue to be disadvantaged."
