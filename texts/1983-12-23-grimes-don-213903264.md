 Minister for  Social Security

 DJG 76/83 

 23 December 1983

 NEW GRANTS FOR 29 CHILDREN

 The Minister for Social Security, Senator Don Grimes, today announced  grants for 29 children's services projects under the Children's  Services Program.

 Senator Grimes said that the new grants demonstrated the Government's  continuing commitment to children's services evidenced by the allocation  of $10 million in the 1983/84 Budget for new and expanded projects. These grants bring the number of approvals for additional children's  services for 1983/84 to 96.

 Senator Grimes advised that the grants approved (details attached)  represented a full year cost of $1,195 million while expenditure  during 1983/84 was expected to be over $650,000.

 The Minister then provided details of some of the approvals "A number  of approvals are for grants to enable the employment of field staff  in high need metropolitan and country areas of NSW - field staff are  employed to investigate the need for children's services in specific 

 areas,  to evaluate the degree to which services are being met and to  provide support to newly established and existing services. The grants  are for a fixed period - usually 2 to 3 years. Tasks are developed  in negotiation with my Department specifically to redress the lack of 

 services in individual areas.

 "In recognition of the essential role that women's refuges provide  for women and children in need of emergency accommodation, a grant  of $72,000 has been approved for child care in four women refuges.  The grant provides for the salary of child care workers and for 

 ancillary costs including equipment. The refuges are at Penrith,  Katoomba, Moree and Nowra."

 Senator Grimes continued. "The Government's Children's Services  Program is also trying to assist people with children living in  caravan parks. Problems relating to life in caravan parks and the  detrimental effects on children are well documented. An increasing 

 number of people are now living in caravan parks because they are  unable to secure permanent housing or because of the nature of their  work. A grant has been approved to develop, as a pilot program in  Queensland, a mobile play unit to provide much needed service to both  mothers and children."

 Other grants announced by the Minister will provide for an additional  350 child places in family day care and centre based care and 150  places in occasional and outside school hours care.
