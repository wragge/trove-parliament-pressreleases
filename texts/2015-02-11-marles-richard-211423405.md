 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 STATEMENT    

 Labor welcomes todayâ€™s release of the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration  Detention report by the Australian Human Rights Commission. 

 We  support  every  effort  to  continue  the  work  that  began  under  Labor  in  moving   children and their families out of immigration detention and into the community. 

 The  best  thing  we  can  do  for  children  in  detention  is  to  have  refugee  claims   processed  quickly  so  nobody  has  to  languish  in  detention  with  no  hope  of   settlement. 

 Labor strongly believes where children are in the unavoidable situation of being in  immigration detention proper care must be on hand for their emotional and physical  wellbeing. 

 Labor  will  carefully  and  methodically  work  through  the  findings  and  

 recommendations contained in the report and respond appropriately.    

 Labor  thanks  Professor  Gillian  Triggs,  President  of  the  Australian  Human  Rights   Commission for her thoroughness and diligence in preparing this report.    

 It is vital we have transparency over our immigration system.
