 SPEECH 02-03-2005

 ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC

 GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

 ON THE OCCASION OF

 DINNER IN HONOUR OF HIS EXCELLENCY MOSHE KATSAV, PRESIDENT OF THE STATE  OF ISRAEL

 2 MARCH 2005

 Your Excellency, President Katsav and Mrs Katsav Senator the Honourable Paul Calvert, President of the Australian Senate, and Mrs Calvert The Honourable David Hawker, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Mrs Hawker Ambassador Tamir and Mrs Tamir Ambassador George Distinguished guests all

 President and Mrs Katsav, Marlena and I are delighted to welcome you to Government House. May I  extend to you, on behalf of the Australian government and people, our warmest greetings.

 Mr President, the truth of the old saying that ‘no road is long with good company’, underpins the historic  friendship between our nations, and the high regard Australians hold for the Jewish people.

 The foundation of our relationship as nations began almost sixty years ago when Australia voted in  support of UN Resolution 181 for the establishment of the Jewish State.

 One can but imagine the sense of optimism that seasoned the thoughts of the signatory nations as they  looked ahead with hope to the future prosperity and security of the Jewish people - with memories still  sharp from the horrors and injustices of World War Two.

 Mr President, in thinking of the State of Israel, one’s thoughts are inexorably drawn to the Jewish  Diaspora, with its origins in the fall of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile more than 2,500 years ago.  The lamentations by the waters of Babylon, ‘How could we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?’, echo  through centuries of Jewish migration, to communities in China, India, Ethiopia, throughout Western  Europe, later to the Americas, and ultimately here, in 1788, the year of the first European settlement in  Australia.

 And yet, as we know, unchosen emigration faced by the people of many nations  through the history of mankind, has not just been a chronicle of dispersal and  grief; it has also been an extraordinary account of contribution and adaptation.

 And no more so than the participation and achievement by the Jewish community in Australia. Indeed,  Your Excellency, only a little over four months ago, Marlena and I hosted a celebration here for the 60th 

 anniversary of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.

 I commented then on some of the community’s contributions over six decades, including:

 â¢         rehabilitating and resettling refugees from war in Europe;

 â¢         lobbying for the establishment of the State of Israel;

 â¢         taking a lead in the national dialogue of Christians, Muslims and Jews; 

 â¢         mentoring individuals, who have, as a result, risen to great heights in Australia’s social,  economic and cultural life; and

 â¢         supporting families through education, youth programs, and aged care.

 In particular I drew attention to rich and lasting contributions by great ‘Australian’ public figures from  the Jewish community, including:

 â¢         Lieutenant General Sir John Monash of World War One fame;

 â¢         Major General Paul Cullen, who commanded with distinction in World War Two in Papua New  Guinea;

 â¢         Sir Isaac Isaacs, our first Australian-born Governor-General;

 â¢         Former Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen;

 â¢         The Myer family (represented tonight by Mr & Mrs Baillieu Myer);

 â¢         Mr Justice Marcus Einfeld; and

 â¢         Mr Mark Leibler, whom I invested today as a Companion of the Order of Australia - for his  contributions to business, the law, and to the Jewish community.

 Mr President. At the government-to-government level, the strengthening of commercial interests between  Australia and Israel is seen in the increasing frequency of high-level contacts. Last year our Minister for  Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture visited Israel, along with trade delegations led by the  Premiers of the Australian States of Queensland and Victoria.

 The Israeli Health Minister has just recently visited Australia, and I understand that several other  ministers hope to visit here - and we trust that will happen before too long.

 In Australia, with its land mass of more than 7.6 million square kilometres, it would be difficult for many  Australians to comprehend how Israel, a state of just over 20,300 square kilometres, and almost 6.2  million people, has achieved so much in a handful of decades; a nation whose GDP is currently projected,  in 2005, to be US$120 billion.

 Israel has a technologically advanced market economy, and despite  limited natural resources, the country has intensively developed its  agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel enjoys 

 a high demand for its exports, and has proven itself innovative in  many areas including:

 â¢         Self-sufficiency in most horticultural and agricultural products;

 â¢         The development of high technology applications in aviation, communications, computer-aided  design and medical electronics; and in 

 â¢         Ongoing efforts to preserve water resources and to increase supply through de-salination  projects.

 Australia has similar interests and skills in high technology areas, and  there may well be opportunities for joint research in semi arid area  farming techniques, the environment, renewable energy research and  defence technologies. In terms of merchandise trade, Israel is  Australia's seventh most important export destination in the Middle  East and our 35th most important trading partner overall.

 Your Excellency, Israel has prospered as a home to its people despite significant, ongoing security issues.

 Australia has an absolute commitment to the security of Israel. Our nation supports Israel in its  determination to negotiate a just, enduring and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East for  the mutual benefit of all participants.

 None of us ignores the anxieties and complexities ahead - indeed Sir Isaiah Berlin termed it well, when he  spoke of “The Crooked Timber of Humanity”, describing the tortuous path of the history of mankind’s  thought and ideas.

 However, choices must be made.

 Australia strongly supports the Roadmap to Middle East peace as the way forward - to a Middle East  harnessing the talents of all its peoples and developing its resources for the common good, freed from the  long standing distrust and conflicts of the past.

 Australia applauds the determination of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority to find ways to achieve  peace for this and future generations.

 Every nation deserves to live in freedom and peace, to live in harmony with one’s neighbours; so that  people are able to prosper and to raise their families, in peace.

 Indeed we all hope, and pray, in our different ways and according to our different faiths, that lasting peace  can be achieved.

 Your Excellency, you are a superb incumbent of the high office of President of the State of Israel. In your 

 speeches, in your public duties, in drawing people together, you represent all that is good in the Office of  President and in the people of Israel whom you represent.

 The Book of Proverbs speaks of the ‘faithful envoy’ bringing health. In contemporary times, we witness  that in your visit to Australia; bringing goodwill and creating a bridge across cultures.

 Marlena and I wish you and Mrs Katsav a very happy, stimulating and blessed visit to our country. We  hope that you will always remember Australia and its people with affection, and we wish you and your  family peace and fulfilment during your term of office.

 Thank you.
