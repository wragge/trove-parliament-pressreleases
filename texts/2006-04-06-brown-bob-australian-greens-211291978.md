 Greens call for parliamentary debate on Kurdish group ban   

 6th Apr 06   

 The Greens will move in the Senate to disallow a government ban  on the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) Senator Brown announced  today. The government listed the PKK as a terrorist organisation in  December last year following the visit of the Turkish Prime Minister.    

 "Many Kurdish refugees in Australia are here because they were  persecuted by Turkey for being part of the PKK. Now the  government wants to turn them into criminals,‚Äù Senator Brown said.    

 "Mr Howard says that the Kurds in Iraq are an important part of the  new government, but cross the border and he calls them terrorists.  This is the worst double standard."    

 "We should be supporting moves for peace in the Kurdish areas of  Turkey. Instead the government has put trade ties with Turkey  ahead of human rights."    

 There has been limited opportunity for members of the Kurdish  community to contribute to the inquiry conducted by the Joint  Committee on Intelligence and Security which is due to hand down  its report next week.
