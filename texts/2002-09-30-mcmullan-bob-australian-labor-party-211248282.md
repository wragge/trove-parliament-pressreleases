  TRANSCRIPT  OF  MEDIA  DOORSTOP,  PARLIAMENT  HOUSE,  MONDAY 30 SEPTEMBER 2002  

  E & OE - PROOF ONLY  

  Subject: Budget outcome, Iraq war levy, ALP Special Conference, Kim Beazley  

  MCMULLAN: Today’s Final Budget Outcome figures show why the Government is so  desperate  to  put  on  an  array  of  taxes  and  charges  on  Australian  families.   They have lost control of the Budget.  They lost control of the Budget last year in their pre-election spending spree and they obviously haven’t been able to rein it in again.  The figures  today  are  a  damming  inditement  of  the  fiscal  management  of  Peter  Costello. They  show  that  he  is  not  focussing  any  longer  on  the  job  of  Treasurer  -  he  is  just marking  time,  waiting  to  be  Prime  Minister.   Australia  needs  a  Treasurer  who  has really got their mind on the job, who is trying to get the Budget under control and who doesn’t  turn  in  the  first  instance  to  new  taxes  to  solve  every  new  expenditure proposition and to cope with every problem as it arises in the Australian economy.

  JOURNALIST: But how disastrous is it, when the Government is confident that it can deliver cyclically balanced budgets?

  MCMULLAN: Well, the  laws of arithmetic are  pretty compelling.  If you want to have  balanced  budgets  over  the  cycle,  when  the  economy  is  growing  above  average levels you should be delivering a substantial surplus.  In May 2001 the Government expected  growth  to  be  about  3  per  cent  and  said  they  would  get  a  surplus.   It  now looks  like  growth  is  going  to  be  substantially  higher  for  that  financial  year  than  the Government forecast, and yet they still run a substantial deficit. They have blown the budget.  And no one budget is an economic crisis; what it is, is an indicator of lack of discipline  in economic management.  It is an indicator that the  Government has lost control of the Budget.

  JOURNALIST: But they’re still reducing debt though Mr McMullan, and that is the point of all of this isn’t it?

  MCMULLAN: Well, running up deficits is not the way to be balancing the Budget over  the  cycle  in  years  of  economic  growth.   This  is  the  time  when  you  should  be building up the surpluses that give you the capacity to cope when the economy slows. We are now faced with the circumstance where there is beginning to be some evidence that the economy might be slowing, and the Government not only has no capacity to respond to that, they are talking about putting up taxes, and that is exactly the wrong the policy response to the economic circumstances Australia faces, and it is forced on the Government by its profligacy last year.

  JOURNALIST: Will  Labor  introduce  new  taxes  if  there  is  a  war?  And  if  the Government does want to introduce a war levy, will you support it?

  MCMULLAN: Well, we have always said we will be a responsible Opposition, we will look at the proposition on its merit.  We will not leave Australia’s men and women of  the  armed  forces  short  of  support  even  if  they  are  committed  in  a  manner  with which we disagree.  It won’t be their fault if there is a commitment made with which we or the majority of Australians might disagree - that is a matter we will take up with the Government; but we won’t penalise the troops by failing to give them support.  But I still don’t believe we should need a special levy to fund the sorts of commitments the Government’s making.  We should neither need a special levy to fund assistance to the sugar industry nor should we need a special levy to fund a commitment to Iraq.

  JOURNALIST: But the Labor Government consistently ran Budget deficits and had  very  little  money  in  the  bank  during  the  1991/1992  recession  to  get  the economy through.  Isn’t it a bit hypocritical to be talking about this now?

  MCMULLAN: Well we’d actually run some substantial surpluses in the years leading  up  to  1991/1992.  But  the  agreed  policy  as  articulated  by  both  the Government  and  the  Opposition  is  that  we  should  balance  the  budget  over  the economic  cycle.  It’s  just  that  we  can  do  the  arithmetic  and  apparently  the Government can’t.  The  arithmetic of that means when you are  growing at above average  levels,  you  should  be  delivering  a  surplus  so  that  when  you  drop  below average, you have got the capacity to give a bit of stimulus.  The Government has failed against its own benchmark.

  JOURNALIST: On the Government’s own arithmetic a few years ago, we should be seeing rather large structural surpluses about now.  What happened to those?

  MCMULLAN: Well,  the  Government  was  forecasting,  as  you  would  recall,  in previous  years  that  the  surplus  for  the  years  around  now  would  be  about  $10 billion  to  $14  billion,  so  they  have  frittered  all  that  away.   Essentially  they  have spent  it  in  the  run  up  to  the  election.   In  the  12  months  in  the  lead  up  to  the election, the Government went on a spending spree, and they blew away all sense of budget management, of strict fiscal control.  They lost control of the Budget, and what  today’s  figures  show  is  that  they  haven’t  been  able  to  regain  control  of  the Budget.

  JOURNALIST: Is there a need for cuts now to cope with new spending demands like a war on terror or like a medical indemnity crisis or perhaps a war with Iraq?

  MCMULLAN: Well,  the  Government  needs  to  take  a  medium  term  view  to solving this problem.  You don’t leap in in day one.  But what we do want to know is,  what  is  the  state  of  the  Budget  for  2002/2003?   You  will  all  recall  that  the Commonwealth  brought  forward  the  mid-year  economic  forecast  to  October  last year because it suited their political agenda.  Well, I think it suits the Australian people this year for the Government to do it again, and I would like them to bring forward  the  mid-year  economic  forecast  to  October  again  so  we  do  get  an understanding  of  what  the  Budget  situation  looks  like  going  forward.   Today’s figures show us what it has just been like and it is a very worrying sign.  But what we want to know is what does it look like for the rest of this financial year? And they  should  bring  out  the  Mid  Year  Economic  and  Fiscal  Outlook  in  October,  as they did last year, to give us an insight.

  JOURNALIST: Just  returning  to  the  levy.   Why  would  you  not  suggest  to  the Government that they find areas to cut back in rather than penalise taxpayers?

  3

  MCMULLAN: Well,  that  is  an  option  for  the  Government  to  look  at.   We  will have a look at their propositions. There are certainly some areas of spending that we think are excessive. But at the moment, they have all the budget data; we don’t. We don’t know what the state of the budget is today.  We now know what it was up to  30  June.  We  don’t  know  what  this  year’s  Budget  looks  like  because  the Government  hasn’t  released  that  information.   When  we  get  it,  we  will  make comments  on  what  we  think  should  happen  going  forward.   We  are  not  in  a position to do that at the moment.

  JOURNALIST: Considering public opinion is still against military conflict with Iraq, how politically savvy would it be of the Government to introduce a war tax?

  MCMULLAN: Well, you have to make commitments on big issues like military commitments  on  what  you  believe  is  right  and  wrong,  not  what  you  believe  is popular.  But the key part of your question is, why do they need a tax to fund such a commitment?  I think they should make the commitment based on the principled position of what they think is right with regard to Iraq, then we need to talk about funding what we need to do.  But there should properly be no need to run a new tax to fund a military commitment in Iraq.  We have funded bigger commitments in the past without such special taxes. And calling it a levy is only a nice polite way of saying it is a new tax that is going to cost families $5 plus per week.

  JOURNALIST: Do  you  support, this is on  another issue  - do  you  support the debating of the ALP’s refugee policy, particularly, at this week’s conference?

  MCMULLAN: Well, I am fortunately not a delegate to this week’s conference so I am fairly relaxed about that.  The rules don’t seem to me to make that a very easy proposition.   The  conference  was  called  for  a  purpose.  But  it  should  basically,  I think,  discharge  that  purposes.   We  have  pretty  well-established  processes  for developing new policy. And if we were going to tell people in advance that we were going  to  debate  policy  issues  at  this  conference,  well  then  a  lot  of  people  would have  done  a lot of work developing policy options. But that normal notice  hasn’t been  given.  So  I  think  there  are  a  few  problems,  but  I  don’t  object  to  it  being debated if that is what the majority or the requisite majority of delegates think. It is not a problem to me.  But I think it has got a big task of getting the rules right. That  is  a  medium-term  task  that  is  very  important  for  the  Party  and  if  they  get distracted from that, then I think that would be a great pity.

  JOURNALIST: Do  you  think  they  might  distract  the  voters  of  Cunningham though, if asylum seekers does come up at this conference this weekend, right in time to be back on the agenda for the Cunningham by-election?  Is that a worry?

  MCMULLAN: No, I don’t think so.

  JOURNALIST: One  last  thing.   Kim  Beazley  said  on  the  weekend  that  he  is going to stick around indefinitely in politics.  Do you think that is the right thing?

  MCMULLAN: Well  indefinitely  is  a  very  brave  call  for  any  of  us.   But  he  is about the same age as me. I am encouraged that he thinks that is possible.  No, I think Kim has made a fantastic contribution here.  I hope he does stay.  Australia has undervalued the contribution of experienced parliamentarians.  It seems to be: you either you are in the executive arm of Government or Opposition or you are wasting your time.  Now I don’t have that view.  I think people like Kim, with his experience  and  his  knowledge  of  and  love  of  the  Parliament,  make  a  great

  contribution  to  public  debate  and  to  their  local  constituency,  just  as  good Members of Parliament. And if he chooses to stay I will be delighted - apart from the fact that he has got the office across the corridor from me and I enjoy having a cup of coffee with him.

  JOURNALIST: Could he replicate John Howard’s ‘Lazarus’ performance?

  MCMULLAN: Well,  Kim  is  a  person  of  outstanding  talent  but  he  knows  the political arithmetic.  The best prospect that the Labor Party has of getting back to government is with Simon Crean as the next Prime Minister and when I last spoke to Kim, that was exactly what he was working for and looking for.  But Kim, as a Member of Parliament, has got a tremendous contribution to make.  I regard him as a very good friend, and I hope that he continues to make it for so long as he feels able to make a positive contribution.  He has got a lot of ability, and I think the role of Member of Parliament would be enhanced by people like Kim playing it in the way that put many former Prime Ministers do in the House of Commons in the  UK.  Often  people  stay  on  for  years  after  they  finish  their  ministerial  careers and they make a very substantial contribution.
