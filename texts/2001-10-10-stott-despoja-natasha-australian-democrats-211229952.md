 Democrats target Tasmania Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, today committed the Democrats to winning back Tasmania and making education a key issue in the campaign for the State.

 In Hobart to launch the Party’s Tasmanian Senate and Lower House campaigns, including lead Senate candidate Debbie Butler, Senator Stott Despoja said the Democrats were serious about representing Tasmania and would campaign strongly to have the benefits of a strong tertiary education system recognised by the Federal Government and the Labor Party.

 “The University of Tasmania - widely acknowledged as one of the finest universities in Australia - is being stymied in its capacity to contribute to the social and economic prosperity of Tasmania,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 “Tasmania suffers a serious ‘brain drain’ because it does not get a fair go from the Commonwealth, receiving a lower number of funded places per capita than the mainland states.

 “Unfortunately, more than 500 of the State’s best and brightest young people leave Tasmania each year.

 “Tasmania has 2.42% of the 15-64 age cohort used as a basis for calculating participation rates, but only receives 2.18% of the funded places.  Tasmania could legitimately argue for almost 1,000 more funded places on this basis.  By comparison, Victoria gets 25.57% of Commonwealth funded places for 24.88% of the population.

 “The shortage of funded places means that 18.7% of Tasmanian students study interstate - a mobility rate twice that of the national average. Yet, only 25% of these are studying courses not offered by the University of Tasmania,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 “Tasmania desperately needs a balanced, strong voice in the Senate from a party with fresh, relevant ideas and practical solutions,” said Ms Butler.

 “We must create a better balance between environmental responsibilities, the needs of our urban and rural communities and economic management in Tasmania.

 “Decision makers must focus on public education, the preservation of our precious natural resources, reconciliation, refugees and the welfare of Tasmania’s people.”

 “With your support, the Australian Democrats and Debbie Butler can change politics in this State,” concluded Senator Stott Despoja.

 Senator Stott Despoja launched the Democrats’ Tasmanian campaign at 12.45pm today at the Democrats’ Campaign Office, Cnr Collins and Harrington Sts, Hobart. For further information contact Alison Rogers on 0419 867 649
