 $13.6 MILLION EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR HORN OF AFRICA

 The Australian Government will provide $13.6 million in emergency assistance to the Horn of Africa countries, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 Mr Kerin said the funding would be channelled through Australian non government organisations and international agencies in response to food shortages and health problems in the area caused by drought and civil war.

 "This affects more than 24 million people. About 11 million people Are affected in Ethiopia alone. Almost a million of these are refugees and returnees from Soma..ia and Sudan," he said.

 "Although the civil war has ended in Ethiopia, famine and continuing civil strife in some parts of the country mean that Ethiopia will need about 1.2 million tonnes of international food aid in 1992.

 "In Somalia, the lives of 4.7 million people are estimated to be at serious risk. Poor security has precluded major relief operations throughout most of the country. Somalian refugees continue to seek assistance in neighbouring Ethiopia and Kenya, placing additional pressure on limited relief supplies in those countries."

 The emergency package to Ethiopia (including Eritrea) will comprise $10.2 million in Australian food aid and $2.8 million in cash grants for the airlifting of relief goods, provision of medical supplies and programs dealing with health, immunisation, supplementary feeding and agricultural rehabilitation.
