 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 18.09.03   

 Senate supports mercy plea from Iranian refugees   

 Today the Senate supported a motion moved by The Greens calling on the Government to  end the forced deportation of Iranian asylum seekers, in light of evidence that returnees  continue to be at risk of imprisonment, torture, and death once back in Iran.   

 Senator Nettle also intends to table a letter to the senate she received from Iranian  detainees following a recent visit to the Villawood detention centre in Sydney.   

 "The Iranians I have met are in genuine fear of their lives, and no wonder considering the  continuing appalling human rights record of the Iranian regime." Senator Nettle said.   

 "At least four Iranians returned to Iran from Australia have been reported as missing with  one suspected of being killed.   

 "An asylum seeker returned from Turkey to Iran was arrested and executed, and yet the  Australian Government continues to keep secret its deal with the Iranian government  relating to the return of asylum seekers detained in Australia.   

 "These human beings are falling victim to the Coalition Government's agenda to be  'tough' on asylum seekers. The Greens will continue to oppose this cruel and inhumane  project and welcome the Senates support today."  

 

 Today's motion...  (a) notes that;   (i) there are currently over 250 Iranians in immigration detention in Australia.   (ii) the Government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  with the Iranian Government that creates a bilateral response to Iranian asylum seekers  that fail to be granted refugee status in Australia.    (iii) a number of these detainees were, in August 2003, offered $1000 to return  to Iran voluntarily, or face forced deportation.   (iv) Amnesty International has described ongoing concerns about Human  Rights abuses in Iran, including their recent report on Iran which states:     "Scores of political prisoners including prisoners of conscience were  arrested. Others continued to be held in prolonged detention without trial or were serving  prison sentences imposed after unfair trials. Some had no access to lawyers or family.  Freedom of expression and association continued to be restricted by the judiciary and  scores of student, journalists and intellectuals were detained. At least 113 people,  including long-term political prisoners were executed, frequently in public and some by  stoning, and 84 were flogged many in public." - Amnesty International Report on Iran  2003 

  (v) at least 4 Iranian Asylum Seekers who were returned to Iran by Australia  have reportedly "disappeared" one of whom was reportedly killed.    (vi) these disappearances add to a tragic list of deaths and disappearances  which have occurred following deportations and repatriations triggered by a failure of  Australian authorities to correctly ascertain refugee status or monitor the situation of  returnees.   

 (b) calls on the Government to   (i) suspend forced deportations of Iranian asylum seekers whilst their safety  cannot be guaranteed and no monitoring of returned asylum seekers is undertaken.   (ii) release the details of the Memorandum Of Understanding with the Iranian  Government.
