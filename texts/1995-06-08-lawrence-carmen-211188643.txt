 GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE AND TRAUMA

 Refugees and migrants who have suffered torture or trauma  before coming to Australia will benefit from $1.4 million in  funding announced today.

 Announcing details, Federal Minister for Human Services and  Health, Dr Carmen Lawrence, said the funding would go to  services assisting refugees and migrants under the Federal  Government's Program of Assistance for Survivors of Torture 

 and Trauma.

 "The Program was established last year to assist refugees and  migrants to this country who have faced horrific  circumstances that most Australians only see on television or  read about in newspapers," Dr Lawrence said.

 "These people and their families often carry with them severe  physical and emotional problems as a result of torture,  terrorism, famine or many other kinds of trauma experienced  overseas.

 "They need to be able to use mainstream health services  quickly and they need help to access them.

 "This funding will support services across Australia who  provide counselling to survivors of torture and trauma and  have been of great comfort and reassurance to these people."

 The Program of Assistance for Survivors of Torture and Trauma  is a four year program that provides support for a range of  services, including training of service providers in the  special needs of survivors of torture and trauma, and the  development of volunteer networks to help survivors access  mainstream health and health-related services.

 "Today's Federal government funding will help services to  cope with the increasing numbers of refugees and migrants who  need assistance," Dr Lawrence said.

 "This move will not only help these people to come to terms  with their past, but it is a wise investment in Australia's  future."
