 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release   

 

 Rudd and Debus prove they’re unable to protect our borders   

 Australians have every reason to be concerned at the news that another 49 Middle Eastern  suspected illegal immigrants were intercepted at Ashmore Reef yesterday. 

 A vessel was intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy patrol boat HMAS Albany, operating  under the control of Border Protection Command, two nautical miles west of Ashmore Island. 

 This is the fourth boat intercepted in just three weeks bringing the total number of illegal  immigrants intercepted in the past year to reach 450. 

 This is outrageous and unfortunately reinforces that the Rudd Labor Government has made  no effort to enhance border protection techniques after off-handedly conceding that people  smugglers were using smarter techniques to come to our shores, Shadow Minister for  Customs and Justice Sussan Ley said. 

 “If people smugglers are getting savvy, then so will importers of drugs, weapons and other  contraband, so Rudd and his Government need to get savvy too,” she said.  

 Home Affairs Minister Bob Debus yesterday said the Rudd Government focus was “ensuring  that unauthorised arrivals don't touch the Australian mainland” and claimed that Australia’s  border security was a success because boats were prevented for reaching the shore. 

 “Just because boats don’t touch the mainland Minister Debus should not call his security a  success,” Ms Ley said. 

 “A successful policy would be not allowing them to enter our waters and to combat the  problem by intercepting the people smugglers before they attempted to travel to Australia -  not the other way around.” 

 Minister Debus has proved how ignorant he is by comparing us to Mediterranean countries  which receive thousands of land-based asylum seekers each year, Ms Ley said.   

 “Obviously these countries are facing different issues, and don’t have Australia’s vast  coastline or soft Government policies,” she said.

 Ms Ley said the Rudd Government was irresponsible in its approach to securing Australia’s  coastline and was not taking the current influx of asylum seekers seriously. 

 “Minister Debus has finally emerged to attend an international summit in Indonesia this week  discussing people smuggling but he cannot continue to rely on neighbouring countries to  detain illegal boats bound for our shores,” Ms Ley said. 

  “He seems to think it’s legitimate to rely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka to make up  the shortfall from the Rudd Government’s reckless slashing of the Customs budget. 

  “It is important to co-operate with other nations to combat the escalating problem, but it  should be a two-way process.” 

 Ms Ley said numbers of smugglers would continue to rise under current Labor policy and she  called on Kevin Rudd and Labor to act immediately to boost the level of funding needed by  Customs to manage the borders.
