 YEAR OF THE HORSE FESTIVITIES

 The Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Laurie Ferguson MP, has extended New Year’s greetings to the many Asian Australians who today celebrate the commencement of the Year of the Horse.

 ‘Many Chinese, Vietnamese and other Asian Australians will this week participate in traditional New Year celebrations with their families, friends and other community members,’ Mr Ferguson said.

 ‘These celebrations are an appropriate occasion to recognise the contribution of the Chinese and Vietnamese to Australia’s multicultural way of life.

 ‘Over 300,000 Australians speak a Chinese language at home and the Vietnamese community is estimated to be around 200,000 in size.

 ‘The migration history of the two communities is of course quite different.

 ‘Regardless of whether they arrived recently, or decades ago, as skilled migrants, refugees or under family reunion provisions, all were motivated to work hard to build a better life for themselves and their children.

 ‘Their high rates of Australian citizenship, and the multitude of community organisations that they have established to provide welfare, educational, cultural and other programs, and to raise funds for charitable purposes, are all testament to this commitment.

 ‘In conveying my personal best wishes to our Chinese and Vietnamese communities I assure them of the Opposition’s continuing commitment to multiculturalism.

 ‘Multiculturalism means not having to give up your cultural heritage to embrace the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. It is equally about economic efficiency as it is about social justice.

 ‘A telling reality is that today many Australians of diverse backgrounds are engaged in these New Year’s festivities.

 ‘I look forward to attending the Vietnamese New Year Festival at Warwick Farm in Sydney this Saturday, as I have done in past years, and to convey to those present the best wishes of the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean,’ Mr Ferguson concluded.
