 Launch of Frank Brennan’s    

 “Acting on Conscience”    

 

 Kevin Rudd MP 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade   and International Security  Federal Member for Griffith   

 Parliament House  Canberra  31 October 2006  

 

 

 

 

 It is good, right and proper that we are here today in Canberra to launch Frank  Brennan’s latest book “Acting on Conscience”.   

 And it is good, right and proper that we are launching it here in Parliament  House.   

 Because it is here in this place where Frank has earned the wrath of some, and  the admiration of many, in the best traditions of the vocation to which he is  called.   

 Some have called him a “meddling priest”.   

 I have always seen him, less prosaically, as an ethical burr in the nation’s saddle.   

 When the good ship Australia is sailing comfortably along with all, or at least  most, who sail within her, there is Frank:   

 â¢ prodding the national conscience on the rights of indigenous  Australians;   

 â¢ prodding the national conscience on asylum seekers; and    

 â¢ prodding the national conscience on East Timor.   

 But interestingly, rarely contenting himself to pious pronouncements from the  sidelines. Instead, active in the policy. And sometimes in the political ruck  itself. Which is where he often attracts the ire of the political class.   

 Which is why Frank may not pass theological muster in the Julie Bishop test  for admission to the new National Chaplaincy Corps.   

 This book is in large part about setting out a framework for religious  participation in Australian political life.    

 As soon as the topic is framed as such, there is an almost audible raising of the  hackles.    

 â¢ Familiar objections to the Church interfering in politics, in this country  borne of such debilitating historical experiences as Archbishop Mannix,  the “split” and the DLP;   

 â¢ reinforced by the argument that Australia has now become a secular  country; and   

 â¢ to the extent that it is not, then let us have a perfect separation of church  and state.    

 All this seems straight forward at first blush. But on closer examination they  bring to the fore complex questions for which there are no simple answers.   

 To begin with, our founding fathers got it absolutely right that there should be  a separation of church and state in Australia.   

 What this meant was that there should be no established religion in Australia as  the Australian state religion.   

 This was because they drew from American, rather than British, constitutional  precedents.   

 The American precedent was itself rightly shaped by a view of European  political history where for centuries an entire continent was laid waste by the  wars of religion.   

 But separation of church and state as a constitutional doctrine gives us no  specific guidance on how Christians, individually or corporately, should engage  the secular state.   

 This is a question of some importance as the census tells us that 70 per cent-plus of Australians, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, still believe in the  Christian God.   

 And Christianity has never been a privatised, pietized, meditative faith.   

 Christianity offers a range of social teachings from the sanctity of life through  to a deep commitment to social justice and the doctrine of a just war.   

 And these social teachings often run up hard against the political process  because they do not simply involve private discretionary decisions.   

 They may also require, or be impacted by, the collective action of society  through the agency of the state.   

 Many Christians believe they have a responsibility to form an active social  conscience. And therefore many need a conceptual framework for doing so.  This is where Frank’s book comes in.   

 Frank also deals with the consequential question of how an informed Christian  conscience can go about engaging the secular Australian state.    

 Christians are as entitled to articulate a political view on public policy in exactly  the same way as agnostics, atheists, humanists, capitalists, socialists and any  other theological, ideological and philosophical system on the planet or beyond.   

 Christians have no monopoly on morality.   

 In fact, their immorality has at certain times in history been unspeakable.   

 But their views, together with other views must be argued, distilled and debated  through a pluralist political system whose common forum is a fully  representative parliamentary democracy. 

 

 Finally, while Christians are as entitled as anyone else to argue their viewpoint  in the political process there is no such thing as a Christian political party;    

 God is not a wholly-own subsidiary of any political party.   

 This is where my friend and parliamentary colleague Tony Abbott in his  comments reported in today’s Sydney Morning Herald doesn’t seem to fully  appreciate the point I have been trying to make in my recent contributions to  the national debate on the church and state.    

 Tony attacks my seditious efforts as an attempt to “recruit from the pew”.   

 In fact, the whole point of my recent article is that God is neither Liberal,  Labor nor even Family First.    

 My argument also is that there is a strong social justice tradition in the Church  which political conservatives frequently conveniently ignore - often assuming  that concern for our fellow human beings is a private discretionary matter (a  type of 21st century noblesse oblige) but not a concern for the collective agency of  society through the state.   

 Tony also fails to answer my key challenge to the Centre-Right: namely the  destructive impact that market fundamentalism has on the family, the  community and common goods such as the environment. Industrial relations 

 and climate change bring these questions to centre stage today.   

 I await with interest a systematic rather than rhetorical response from the latter  day disciples of Friedrich Hayek on these great ethical questions of out time.   

 The Church, when at its best in human history, keeps all of us in politics on our  toes.   

 It should also keep all of us in politics at an appropriate distance, recognising  that the business of politics often involves compromise which may offend deep  principle.   

 Frank’s book, in the best tradition of the meddling priest, does not confine his  interventions to the political process, but also to the inner workings of the  Church itself.   

 Catholic social teaching offers a rich tradition of social justice and concern for  the sanctity of life.   

 Catholic social institutions (hospitals, schools, universities) have made a  significant contribution to the evolution of the Australian conscience in action.   

 But within the Church, there is also a long-standing debate on the doctrine of  the primacy of an informed, individual conscience.    

 Frank’s position on this debate is clear - that there is a primacy to be attached  to a properly informed conscience.   

 Of course that is a debate for Frank to have with his hierarchy.   

 But it is a principle worthy of application to any institution, Christian or  secular, that seeks to command our total commitment.   

 With those few words, I have great pleasure in launching Frank Brennan’s new  book - “Acting on Conscience” in the hope that it adds light to the current  Australian debate on the proper engagement between Christians and the state.    

 Frank, please come and bless and address us all.
