 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 RESIGNATION OF IMMIGRATION CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER RINGS ALARM  BELLS    

 Peter Dutton can no longer hide the dysfunction and distress within the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection following reports of the resignation of the Chief  Medical Officer and Surgeon General who is responsible for overseeing healthcare and  medical treatment of asylum seekers and refugees.   

 Labor wrote to Peter Dutton three weeks ago and is yet to receive a response to our  concerns about delays in the medical transfer process for asylum seekers and refugees  on Manus Island and Nauru.     

 Labor has sought assurance that medical transfers will be available when required and  recommended by medical experts - including women seeking reproductive health  assistance and treatment for perinatal depression.   

 The reported resignation of the joint Chief Medical Officer and Surgeon General rings  alarm bells because of the critically important role this doctor plays in ensuring medical  care is provided as well as based on the best medical advice.   

 This development is typical of Peter Dutton's ongoing incompetence in the management  of his portfolio; especially the management of offshore processing arrangements.     

 How has the Immigration Minister allowed a situation where thousands of people in his  care across Australia’s onshore and offshore immigration network have been left  without an advocate in the Chief Medical Officer?   

 Under the Abbott-Turnbull Government, morale has collapsed within the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian National Audit Office has released  multiple scathing reports critical of departmental processes, and asylum seekers and  refugees have been left to languish on Manus Island and Nauru for four years with no  other viable third country resettlement options being negotiated.   

 Peter Dutton needs to get his house in order and guarantee asylum seekers and  immigration detainee’s capacity to access medical treatment will not suffer as a result of  his incompetence to manage his own Department.
