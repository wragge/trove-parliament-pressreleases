  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Philip Ruddock, has  announced two appointments to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) . 

  Ms Kerry Boland has been appointed as a full-time Senior Member in Melbourne and  Mr David McCulloch has been appointed as a new part-time Member to the Tribunal's  Sydney registry. 

  "Ms Boland has been appointed as a Senior Member to undertake management and  administrative duties following the early resignation of the Acting Deputy Principal  Member in August this year," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "She is an experienced Member who has worked at the Tribunal for more than four  years and has an extensive background in refugee issues." 

  The Minister said Mr McCulloch's appointment followed the recent resignations of two  Members (one full-time and one part-time) from the Sydney registry and would help to  ensure productivity levels were maintained. 

  Mr McCulloch has experience as a legal practitioner and in public administration and  advice. 

  He has been appointed until 28 July 2000 and Ms Boland has been appointed until 9  June 2000. 

  The RRT is the independent review organisation which considers decisions made by  the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse applications for  protection visas (ie refugee status).
