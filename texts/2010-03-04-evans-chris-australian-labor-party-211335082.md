 New senior appointment to review tribunals  Thursday, 4 March 2010 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today announced  the appointment of Amanda MacDonald as deputy principal member of the Migration  Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). 

 Ms MacDonald is currently a senior member of the tribunals. She joined the MRT in  2001 and was cross-appointed to the RRT in 2006. 

 During 2007-08, she was also a senior member of the Veterans' Review Board.  Earlier in her career, she spent three years as a district registrar and conference  registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and 13 years as a member and  registrar of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Ms MacDonald holds a Masters of  Administrative Law and Policy from the University of Sydney. 

 'Ms MacDonald brings a wealth of tribunal experience to these positions which will  enable her to provide leadership and management support to the principal member,'  Senator Evans said. 

 'I look forward to her contribution to both tribunals in this new role.' 

 She was selected following a merit-based process by a panel which included  Department of Immigration and Citizenship Secretary Andrew Metcalfe, Principal  Member of the Tribunals Denis O’Brien, Executive Councillor and Head of  Secretariat of the COAG Reform Council Mary Ann O'Loughlin (representing the  Australian Public Service Commission), and John Gibson, a community  representative and President of the Refugee Council of Australia.
