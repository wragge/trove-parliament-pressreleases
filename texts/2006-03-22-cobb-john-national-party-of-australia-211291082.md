 Extending Assistance for Melbourne's Newly Arrived Young People  

 22/03/2006 

 The Minister for Community Services, John Cobb, today presented nearly $450 000 in funding to the Centre for  Multicultural Youth Issues (CMYI), enabling them to continue to assist with culturally appropriate services for  newly arrived young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.   

 Mr Cobb said the funding is part of the Howard Government's 2004-05 Budget announcement of $8 million for the  expansion of the existing Reconnect and Job Placement, Employment and Training programmes to specifically  help newly arrived young people.    

 "The Newly Arrived Youth Support Service (NAYSS) initiative was established following the Report of the Review  of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants, which showed newly arrived young people do not  take up the opportunity for assistance through mainstream services at the same rate as other young Australians,"  Mr Cobb said.   

 "As one of eight organisations across Australia who have successfully applied for funding under Phase 2 of the  initiative, CMYI will expand their services to assist newly arrived young people and families in Moonee Valley,  Brimbank and Hume.   

 "CMYI is a statewide community-based organisation in Victoria, directly assisting young people from refugee and  newly arrived communities and is also the NAYSS national lead provider, providing information, training and  resources for other NAYSS providers across the country.   

 "By providing a service which is flexible and tailored to local circumstances and individual needs, NAYSS  providers assist newly arrived young people aged 12 to 21 improve their level of engagement with family, work,  education, training and the community.   

 "Through the use of a variety of strategies such as counselling, family mediation and practical support, NAYSS  providers improve the opportunities for newly arrived young people to participate in the economic and social life of  the Australian community," Mr Cobb said.
