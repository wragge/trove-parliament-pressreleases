 [Introduction ] 

 1.  It is a pleasure to join you t his evening . 

 I thank the Human Rights Law Resource Centre 

 for organising this event . 

 2.  This 60 th  anniversary year of the Universal 

 Declaration of Human Rights draws us all to 

 reflect on the protection of human rights over  the 

 last half of the 20 th  century.  

 And to reinvigorate our  human rights  ag enda  for  

 the 21 st  century.  

 3.  It is timely, sixty years on, to draw inspiration 

 from the Declaration as we review our  guiding 

 principles for human rights in Australia and as 

 we work to take our commitment to the next 

 level.  

 4.  And it is timely that in the year w e celebrate this 

 special anniversary, the Rudd Government is 

 injecting renewed vigour in to the cause of human 

 rights.  

 5.  We are committed to ensuring a fair go for all 

 Australians.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008

 6.  And as  Federal Attorney -General, I consider the 

 primacy of the  law , informed b y human rights,  as 

 fundamental to  Australia’s democracy.  

 7.  Most of us have grown up in Australia, or chosen 

 to live here, knowing that our  democracy is  

 strong.   

 8.  But democracy is more than placing voting 

 papers in a ballot box.  True democracy must be 

 underpi nned by a respect for human rights.  

 9.  The way we govern ourselves and conduct our 

 affairs as a democratic nation hasn’t  happened 

 by chance - we need to continually work at it to 

 keep the rule of law in good order  and to ensure 

 social inclusion . 

 10.  Tonight I wil l outline to you only a few things I 

 am doi ng as part of the Rudd  Government’s 

 commitment to human rights.  

 [National Human Rights Consultation ] 

 11.  The 2020 Summit earlier this year was a clear 

 indication  that Australians are interested in 

 stronger human right s protections.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008

 12.  Some of the themes em erging from the Summit 

 included promoting gender equality , 

 strengthening the protection of human rights in 

 Australia, and affirming Australia’s commitment 

 to international institutions and th e international 

 rule of law.  

 13.  To this end, the Government is proceeding 

 towards community consultation on how best to 

 protect the rights and responsibilities of all 

 Australians.  

 14.  I want to emphasise that the outcome of the 

 consultation is not predetermined - any new 

 approach to human ri ghts will flow from the 

 views of the Australian people.  

 

 [Engagement with the U nited Nations ] 

 15.  In the meantime, the Rudd Government is 

 committed - through intent and action - to living 

 up  to Australia’s international human rights 

 obligations.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008

 This is centra l to our commitment to upholding 

 the rule of law.  

 16.  Australia must look  beyond its own borders to 

 support and protect human rights.  

 We must work to be at the forefront of the 

 development  of international standards.  

 17.  And a t a global level, the Rudd Government has 

 already demonstrated our commitment to re -engage with the United Nations to promote the 

 rule of law in ternationally.  

 18.  We are well advanced in the long overdue 

 process of becoming a party to a number of key 

 international instruments opposed, or sat on, b y 

 the former Government.  

 [Rights of People with a Disability ] 

 19.  A little over two weeks ago, Australia was one of 

 the first Western countries to ratify the  United 

 Nations Convention on the Rights of People with 

 a Disabilit y. 

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 7 

 20.  This se nds a strong and unequivoc al message - 

 Australians living with a disability will not be 

 treated like second class citizens.  

 21.  This convention  is the first major human rights 

 treaty of the 21 st  ce ntury, and one of the fastest  

 treaties ever negotiated and brought into force . 

 22.  Finally, we have an  international legal 

 instrument that clearly sets out that  people living 

 with a disability should have access to full and 

 equal enjoyment of human rights and 

 fundamental freedoms.  

 23.  I thank all the Australian NGOs who 

 participated  in the consultatio ns leading to 

 ratification.  

 24.  Now that we have ratified the Convention, in the 

 coming weeks the Government  will commence 

 consultations on the Optional Protocol to the 

 Convention - and I encourage you to take part in 

 this process.  

 25.  The Rudd Government’s quick and decisive 

 action in ratifying the Disability Convention 

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 8 

 demonstrates our preparedness to commit 

 Australia to new human rights instruments 

 where appropriate.  

 

 [Optional Protocol - Torture ] 

 26.  And for this reason, we are also working toward 

 becoming a party  to  the Optional Protocol to the 

 United Nations  Convention Against Torture . 

 27.  Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 

 treatment clearly have no place in Australia.  

 28.  The Protocol establishes a sub -committee to 

 conduct visits to places of detention, including 

 prisons and immigration detention centres.  

 29.  I believe that these mechanisms would 

 complement existing arrangements in Australia 

 to ensure detainees are treated humanly and by 

 internationally accepted standards.  

 30.  Further to this, the Rudd Government is also 

 mo ving to clearly and explicitly implement our 

 international obligation to prohibit torture.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 9 

 31.  Although our domestic criminal laws already 

 contain offences which, collectively, outlaw all 

 acts of  torture, the Committee Against Torture 

 has called upon all natio ns to enact a specific 

 torture offence.  

 32.  And  I am pleased to  announce  tonight  that this 

 week I have written to the States and Territories, 

 consulting them on the development of 

 Commonwealth legislation to prohibit torture.  

 33.  We are committed to ensuring that our domestic 

 law clearly prohibits these deplorable acts.  

 34.  And to send ing  the strong message, both within 

 Australia  and internationally , that this 

 Government will take whatever steps are 

 necessary to eliminate the use  of  torture, 

 wherever it occurs and whom ever commits it.  

 [Optional Protocol - CEDAW ] 

 35.  And last week marked the 25th anniversary of 

 Australia’s ratification of the United Nations 

 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

 Discrimination against Women.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 10

 36.  Sitting underneath this is the Optional Pro tocol 

 to the Convention, which was never actioned by 

 the former Government.  

 37.  The Rudd Government is committed to women’s 

 rights internationally.  

 And this Protocol would enable Australian 

 women to complain directly to the United Nations 

 if they feel Australi a is not living up to its 

 international obligations.  

 38.  The Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya 

 Plibersek and I have recently consulted on the 

 issue of Australia becoming a party to this 

 important Optional Protocol.  

 39.  And in the coming weeks I hope to tabl e in the 

 Federal Parliament a National Interest Analysis , 

 the next key step in becoming a party to this 

 Optional Protocol.  

 40.  Regrettably, women in our region of the world 

 are among the most exploited.  Human 

 trafficking is rife  and basic health and education  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 11

 standards are wanting.  It is time for Australia to 

 stand up to our international responsibilities.  

 

 [Standing U nited Nations  Invitation]  

 41.  And our commitment does not end with 

 becoming a party to these international 

 instruments.  

 42.  Australians are matter of f act people.  

 Instinctively, they know we must be prepared to 

 be judged by the standards we expect other 

 countries to meet.  

 43.  The former Government had a defensive 

 approach to visits by t he United Nations to 

 Australia, almost regarding it as an affront that 

 international human rights experts would dare 

 suggest that a visit to Australia was appropriate.  

 44.  I am pleased to announce tonight that the Rudd 

 Government has agreed to issue a standing 

 invitation to Australia  for United Nations  human 

 rights Special Rapport eurs and other experts.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 12

 45.  This initiative demonstrates the Rudd 

 Government’s willingness to engage with the 

 international community on how best to 

 implement human rights obligations in the same 

 way we expect other countries to engage with 

 these processes.  

 46.  By  extending a standing invitation, the Rudd 

 Government makes it clear that we will accept 

 request s for visits from the United Nations.  

 This is something that likeminded countries, such 

 as New Zealand and Canada , have done for some 

 time.  

 47.  And it demonstrates the Rudd Government’s 

 commitment to engage  more positively with the 

 United Nations  in implementing our human 

 rights obligations.  

 48.  I noted with interest comments by the 

 Opposition  earlier this year, indicating their 

 objective of  reclaim ing  the mantle of the party 

 committed to the rule of law.   

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 13

 49.  We certainly welcome that aspiration, but m y 

 view is that a Government or Opposition cannot 

 profess a commitment to the rule of law, without 

 being clear on its position on international 

 human rights  instruments  and the  important  

 relationship with the United Nations.  

 

 [Other Areas ] 

 50.  And o f course, the work the Rudd Government is 

 doing in this area is not limited to my portfolio.  

 51.  One of the first acts of the Minister for 

 Immigration was to end  the so -called Pacific 

 solution , by closing Nauru and Manus and 

 bringing all those people found to be refugees to 

 Australia.  

 The estimated cost of running these facilities was 

 $314 million.  

 52.  And the Rudd Government ensured the abolition 

 of Temporary Protection visas.  

 53.  We also recently ann ounced a suite of reforms to 

 Australia's immigration  detention system.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 14

 54.  The new policy will result in a risk -based 

 approach to detention so that a person who poses 

 no danger to the community will be not be held in 

 a detention centre and children will not be  

 detained in an immigration detention centre  at 

 all.  

 55.  For the cases being processed at Christmas 

 Island they will receive legal assistance and 

 access to independent review of unfavourable 

 decisions.  

 56.  Our reforms, being led by my colleague, Senator 

 Chris Evan s, Minister for Immigration and 

 Citizenship demonstrate a more humanitarian 

 approach - an approach based on decency . 

 57.  Similarly , the Rudd Government's historic 

 apology to Indigenous Australians earlier this 

 year was, I believe, a positive and healing move t o 

 unite all Australians.  

 58.  It was an outstanding occasion in Australia's 

 history, and we want to build on that.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 15

 59.  Regrettably, the plight of Indigenous Australians 

 generally continues to be one of the most serious 

 and persistent human rights challenges facing  

 Australia.  

 60.  The Rudd Government is progressing a number 

 of initiatives aimed at  close the gap between 

 indigenous and non -indigenous Australians 

 including in life expectancy, infant mortality, 

 education, housing and employment . 

 61.  And I am working in the area of native title, with 

 my colleague Minister Jenny Macklin, to 

 encourage parties to set aside old attitudes and 

 cr eatively engage with each other to achieve long 

 term sustainable intergenerational outcomes.  

  [Access to Justice ] 

 62.  Similarly, I am firmly of the  view that ensuring 

 access to justice is an important part of the rule 

 of law.  

 It is also central to our concern for strengthening 

 human rights and promoting social inclusion.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 16

 63.  Some of you will be aware that I am considering 

 various reforms to improve the c onduct of 

 litigation.  

 64.  Over the past number of months I have made my 

 view known that whilst court resources are finite, 

 and more needs to be done to make justice 

 available to everyone.  

 Not  merely for those who can afford protracted  

 litigation.  

 65.  Our justice s ystem suffers when it is misused, for 

 example when legal action is threatened or 

 commenced to achieve collateral purposes.  

 66.  I believe legitimate public debate and proper 

 conduct of litigation warrant further 

 examination.  

 67.  And as I embark upon this, I am alwa ys 

 interested to hear suggestions  on how  to improv e 

 the administration of and access to justice.  

 [Conclusion ] 

 68.  It is, I think, a very exciting time.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 17

 69.  We have  acted quickly  since coming into 

 Government  to progress Australia’s human 

 rights agenda - nationally  and internationally.  

 70.  At the same time, a  strong, comprehensive 

 system of human rights protections cannot exist 

 or flourish without respecting and upholding the 

 rule of law.  

 We will continue to do both.  

 71.  I want you to know that the Government’s 

 support for and protection of the most vulnerable 

 and disadvantaged in our community is an 

 ongoing priority.  

 Martin Luther King once said injustice anywhere 

 is a threat to justice everywhere . 

 72.  In summing up, I made an important 

 appointment today to the Human Rights and  

 Equally Opportunity Commission.  

 73.  Justice Catherine Branson of the Federal Court 

 of Australia will become President of the 

 Commission, starting in October for a 5 year 

 term.  

 

 Human Rights Law Resource Centre   7 August 2008  

 18

 74.  I am confident she will provide a significant 

 contribution to the promotion, unders tanding 

 and recognition of human rights in Australia.  

 We look forward to working with her to ensure a 

 fair go for all Australians.  

 75.  I thank the Honourable John von Doussa QC, 

 the current President for his contribution.  

 76.  And I t hank you all for what you do to  support 

 the fundamental principles that guide this 

 important  agenda .
