 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 11 August 2014   

 Abbott government must come clean on dirty  deal with Cambodia   

 The Australian Greens have called on the Abbott government to release the details of a concerning  deal with Cambodia that would see Australia dump refugees in the impoverished nation.   

 “This is a dirty deal to dump refugees in an impoverished and war-torn nation,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “There is no way that Tony Abbott can ensure the safety of children that his government dumps in  Cambodia.   

 “The Abbott government wants to set up franchises in cruelty across our region and it’s  disappointing to see Cambodia being swindled like this.   

 “There is still no details on the conditions that families will be dumped into and no information on  the size of the bribe Australia is giving to Cambodia to make this all happen. The Minister for Secrecy  is trying to keep the Australian public in the dark once again.   

 “Rather than dumping refugees in one of the poorest nations on Earth, Australia should be working  with its neighbours on a genuine regional solution.”
