 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration  THE HOWARD GOVERNMENT - RETURNING IRAQI  ASYLUM SEEKERS TO THE WAR ZONE   

 In seeking to justify Australia’s involvement in the Iraq war, the Howard Government has  paraded its concern for the plight of the Iraqi people.  The Prime Minister said in his address  to the nation that Saddam Hussein’s regime:   

 “…is an appalling regime: its torture, its use of rape as an instrument of intimidation, the  cruelty to children to extract confessions from parents. It is a terrible catalogue of inflicting  human misery on a people who deserve much better.” 

 

 Now, in stark contrast to this rhetoric we learn that the Howard Government has returned  failed Iraqi asylum seekers to countries which border Iraq and is boasting about returning 6  Iraqi asylum seekers in the last six weeks. 

 

 The Secretary of the Department of Immigration, Mr Bill Farmer verified in Senate Estimates  on 11 February that the policy of the Howard Government in relation to returning Iraqis is:   

 “…they are liable for removal, they can go at any time they like . . . The individuals can  return to Iraq under a number of circumstances.  They can go to a country like Jordan and  cross the border for example.”   

 Today, it is revealed, in answer to a parliamentary question on notice that six Iraqis have been  returned by the Howard Government since 10 February 2003.   

 In question time today I asked Minister Ruddock to confirm that in the last six weeks the  Howard Government has returned Iraqis to countries neighbouring Iraq, which are bracing for  huge refugee outflows from the Iraq war.  I also asked Minister Ruddock to verify these six  people were safe.   

 Minister Ruddock did neither.  Instead, apparently confused by the difference between Syria  and New Zealand, he claimed an Iraqi family had managed to travel from Australia to Syria  and then New Zealand.   

 This, in itself, seems incredible. But even if that has occurred it does not answer the question.   Where are the six Iraqi asylum seekers returned in the last six weeks?  Are they safe?  And  what is the Australian public to make of the values and ethics of a Government that justifies  waging war to protect human rights while returning people to countries bordering the combat?
