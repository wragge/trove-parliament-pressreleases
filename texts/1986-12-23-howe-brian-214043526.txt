 COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT GRANTS FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF

 Emergency relief services in New South Wales will receive 

 grants totalling $2,409,000 from the Commonwealth Government.

 Details of the grants were announced today by the Acting 

 Minister for Community Services, the Hon Brian Howe MP.

 Mr Howe said that the funds include an amount of $232,000 for 

 68 welfare agencies catering for the special needs of 

 Aboriginal people.

 Emergency relief assists people who need financial support in 

 times of crisis.

 The Commonwealth Government makes funds available to community 

 and welfare organisations to supplement the traditional State 

 Government and .voluntary sector services.

 Mr Howe said that he had approved the grants after receiving 

 advice from the Advisory Committee on Emergency Relief. This 

 Committee takes into account such factors as the needs of 

 regions as well as the suitability of the agencies themselves 

 for the task of distributing funds before making its 

 recommendations.

 During this financial year the Commonwealth Government is 

 providing $6.32 million to welfare agencies throughout 

 Australia for emergency relief.
