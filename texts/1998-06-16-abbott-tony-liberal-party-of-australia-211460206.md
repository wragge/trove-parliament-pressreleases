  NEW PROJECTS FOR DISADVANTAGED 
YOUNG AUSTRALIANS

  

  More than 10,500 young people at   risk will benefit from 
an extended program aimed at helping them to find work, access training 
or re-enter the education system, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Tony 
Abbott, announced today.

  

  Nationally, over 100 organisations will be offered contracts for the 
1998-99 Job Placement, Employment and Training (JPET) services, as part 
of $14.3 million strengthening of the program, Mr Abbott said.

  

  JPET projects assist young people aged 15-21 who are homeless or are 
at risk of becoming homeless, those who have had contact with the juvenile 
justice system or who are currently or have been wards of the state 
as well as refugees.

  

  The new round of projects will provide 10,652 participant places, 
an increase of 2,352 places over 1997-98.

  

  Ongoing support and referral to employment services, education and 
training organisations are provided to young people to help them overcome 
problems such as family conflict, drug and alcohol abuse, sexual abuse 
or other forms of violence and abuse, and literacy and numeracy difficulties.

  

  Mr Abbott said JPET services play an equally significant role in helping 
these young people find work, access training or re-enter education.

  

  "The assistance provided through JPET will make a significant, 
long-term difference to the future prospects of thousands of young Australians,” 
he said.

  

  “JPET services provide professional assessment of barriers, preventing 
a client from participating in education, pre-vocational vocational 
training or gaining and maintaining employment. Individual programmes 
are planned for each client based on their current life and work skill 
levels.

  

  “For example,   John  appeared in front of a magistrate, 
charged with stealing. John’s Newstart Allowance was cut off when 
he failed to fill in his job search diary properly. The JPET worker 
helped him fill out his diary, work out a job search plan and assisted 
him to prepare his application for a position as a storeman. The JPET 
worker also helped him with his job interview and he was successful 
in getting the position.

  

  "  Simone  dropped out of school, took up a career of crime and 
was under the supervision of juvenille justice. With JPET's help she 
is now in full-time employment and has enrolled at TAFE to complete 
her Year 10 certificate.

  

  “Around 8,300 young people have already been assisted through JPET 
which was re-established in 1996 to fulfil a commitment made in the 
Coalition policy document,   Pathways to Real Jobs ," he said.

  

  Previously funded JPET activities for young people have included improving 
their literacy and numeracy skills, developing greater self-esteem, 
pre-vocational training, practical work experience and reducing re-offending 
by juvenile offenders.

  

  Young people who want to find out how they can take part in the JPET 
program should contact their nearest Centrelink Office or call the toll-free 
information line on 1 800 657 569.
