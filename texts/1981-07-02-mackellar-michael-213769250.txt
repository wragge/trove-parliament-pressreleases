 FROM THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTER FOR HEALTH  THE HON. M. J. R. MACKELLAR

 PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN ON NEW HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

 The Government's campaign to publicise the new  health insurance arrangements being introduced on  1 September this year has moved into high gear.

 The Minister for Health, the Hon. Michael MacKellar,  said today that the printing of an explanatory pamphlet  had begun and copies were now being distributed.

 A total of 4.5 million copies.will be available  through Australia Post Offices,  doctors' surgeries,  retail pharmacies, private hospitals and health insurance  funds, as well as Commonwealth Department of Health and  Social Security offices. .

 Copies are already available at Department of  Social Security offices. Supplies to other recipients  will be delivered progressively.over the next 10 to 14  days.

 Mr MacKellar said the pamphlet —  entitled  'In Sickness and in Health —  better value for your dollar'  —   explained the new arrangements in simple terms and provided  clear advice on -what action (if any) each individual in  the community needed to take.

 The Minister said: "To assist people further the Government has decided that:-.  a telephone 'hot-line'  service should be set up  to answer any queries from the public on the new 

 health policy. The service is to begin in all  States on 3 August and operate until the end of  September. For the price of a local call, people  will be. able to telephone from anywhere in a State 

 and seek advice from Social Security and Health  Department experts who will man the 'hot-line'   between noon and 2 pm each week-day and from 6 pm  to 9 pm each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. ·

 .  The Department of Social Security should arrange a  series of briefings for welfare and other community  groups and individuals who would in turn assist : their 'clients' to fully understand the new arrange­ ments. These groups would include welfare agencies,  Aboriginal and migrant community leaders, hospital 

 administration staff and social workers, doctors'  receptionists, health fund staff and Parliamentarians'  staff. The Department of Social Security has prepared  an audio-visual presentation to assist with the briefings

 In addition explanations of the new policy and its  implications are being sent out by the Department of  Social Security to:-pensioners holding a Pensioner Health Benefit card; 

 other pensioners; 

 the unemployed; and

 mothers receiving family allowance cheques.

 Special steps are being taken to advise ethnic groups  of the new policy. Translations of a pamphlet summarising  details of the new arrangements for people with Pensioner  Health Benefits (PHB) cards,  for those with pensions: or 

 benefits who do not have PHB cards,  and for people In special  need —  that is migrants and refugees, people on unemployment  or special benefit and people on low incomes are currently  being prepared. The pamphlets will be available in Greek, 

 Italian, Serbian, Croatian, Arabic, Turkish, Spanish and  Vietnamese. They will be distributed to appropriate groups,  through the Department of Social Security!s state offices.  Details of the new policy are also to be broadcast on ethnic 

 radio stations. .

 Mr MacKellar concluded by saying:- "The Government will  be closely monitoring the operation of these programs. Our  aim is to ensure that all people become fully aware of our new  health policy. If it becomes apparent that additional measures  are necessary we will undertake them."
