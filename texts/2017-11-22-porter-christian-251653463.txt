 Government seeks new approaches to tackle welfare dependency 

 Migrants and refugees, at risk young people, Newstart recipients over 50 years of age and carers will  benefit from the next tranche of the Government’s $96.1 million Try, Test and Learn Fund. 

 Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, officially opened the second round of funding at his  address to the National Press Club in Canberra today. 

 “The Try, Test and Learn Fund is about trialling innovative projects to help improve the lives of  vulnerable Australians and help them break from welfare dependency,” Mr Porter said. 

 “Tranche two will build on the success and learnings of the first tranche, implementing and  evaluating new policy responses to support our next priority groups with innovative ideas to help  them become self-reliant.  

 “Already we have invested more than $23 million across 14 initiatives aimed at helping young carers,  young students and young parents.” 

 Minister Porter said the Australian Priority Investment Approach data highlighted four groups for the  next tranche who were at particular risk of welfare dependency.  

 Migrants and refugees 

 ï· As at June 2017 there were 299,400 in this category. They are expected to have an average  future lifetime cost of $340,000 per person, and, on average, are expected to be on income  support for some or all of 30 years over their future lifetime.  

 At risk young people 

 ï· This category consists of young people receiving Youth Allowance (other) or young people  receiving Disability Support Pension with mental health as the primary medical condition, of  whom there were 109,000 as at June 2017. They are expected to have an average future  lifetime cost of $306,000 per person, and, on average, are expected to be on income support  for some or all of 35 years over their future lifetime. 

 Newstart Allowance recipients aged 50 and over 

 

 

 ï· As at June 2017 there were 251,400 people in this category. They are expected to have an  average future lifetime cost of $320,000 per person, and, on average, are expected to be on  income support for some or all of 26 years over their future lifetime. 

 Carers 

 ï· As at June 2017 there were 221,700 in this category. They are expected to have an average  future lifetime cost of $461,000 per person, and, on average, are expected to be on income  support for some or all of 34 years over their future lifetime. 

 

 “By selecting these priority groups, we are continuing to focus on life circumstances that could lead  to welfare dependency,” Minister Porter said.  

 “For example, there are 195,000 Newstart Allowance recipients aged 50 or over who have been  receiving an income support payment for over 12 months. 

 “These are people who are ready to work, have valuable skills and experience, and would benefit  from work. All they need is the support to get there. 

 “We will also accept submissions for other vulnerable groups at risk of long-term welfare  dependence. Grant applicants will need to be able to identify these other vulnerable groups within  the data, other research or from experience in working with vulnerable people.”    

 This tranche will have a continuously open application period from now until the end of September  2018, which will allow individuals and organisations to submit proposals at any time. 

 Funding will be provided to approved submissions to refine and optimise project design through  co-development, prior to implementation.

 Try, Test and Learn Fund   - Working age carers

 What we know  At 30 June 2017 there were around 221,700  working age carers. The latest Priority  Investment Approach valuation shows that  the expected average future lifetime cost for  working age carers is $461,000 per person. 

 The estimated total future lifetime cost for  the group is $102.3 billion. On average, this  group is expected to receive income support  for some or all of 34 years over the rest of  their lives. Sixty-two per cent are expected to  receive income support for some or all of  every year for the rest of their lives. 

 If nothing changes, 80 per cent will be  receiving income support payments in 10  years, and 73 per cent will be receiving  income support payments in 20 years. 

 Working age carers  This priority group is defined as carers aged  16 to 64 years who are on Carer Payment.  

 Analysis of working age carers shows that  they are particularly vulnerable to the risk of  long-term welfare dependency.  

 Carers face several barriers in accessing  employment. Due to their caring 

 1  ABS data 

 responsibilities, they have limited time  available to work. Over time, their lack of  work experience can become an additional  barrier to work. Carers have indicated that  they need more flexibility in support services  and ‘carer-friendly’ workplaces. 

 

 

 Try, Test and Learn Fund  The Try, Test and Learn Fund will seek new  and innovative policy responses that support  groups identified by Priority Investment  Approach analysis as being at risk of long-term welfare dependency. 

 Working age carers 

 â¢ 56 per cent labour force participation  (compared to 80 per cent labour force  participation for non-carers)1  

 â¢ 71 per cent are female  â¢ 60 per cent are aged between 46 and  64  

 â¢ 33 per cent live in inner and outer  regional areas

 Try, Test and Learn Fund   - Older Newstart Allowance recipients

 What we know  At 30 June 2017 there were around 251,400  people aged 50 or over receiving Newstart  Allowance. The latest Priority Investment  Approach valuation shows that the expected  average future lifetime cost for older  Newstart Allowance recipients is $320,000  per person. 

 The estimated total future lifetime cost for  the group is $80.5 billion. On average, this  group is expected to receive income support  for some or all of 26 years over the rest of  their lives. Fifty-six per cent are expected to  receive income support for some or all of  every year for the rest of their lives. 

 If nothing changes, 75 per cent will be  receiving income support payments in 10  years, and 74 per cent will be receiving  income support payments in 20 years. 

 Older Newstart Allowance  recipients  This priority group is defined as Newstart  Allowance recipients aged 50 or over.  

 Older workers on Newstart Allowance  represent a loss of skills and experience to  the labour force, while increasing  expenditure on unemployment payments  and age pensions, and reducing taxation  revenue from older workers.  

 

 

 

 Many older Australians want to work but find  it difficult to get work. At June 2017 there  were 195,000 Newstart Allowance recipients  aged 50 or over who have been on income  support for 12 months or over.  

 For many older workers, their health can  also be a barrier to employment. There are  81,600 Newstart Allowance recipients aged  50 and over who have an assessed partial  capacity to work. 

 Try, Test and Learn Fund  The Try, Test and Learn Fund will seek new  and innovative policy responses that support  groups identified by Priority Investment  Approach analysis as being at risk of long-term welfare dependency. 

 Older Newstart Allowance recipients 

 â¢ 53 per cent are female  â¢ 32 per cent are aged 50-54  â¢ 32 per cent are aged 55-59  â¢ 35 per cent are aged 60-64  â¢ 32 per cent have a partial capacity to 

 work 

 â¢ 35 per cent live in inner and outer  regional areas

 Try, Test and Learn Fund   - Migrants and refugees on income support

 What we know  At 30 June 2017 there were 299,400 working  age Australians from migrant and refugee  backgrounds on working age payments, 35  per cent male and 65 per cent female. The  latest Priority Investment Approach valuation  shows the expected average future lifetime  cost for migrants and refugees receiving  working age payments is $340,000 per  person. 

 The estimated total future lifetime cost for  the group is $101.9 billion. On average, this  group is expected to receive income support  for some or all of 30 years over the rest of  their lives.

 Migrants and refugees  This priority group is defined as migrants and  refugees aged 16 to 64 years who are on  working age payments. 

 Humanitarian entrants are generally entitled  to income support without having to serve  any waiting periods including the Newly  Arrived Residents Waiting Period. 

 

 

 

 Most migrants (other than humanitarian  migrants) do not have immediate access to  income support payments when they first  arrive in Australia with most being required  to serve the 104 week Newly Arrived  Residents Waiting Period for income support  payments and a 10 year qualifying residency  period for Age Pension and Disability  Support Pension. 

 Try, Test and Learn Fund  The Try, Test and Learn Fund will seek new  and innovative policy responses that support  groups identified by Priority Investment

 Try, Test and Learn Fund   - At-risk young people on income support

 What we know  At 30 June 2017 there were around 109,000  young people receiving Youth Allowance  (other) or receiving Disability Support  Pension with mental health as the primary  condition. The latest Priority Investment  Approach valuation shows that young people  with these characteristics in 2016 have an  average future lifetime cost of $306,000 per  person. 

 The estimated total future lifetime cost for  the group is $33.4 billion. On average, this  group is expected to receive income support  for some or all of 35 years over the rest of  their lives. Eleven per cent are expected to  receive income support for some or all of  every year for the rest of their lives.  

 If nothing changes, 42 per cent will be  receiving income support payments in 10  years, and 33 per cent will be receiving  income support payments in 20 years. 

 At-risk young people  This priority group is defined as young  people aged 16 to 21 receiving Youth  Allowance (other) or Disability Support  Pension (with a mental health condition).  

 The needs and barriers to employment for  members of this group are highly varied and 

 they may have a number of indicators of  vulnerability.  

 

 

 

 These can include disengagement from  education, experience of severe family  breakdown, history of abuse, drug and  alcohol misuse, family instability including  living in out-of-home care and experiences  with the juvenile justice system. 

 

 Try, Test and Learn Fund  The Try, Test and Learn Fund will seek new  and innovative policy responses that support  groups identified by Priority Investment  Approach analysis as being at risk of long-term welfare dependency.
