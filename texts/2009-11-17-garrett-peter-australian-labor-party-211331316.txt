 NEW FESTIVALS AUSTRALIA GRANTS ANNOUNCED

 Arts Minister Peter Garrett today announced funding of $420,500 for arts and  cultural activities at 27 community festivals around Australia. 

 “Festivals in outer regional and remote communities will have the opportunity to add  special arts and performance projects to their programs, such as dance workshops,  storytelling, circus arts, puppetry and film,” Mr Garrett said. 

 “These new projects add exciting elements to the celebrations and help regional  tourism, as well as community spirit, in these towns.”

 Mr Garrett welcomed the Indigenous-related theme of several of the festivals,  including Merge Ahead at Palmerston festival in the Northern Territory, which also  has a youth focus. 

 “The Emerge festival in Victoria is also engaging with Pacific Islander and North  African communities,” Mr Garrett said.

 “Overall, I’m delighted at the breadth and diversity of the programs.”
