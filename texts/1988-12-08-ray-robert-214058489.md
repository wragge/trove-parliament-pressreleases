 REFUGEE PROGRAM RETAINS HIGH PRIORITY

 Sri

 Australia's proud record in resettling refugees is to  be maintained.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and  Ethnic Affairs,  Senator Robert Ray, said the 1989/90  refugee and humanitarian program would number 14,000.

 "In setting this piogram level, the Government does not  accept the proposal made by the Committee to Advise on  Australia's Immigration Policies (CAAIP) for gradual  disengagement from the Indo-Chinese refugee problem," 

 Senator Ray said.

 "However, in line with the committee's comments, and  recognising the complex issues involved, we will  continue to cooperate with the UNHCR, ASEAN and refugee  resettlement countries, in monitoring the outflow and  trying to find durable solutions.

 "Disengagement is not a solution at present.

 "Australia will play an important role in a major  international conference planned for next year which  will look at this problem.

 "I wish to announce the Government's decision to  establish a permanent position for a Principal Adviser  for Refugees and International Affairs within my  department.

 "The Adviser will put Australia's views on issues,  such  as refugees and population movements, to governments  and international agencies like the UNHCR," the  Minister said.

 He said assessment procedures for people arriving in  Australia and claiming refugee status would be  retained.

 However, the procedures would be strengthened with the  provision of additional resources . ·  ,

 The Government rejected the CAAIP proposal that the  Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) committee, be  replaced by an independent Commissioner to decide  claims.

 The proposed dismantling of the DORS committee would  have seriously affected the Government's ability to  handle the sensitivities so often involved in refugee  cases.

 The confidentiality of information provided to the  Government could also be at risk without the DORS  process.

 "The Government gave careful consideration to the model  proposed by.CAAIP, and a number of other alternatives,"  Senator Ray said.

 "However, it concluded it was more appropriate to  improve the present system and so ensure that people  who seek refugee status in Australia are dealt with  promptly in a fair, humane and comprehensive manner," 

 he said.

 In future, those granted resident status in Australia  under the refugee and humanitarian provisions of the  Act, would be counted as part of the refugee stream of  the migration program.

 In order to avoid an effective reduction in the numbers  of refugees admitted from overseas in 1988-89, the  combined (of f-shore^ and on-shore) program total would  be 12,500. The contingency reserve (which has not  been used since its inception) would thus be 1500.
