 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS  AFFAIRS

 HMAS Canberra To Transfer Unauthorised Boat Arrivals To  Christmas Island

 MPS 44/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, confirmed today that the passengers  aboard the vessel that arrived late yesterday off Port Hedland will be transferred to Christmas Island - an excised offshore  place - pending the consideration of appropriate processing arrangements.

 The vessel is carrying 54 passengers, including 28 adult men, 17 adult women and nine children. It has been suggested that  there is an Australian citizen among the group. Enquiries into the person's status are continuing.

 The Minister said that the vessel needed to be seen in a similar context as the two boats that arrived in Indonesia several  weeks ago. 

 'I do not think this is a major smuggling enterprise of the sort that we were dealing with when large numbers of vessels  arrived,' Mr Ruddock said. 'I see this as more of an opportunistic attempt.'

 The Minister cautioned against pre-judging the status of the passengers. 

 'There is no reason to assume automatically that because people are in a boat in regional waters that they are refugees or in  fact even seeking asylum here.

 'However they will be appropriately interviewed to determine these issues. If they are clearly not asylum seekers, they are  looking for migration outcomes and we would seek to return them quickly. If they are asylum seekers, we would properly test  their claims.'

 Mr Ruddock added that the Opposition spokeswoman had once again shown her lack of experience on these issues in her  attempt to criticise the Government about the facilities on Christmas Island. 

 'Contrary to Ms Gillard's suggestion, the Sports Hall has not be used for some time - there are dedicated facilities on  Christmas Island to deal with these situations that are more than adequate.'

 The Minister said that the arrival of the boat indicated the need for on-going vigilance. 

 'We do not want people simply turning up unannounced with all the risks that that brings which is why we manage the border  control issues very comprehensively.'
