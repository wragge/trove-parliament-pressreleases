 KEVIN RUDD M.P. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 MEDIA RELEASE

 RUDD MEETING WITH UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES

 Shadow Foreign Minister, Kevin Rudd, met yesterday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Rudd Lubbers, in Geneva.

 Mr Rudd said the purpose of his meeting with Mr Lubbers was to obtain a briefing from the UNHCR on its prognosis for the repatriation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran - as well as internally displaced persons within Afghanistan itself.  Altogether these three categories represented some 5.1 - 6.1 million people.

 Mr Rudd said this followed on from his visit to Pakistan and the Pakistan / Afghanistan border in late December.  Following that visit, Mr Rudd prepared a 20-page report on the refugee crisis in Afghanistan, as well as recommendations to the Australian government on how to productively assist the repatriation process.

 Mr Rudd said Mr Lubbers advised that the current spontaneous repatriation rate was running at about 2,500 per week.  This was somewhat in excess of UNHCR expectations.

 Mr Rudd said that Mr Lubbers advised him that the UNHCR was in the process of assisting in planning for large-scale assisted repatriation during 2002 and 2003.

 Of the one million internally displaced persons in Afghanistan at present, it was estimated that 500,000 could be returned to their homes during the current year, and a further 250,000 during 2003.

 As for the 4.1 million refugees in Pakistan and Iran, the UNHCR estimated that 1.5 million could be repatriated by the end of 2003.

 Collectively, this would represent major progress in reducing, albeit not eliminating, the outstanding caseload.

 Mr Lubbers added, however, that the success of the repatriation process was contingent on continued security (including the escalation of the de-mining program) and the effective implementation of the economic reconstruction effort.

 Mr Rudd said that a useful contribution from Australia would be important at next Monday’s UN Donors’ Conference meeting in Tokyo on the humanitarian and reconstruction program for Afghanistan.

 Mr Rudd said it was now almost one month since he had presented Foreign Minister Downer with a detailed report based on the observations of UN agencies in Pakistan working at the coalface.

 Mr Rudd said his recommendations included:

 â¢ Contributing an additional US$2 million to an immediate escalation of the de-mining program; and â¢ An extra US$6.5 million to the UNHCR in order to assist the UNHCR in meeting its emergency appeal targets for the period ahead to facilitate its repatriation efforts.

 Mr Rudd said it was unacceptable that the Howard Government had made budgetary provision for $A23.3 million for emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan back in October last year, but as of today, $A10 million of that amount remained unallocated.

 “It will be of fundamental importance for the Australian government to allocate these funds by next week’s Donors’ conference in Tokyo at the absolute latest,” Mr Rudd said.

 “If Australia is concerned about resolving the problem of illegal international people movements, it must begin immediately to address more robustly the problem at source.”

 “At present, the Howard Government’s efforts are almost exclusively directed at the other end of the chain, where it plans many millions of dollars on the implementation of the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’.”

 “Unless the UNHCR is assisted by the international community, including Australia, to address as a matter of priority the restoration of security and the commencement of economic reconstruction in Afghanistan, the problem at source will not be dealt with, and the probability of the successful repatriation of large numbers of refugees from neighbouring countries and third countries will be radically reduced.”

 “The Howard Government often criticises the UNHCR.  Indeed they have made a habit of doing so.  However, it is important for the Government to recognise that if there was no UNHCR, the problem that we in Australia would face in dealing with a completely uncontrolled environment containing more than 5 million Afghan refugees would obtain massive proportions.”

 Apart from his meeting with Mr Lubbers, the UN High Commissioner, Mr Rudd also met with a range of other UNHCR officials.  He also had a meeting with the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, and discussed the upcoming global human rights agenda for the year ahead.

 Ends Tuesday, 15 January 2002
