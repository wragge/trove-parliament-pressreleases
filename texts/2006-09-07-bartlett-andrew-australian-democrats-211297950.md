 Democrats Introduce Leglislation to End Mandatory Detention

 Democrats Deputy Leader and spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Bartlett has today introduced a  Private Senator's Bill to abolish mandatory detention.    

 The legislation is the seventh in a series of Bills aimed at reforming the Migration Act and removing the  many damaging amendments made to it over the last ten years.   

 "The Democrats were fundamentally opposed to the introduction of mandatory detention back in 1992  when it passed the Senate with the support of both major parties."   

 "Despite the welcome improvements made by the government last year in the face of substantial  community pressure, the provisions requiring mandatory detention still exist in the law."   

 "Australia is the only Western nation that imposes this system of mandatory detention and it has been  directly responsible for enormous and irreparable mental and physical damage to men, women and  children alike."   

 "It is a direct contravention of our obligations under international law and proves that the Government  values its over zealous border control compliance over basic human rights."   

 "We will continue the fight to end detention and other refugee and migration laws and policies that are an  abuse of human rights. We believe the rationale given for detention is flawed and the human and  financial cost unacceptable."   

 "The Democrats have been putting forward alternatives to mandatory detention for some time, based on  models developed by community groups who work with and care for asylum seekers. These models  have been proved to work more effectively, efficiently and cheaply, with far less harm to children and  adults."   

 "It is now time for mandatory detention to be abolished. We call on all parties to support this move to do  so," concluded Senator Bartlett.
