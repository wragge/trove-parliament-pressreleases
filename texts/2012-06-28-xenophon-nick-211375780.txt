 STATEMENT 

 

 Independent Senator for South Australia, Nick Xenophon, will be voting on the asylum seeker  legislation despite the fact he is currently in hospital in Adelaide. (Nick has been in hospital for the  last two-and-a-half weeks with vestibular neuronitis - an inner ear condition that affects balance  and causes severe nausea and precludes travel).   

 While Senator Xenophon will support the Oppositionâs amendments and the Greensâ motion on the  legislation he will ultimately back the Oakeshott bill.   

 “I previously supported onshore processing as a more humane approach to asylum seekers. But to  quote John Maynard Keynes: when the facts change, I change my mind - what do you do?”   

 “The legislation is flawed and the Governmentâs so-called âMalaysia solutionâ highly problematic.  But the alternative - to do nothing - is far worse.”   

 “While I will be supporting the Oppositionâs amendment that countries asylum seekers are sent to  are UN Refugee Convention signatories, the failure of that worthy amendment should not also  mean the bill should fail.”   

 “The Greensâ motion to call for a regional solution and an increase in the refugee intake and  funding is also worthy of support, but if it fails the main bill should not fall over.”   

 “Thereâs a saying âthe perfect should not be the enemy of the goodâ. This bill is a Hobsonâs choice.  In this case, the imperfect should be the enemy of the bad - the evil trade in people smuggling.”
