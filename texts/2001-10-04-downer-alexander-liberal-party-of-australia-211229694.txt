  MEDIA RELEASE  M I N I S T E R  FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  A L E X A N D E R  D O W N E R  

  FURTHER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH WEST ASIA 

  AA 01 021 4 October 2001 

  Following ongoing assessment of the situation in South West Asia, Australia will commit a fbrther  $9 million towards the delivery of humanitarian assistance to displaced and refugee populations in  South West Asia. This fbnding is additional to the initial $14.3 million I announced on 23 September. 

  This commitment is a result of the deepening crisis as people movements increase across the region.  Latest reports indicate there are between five and six million vulnerable people inside Afghanistan and  this is in addition to 3.5 million Afghan refugees already living in Iran and Pakistan. In recent weeks it  is reported that approximately 20,000 Afghans entered Pakistan. 

  My announcement today includes a number of initiatives, ranging fiom support for Australian Non  Government Organisations (NGOs) providing emergency assistance, support for international aid  agencies and the purchase and delivery of Australian commodities to help feed displaced people. 

  Emergency food supplies will remain an urgent priority over coming months in Afghanistan and  surrounding countries. The Australian Government will assist by purchasing 7,200 tomes of  Australian grown and milled wheat-flour, valued at approximately $5 million. 

  Australian NGOs can offer considerable support at the community level in the current crisis and,  accordingly, I have decided to make available $1 million to assist the operations of Australian NGOs  contributing to the overall humanitarian response for Afghanistan. The $1 million is to be distributed  equally between Australian Red Cross, Care Australia, Oxfam Community Aid Abroad and UNICEF  Australia. 

  The third component of today’s announcement of $9 million is the allocation of funds to those  international agencies best placed to deliver effective humanitarian relief in the region at this point in  time. $500,000 will assist the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  (OCHA) to perform the critical task of coordinating humanitarian activities across the region; 

  $2 million will be allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which is  delivering food, medicines and emergency medical facilities both inside Afghanistan and in  neighbouring countries, and a fbrther $500,000 will go to the International Organisation for Migration  which is providing tents, blankets, cooking utensils and warm clothing for vulnerable children inside 

  Afghanistan and across South West Asia. 

  I am keen to see Australia play an active role in this major humanitarian crisis and have dispatched  several senior officials overseas to work closely with the various international agencies coordinating  relief efforts. These initiatives demonstrate Australia’s continuing commitment to supporting  refbgees, internally displaced people and other vulnerable groups, bringing Australia’s contributions 

  since the crisis began to $23.3 million.
