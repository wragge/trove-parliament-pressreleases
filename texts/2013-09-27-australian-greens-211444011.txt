 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 27 September 2013   

 Pass the diplomatic ointment for Abbott’s “asylum irritant”   

 The Greens have slammed the Coalition’s complete disregard of Indonesia’s  growing concerns about Tony Abbott’s asylum policy.   

 “Mr Abbott continues to show contempt to Indonesia by thinking he can swat  away their concerns as if they were an irritating mosquito,” Greens  immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “We predicted ahead of the election that Mr Abbott would embarrass  Australia on the world stage, and his latest comments on Indonesia are further  proof.   

 “We need to work with Indonesia to achieve a genuine regional approach  where vulnerable refugees aren’t exploited in the process, but unfortunately  that isn’t on Mr Abbott’s agenda. His disrespect for our neighbours is only  matched by his cruelty to refugees.   

 “The Government must clarify whether reports today that a group of asylum  seekers were taken back to Indonesia after their boat got in trouble signals the  beginning of Abbott's dangerous turn back policy.   

 “Foreign officials, experienced defence force personnel, and the UN refugee  body have all slammed turning back the boats, only the Coalition thinks this is  a good idea.”
