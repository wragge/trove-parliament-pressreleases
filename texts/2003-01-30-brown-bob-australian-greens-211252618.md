 Brown Welcomes Hanna   

 Greens Senator Bob Brown says South Australian state MP Kris Hanna has shown  great political courage in leaving the Labor Party.    

 “However it is the right decision,” Senator Brown said.    

 “Mr Hanna is a rare politician prepared to endure turmoil to foster his convictions on  social justice, in particular the need for action against the appalling treatment of  refugees in Australia’s infamous internment centres.    

 “I’ve had good discussions with Kris. He is a man of strong principle and knows he  will cop flak for it but, while still young, wants the freedom to express views different  to those of the ALP hierarchy. He’s very welcome to the growing Greens.    

 “The Greens state conference will discuss his application to join on Saturday but the  feedback I have had is very positive. This is an exciting day for the Greens too,”  Senator Brown said.
