 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 NO SEX DISCRIMINATION ACT EXEMPTION FOR DETENTION

 Labor welcomes the announcement by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward and Human Rights Commissioner Sev Ozdowski that they will soon visit Woomera to see for themselves how successful the alternative detention trial for women and children has been.

 Since August 2001 when the trial began, the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) has had a temporary exemption from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the trial to exclude men and boys aged thirteen and over.

 There is no justification for DIMIA’s application for a continuing exemption.  Labor again calls upon the Minister to accept the recommendations of his own Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG) that the trial be expanded to family groups.

 The amendment I recently moved to the Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill - to be debated in the Parliament next month - seeks to modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that children cannot be held in high security detention for long periods of time. This amendment will compel the Government to:

 â¢ Put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements; and â¢ Allow families with children to live in accommodation like the Woomera alternate detention trial.

 It is vital that Ms Goward and Dr Ozdowski not grant a continuing exemption to the Department, an exemption which has the effect of allowing the Government to keep families apart.
