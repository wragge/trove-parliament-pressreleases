 TIME FOR SOME TRUTH INSTEAD OF SCAREMONGERING ON BORDER PROTECTION

 The Australian Democrats say recent Government allegations about a new people smuggling ring targetting the Torres Strait raise more questions than answers regarding the integrity of the Minister and the Australian Government.

 “There are three obvious questions that come to mind,” Australian Democrats Spokesperson for Immigration Senator Andrew Bartlett said.

 “The first is how is it that the government can know so much about a clandestine operation like this but failed to notice three hundred people drowning in the middle of one of the most intense surveillance operations in our history?”

 “Also, if people are aiming for Torres Strait, why would they not just as readily target the mainland?”

 “Another unanswered question is why is the Minister failing to address the issue at its source?”

 Senator Bartlett said, “It really is time the media stopped swallowing the lines of the Immigration Minister in relation to people smugglers and challenged him to stop people smuggling at its source.”

 “These claims of  ‘floods of refugees’ heading for the Torres Strait simply demonstrate that the Government has failed to address people smuggling at the source.”

 “It is obvious that what is needed is for the Minister to act upon his stated intent to take offshore refugees and begin accepting people from Nauru, Manus Island and Indonesia.”

 “The Minister continually makes the false statement that Australia is upholding its obligations under the Refugee Convention,” Senator Bartlett said.  “However the Refugee Convention is very clear about not punishing people for their method of arrival. “

 “The Pacific solution’s strategy is one of deter and deny - the intention is to not under any circumstances allow people to engage our obligations.  It is an approach which avoids our obligations, not upholds them.”

 “There are thousands of people in Indonesia who have been assessed as refugees by the UNHCR.  In some cases Australia is paying for their upkeep whilst they wait for a country to offer them a permanent solution.”

 “Instead of respecting the process put in place by the United Nations, Australia has refused to accept any under the humanitarian program. The Minister is talking about thousands of people desperate enough to pay criminals and face death on crowded fishing boats yet the number of people we have taken officially from Indonesia during the last year is less than 20.

 “These are not illegal immigrants sitting in Indonesia.  They have been declared refugees by the UNHCR and continue to languish in Indonesia in desperate circumstances whilst the government insists on misleading Australian people about the truth.”
