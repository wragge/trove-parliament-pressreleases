 RECORD COMMONWEALTH INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING 14 May 2002  MIN 63/02

 The Howard Government’s seventh Budget provides a record $64 billion over the next four years to continue its commitment to the vital education, science and training sectors which underpin so much of Australia’s future success and prosperity.

 Portfolio funding in 2002-03 totals more than $14.7 billion, an increase of 6.9% over the amount available for these sectors in the previous year.

 SCHOOLS

 Historically, school funding is largely the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. However, Commonwealth funding for Australia’s schools has risen significantly since 1996. Over the four years to 2005-06 Commonwealth expenditure will total $29.3 billion. The 2002-03 allocation of $6.6 billion represents a 6.5% increase on the previous year, continuing the trend of increased investment in education each year.

 Commonwealth funding to Government schools will increase by 5.7% on the previous year, representing a 52% increase since 1996. During this period, Government school enrolments have increased by 1.4%.

 The Howard Government is continuing its drive to boost the framework for quality results and improve outcomes for all students.

 Commonwealth funding for all schools is focussed on achieving agreed national standards, particularly for literacy and numeracy. It encourages schools to provide comprehensive reports to parents about their children’s progress in these priority areas.

 Children will be assisted to achieve their potential with a further injection of $82.4 million over three years to expand the already successful Quality Teacher Programme.

 The programme will lift the quality of teaching through targeted professional development and improve teachers’ access to the latest subject knowledge and classroom techniques. The additional funds mean the programme will continue until 2004-05, bringing the total committed to the programme since 1999-2000 to $159.2 million.

 I am confident that teachers in primary and secondary schools throughout Australia will continue to benefit from this world class programme. This means better educated children with brighter prospects.

 Education is the key to the future for disadvantaged Australians. In particular, I am determined that our efforts to improve the education outcomes for Indigenous students will continue to be a priority. We will provide $445 million in 2002-03 to enhance the outcomes of indigenous students in schooling, training and higher education.

 Additional funding of $67.2 million is being made available for new school students arriving in Australia following the Government’s decision to increase the permanent migration intake in 2002-2003. This measure will provide for:

 The English as a Second Language (ESL) New Arrivals Programme and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The General Recurrent Grants âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government has also decided to provide funding of $14.3 million over four years to extend access to the English as a Second Language New Arrivals Programme, to minors who hold temporary visas in the humanitarian and refugee arrivals category.

 SCIENCE

 The Commonwealth has committed $5.1 billion in support of to science and innovation in 2002-03, an increase of 5.8% on the previous year. It’s the highest amount ever spent by the Commonwealth on supporting science and technology.

 Following on from a $405 million funding boost last year , this year’s boost of $281 million reflects the Government’s commitment to press ahead with vital work under the $3 billion Backing Australia’s Ability initiative.

 The Government’s continuing commitment to world class research is highlighted by the foreshadowed 32% increase in funds for the Australian Research Council. An additional $85 million will be made available in 2002-03, bringing total funding to $356 million under Backing Australia’s Ability.

 The Government will boost university infrastructure by $55 million in the first round of funding in order to support our best researchers: the Research Infrastructure Block Grants scheme will be increased by $23 million and $27 million will be provided through the Systemic Infrastructure Initiative for a first round of funding to upgrade university libraries, laboratories and other research infrastructure.

 The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) will receive $286 million, which

 includes capital funding of $104 million for the construction of the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency recently signed a construction licence for this major addition to Australia’s scientific infrastructure.

 Two radioactive waste management facilities will be established with funding totalling $9.9  million. The funding, over three years from 1 July 2002 , will establish a repository for the safe disposal of low-level waste and a national store for above-ground storage of intermediate level waste. The facilities will manage the waste from the existing Lucas Heights reactor and the replacement research reactor which is expected to be constructed by 2004-05, as well as waste from medical, industrial and research activities.

 The range of Government spending across all portfolios will generate ideas, stimulate creative research, produce the skilled people and provide the infrastructure necessary to build our strength as an innovative nation.

 TRAINING

 Vital training initiatives for all Australians will be supported by $8 billion of Commonwealth funds over the four years to 2005-06. In 2002-03 funding will total $1.9 billion, an increase of 5.5% over the previous year’s figure, including $1.1 billion to the States and Territories through the Australian National Training Authority.

 The Government will continue its support for the successful New Apprenticeships programme. The Budget commits additional funds to encourage high tech employers to take on New Apprentices. It also supports those employers who take on young people while they are still at school.

 The Innovation New Apprenticeships  measure means employers taking on a New Apprentice in IT or other emerging high skill occupations will be eligible for an additional $1,100 incentive payment.

 Employers who take on a New Apprentice while the young person is still at school will be eligible for an incentive payment of $750. They will be eligible for a further $750 if they continue to employ the young person as a New Apprentice within six months of them completing year 12.

 Together, these two measures are worth more than $54 million over four years.

 Older people looking for a job will welcome the Government’s commitment to ensuring they too have the chance to get vital IT skills.

 The Budget provides $23 million over four years to assist up to 46,000 people aged 45 years and over who are in the labour force or are welfare dependent but have no previous post-school qualifications in IT.

 I know from the feedback I get that there are many older people who will jump at the opportunity this innovative measure will provide. IT skills are a key to so many jobs today, but it has been older people on lower incomes who have frequently missed out on these opportunities to date.

 This measure will offer training valued at up to $500 to help this group acquire skills such as how to turn on a

 computer, send an e-mail and access the Internet.

 The Budget also provides additional training assistance for people with disabilities under changes to the Disability Support Pension (DSP). More than 3,200 extra training places over three years will be available for people with disabilities to improve their work capacity to enable them to make the transition from the DSP to the workforce.

 The funding of $35.7 million over three years, starting in 2003-04, will provide funding to the States and Territories for mainstream Vocational Education and Training, and additional funding for the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Programme.

 The Commonwealth will reduce funding to the States and Territories for Industry Training Advisory Bodies (ITABs). These bureaucratic arrangements, which have become increasingly complex, need to be streamlined. I have asked my Department to oversee consultations with key industry stakeholders on improved arrangements.

 HIGHER EDUCATION

 Funding for higher education will total $20.6 billion over four years. The allocation for 2002-03 of $4.9 billion, represents an increase of 5.8% over the previous year. With the inclusion of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS), this brings the total contribution for 2002-03 to $6.2 billion.

 The well received Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) will be extended to four additional institutions - Bond University in Queensland; Melbourne College of Divinity; the Christian Heritage College in Queensland and Tabor College in South Australia. PELS allows eligible students in fee paying post-graduate non-research courses to get a loan from the Commonwealth for part or all of their tuition fees.

 The extension of PELS from January 2003 is estimated to result in 2,000 more students taking out loans worth approximately $18.7 million over the following four years. This will help increase student choice and access to higher education.

 The Budget also provides $300,000 to establish a new Graduate Diploma in Environment and Planning at the University of Tasmania. The three year course, which will start in 2002-03, will be further boosted by six Commonwealth scholarships worth $10,000 each.

 Another Budget measure provides $100,000 for a review of rural veterinary services in 2002-03. The review will focus particularly on supply of veterinary services in rural and regional Australia.

 Seed funding of $250,000 for 2001-02 is also provided to establish the General Sir John Monash Awards to allow postgraduate Australian students to study at leading North American and European universities. The Awards will also allow foreign postgraduates to study in Australia.

 The Commonwealth will work with States to streamline and strengthen the Commonwealth-State administrative arrangements for sharing the costs of university superannuation liabilities for some present and past staff, who are members of State emerging cost superannuation

 schemes.

 This review of superannuation arrangements will complement the higher education policy review currently being undertaken, in seeking to reduce red tape for universities, improving financial management and streamlining administrative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States.

 The kind of Australia in which the next generation will live, to a large extent will depend on Australia’s institution of higher learning - universities. Their success in no small way will determine the kind of country in which Australians will be living 25 years from now. For that reason, over the next nine months, I will be conducting a review of the policy options for administering, supporting and funding Australian universities.
