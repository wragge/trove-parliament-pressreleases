 Australia to Fully Fund UNHCR Project in Afghanistan

 VPS 057/2004

 Australia will play a leading role in funding International efforts to assist Afghan refugees and internally  displaced people in Afghanistan return home by providing $4.66 million in funding to the Office of the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

 I was glad that I could personally inform the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Ruud  Lubbers of the funding for this project during my meeting with him today.

 Returning Afghan refugees will be provided with repatriation assistance, basic shelter and income generation  schemes for Afghans wishing to return to Afghanistan as part of the UNHCR's general repatriation program. 

 Internally displaced Afghans will also be assisted by the project and additional support will be provided for  the return of Afghans from Iran and Pakistan. The repatriation assistance component of the project will benefit  an estimated 100 000 returnees from Pakistan and Iran.

 Shelter will be provided for 1 000 families or approximately 8 000 people and the most disadvantaged people  will also receive income generation support.

 The UNHCR has assisted in the return of over 2.5 million Afghanis return to their homeland. In 2004, an  estimated 480 000 Afghans are expected to return to the Western and Central regions of Afghanistan.

 By supporting both the return process and initial reintegration efforts, the project aims to ensure that return to  Afghanistan is sustainable. It will also help promote further international support for UNHCR assistance for  Afghan asylum seekers. 

 Indeed this latest funding commitment is further demonstration of the Australian Government's generous  support and continuous assistance towards the reconstruction and capacity building of Afghanistan.

 The funding is in addition to the $12.6 million provided to the UNHCR for its annual program budget and  through AusAID's International Refugee Fund.
