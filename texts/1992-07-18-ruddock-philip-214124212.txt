 2 +  2 =  3

 2+2=3, or so Minister for Immigration Gerry Hand would have us believe.

 Only a Minister excusing his own incompetence in controlling illegal entry would argue,  on the one hand that the numbers of illegal entrants has fallen, while at the same time  threatening new and draconian legislation.

 However, if one reads through the fine print, the new legislation is in fact no more than  the present arrangements for illegal entrants to be taken into custody when apprehended.  What will be new are provisions to allow release from custody while making further 

 applications for grant of permanent residence or to pursue refugee claims.

 The Minister has also appeared to ignore frequent suggestions from the Opposition in  relation to cutting off income support for illegal entrants and imposing sanctions on  employers who knowingly engage illegal entrants. This can easily be addressed by  ensuring that they do not have access to tax file numbers.

 The issue of illegal workers cannot be addressed while the Government still issues this  kind of authority to work and the Minister's resistance to this suggestion cannot be  adequately explained.

 In relation to the number of illegals currently in Australia, the numbers have in fact gone  up, notwithstanding additional resources in the compliance area.

 The Minister has claimed that a figure of 81,500 overstayers, even though this represents  an overall increase in numbers from last year, is not too bad since there has been an  increase in the number of travellers to Australia. -

 The Minister however provides us with a clue that statistics in this area are notoriously  unreliable.

 He admits that the reduction in numbers is, in part a result of overstayers regularising  their status. This correlates with the significant increase in the processing backlog for  change of status applications, and the high number of on-shore approvals for grant of  residence (17,485 last financial year).

 The numbers of illegals are still probably grossly understated.

 - There are still a large number of PRC nationals on temporary entry 

 permits who would otherwise have been classified as illegal.

 - there are still a large number of applicants seeking asylum, many of whom  would also be otherwise classified as illegal.

 - there are still a large number of applications for grant of residence on  shore who would otherwise be illegal.

 Despite the Minister's boasts about tough and draconian legislation to control illegal  entry, we are still faced with a significant, and largely unaddressed problem.
