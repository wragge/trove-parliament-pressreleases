 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Ansett, Refugees, Footy Predictions

 Transcript - Parliament House, Canberra - 27 September 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: This is a fix for an election, but it's not a fix for Christmas. There's no permanent solution here. What is required is that the Government sits down with the administrator and gets a position together whereby Ansett is up and flying properly. This is a fix for the capital cities, but it's not a fix for our tourist destinations. As a fix for the capital cities, it's a very limited one indeed.

 We need a Government engaged. After two weeks of abusing us for suggesting that they should be engaged, they put a toe in the water. They've got to do more than this if we are to get jobs back, if we're going to get the tourism industry up and running again, and if we're going to get decent competition in the aviation industry.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the figures involved here, what they're prepared to underwrite, how does that match up against what Labor has been calling for?

 BEAZLEY: Take a look at what is up there. It is a very limited fix - a very limited fix that lasts for a limited period of time. But it certainly doesn't look as though those estimates that they placed on our view about what it would take for a temporary fix, while a decent decision was worked through, was anything remotely accurate. As I remember what John Howard said, it was about $100 million a day. Recollect that he had that view that when I asked for $100 million to keep the airline going for a couple of weeks, he said it would be $170 million a day. I suspect he was wrong. I suspect that what this shows is that he was wrong. That's not the point any more. The point is now how do we get a permanent fix in place. It's just too cynical to have a fix for an election, but not for Christmas, and not a long-term solution.

 JOURNALIST: But under this plan, hasn't the Government effectively minimised taxpayers' exposure with planes back in the sky?

 BEAZLEY: The whole point here is to get a reconstruction of the essence of our aviation system. That's what you've got to do. I don't think people who live in Canberra really fully comprehend what this means the further you get away from Sydney. The further you get away from Sydney, the less of a fix this is. We absolutely require, if we're going to get decent airfares, if we're going to get decent job opportunities, if we're going to get the tourism industry up and running, we require a permanent fix to the Ansett

 situation. That's necessary. It has to be done. The Government has said it's not their business. At least what the Government has done now is shown that they finally understand that it is their business. I made a promise to the Ansett workers that I would batter away at this Government for two weeks in Parliament until this Government began to face up to its responsibilities. I've got to say I've had some success, but it's limited success. We need more.

 JOURNALIST: Should the unions also face up to their responsibilities and make those productivity gains needed?

 BEAZLEY: The unions were always prepared to talk to whoever would be the new owners of, or the operators of Ansett, always prepared to talk about those issues. That's never been in doubt, never been in question. The people who have been actually battling to get Ansett up, that is, doing the job the Government should be doing - talking to the administrator, getting in place a solution that doesn't leave Ansett as a carcass, as was described by the Deputy Prime Minister last weekend, a carcass was how he described it, and the whole tragedy, 'a little blip', by the Tourism Minister - the unions have been battling to get the Government to face its responsibilities. It has actually been quite a noble hour for the union movement. It's about time people started to look at who was accepting responsibility in this country. The people who are not accepting responsibility, until dragged kicking and screaming to it, is the Government.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, was Paul Keating right when he says Australia's rejection of Afghan boatpeople is ludicrous?

 BEAZLEY: I haven't seen those comments from Paul. We have a humanitarian program, a refugee program, that accepts refugees from all parties of the world. Among those refugees, within the ceiling that we accept, should be people from Afghanistan. No question about that.

 JOURNALIST: …extend the humanitarian intake, should that be increased?

 BEAZLEY: We have a sizeable humanitarian intake. I think that it is the largest, or the second largest of all those who sign up to the UNHCR program. It is capable of being rebalanced internally to deal with problems that are emerging around the place. Sometimes it means, of course, that it's readjusted to take into account the fact that there may be an emerging situation in an area and people are dropped out of the list from other areas of the globe. That would be an entirely appropriate response in this instance.

 JOURNALIST: But similar to the Kosovo response and the Timor response, where we took under an international crisis situation a temporary number or asylum seekers. Should that be the case with Afghanistan?

 BEAZLEY: Let's see what develops now. Let's see what emerges from this. Certainly, the UN is going to need a great deal of assistance from counties like Australia to ensure that the people who are scattered by the crisis that's emerging in Afghanistan are properly looked after.

 JOURNALIST: Just back on Ansett, if you are Prime Minister in 12 weeks when this current arrangement expires, would you extend it?

 BEAZLEY: If I'm Prime Minister in 12 weeks, I'll be going for a permanent fix. But I've got to say this, if nothing happens in the next 12 weeks to product a permanent fix, I think the show will be in a deal of trouble, frankly. I think things have to happen right now. I think what we actually have to do, the Prime

 Minister has to do, and the Deputy Prime Minister has to do, is now, having got the sort of temporary solution that should have been there on day one two weeks ago, they now move on to a permanent solution that should be put in place well before Christmas and well before an election.

 JOURNALIST: But if capacity is back to 90 per cent at the moment and these 11 aircraft take it up towards 100, what would be wrong with extending that, maintaining 100 per cent indefinitely?

 BEAZLEY: Don't kid yourself about that question of capacity. That is a very moveable feast. That is a very self-serving calculation, frankly, a very self-serving calculation indeed. Go and tell that to the people who live in Townsville, in Cairns. Go and tell it to the people who live in Adelaide, or in Perth and see how they go on accessing flights and seats and the price at which they access it. Don't kid yourself for one minute that that is what is happening here. We need a permanent fix. Frankly, I think it would be a tragedy if, when I become Prime Minister a couple of months from now, we don't actually have a permanent solution in place. We now have the breathing space that we should have had two weeks ago, if the Prime Minister had listened to me, we'd have had two weeks ago. That was an anticipation that once you got that breathing space for a couple of weeks, you get a permanent solution from that point on.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, is today the last day of Parliament for this Government? And is Labor ready to go?

 BEAZLEY: Yes, we're ready to go. We've been ready to go to the polls, really, any time in the last 18 months. If you're a wise Opposition you always get yourself into that situation. Our basic policy is out there. Of course, circumstances change, new issues emerge, issues that may not have been at the forefront of your thinking in an election campaign, say, 12 months ago are now obviously significant now. The security at home and security abroad that people need was not necessarily a theme that would have been there 12 months ago. But it's absolutely on target for what we need now, what sort of policies are needed now in this changed international environment.

 JOURNALIST: What's your advice to backbenchers as they head out to their electorates?

 BEAZLEY: Fight hard. All of us in politics, when an election campaign comes around, and you stand for what's happening, you stand for a decent opportunity for ordinary Australian families, when you take a stand for ensuring the security of our nation, security of our families, decent living standards for the elderly, decent education opportunity, a fair health system, when you're taking a stand for those issues, you are in the battle zone of Australian politics. It's never easy to get those messages up. But it is absolutely essential for the majority of the population. It is a policy for ordinary Australians - not for elites. When you're on the side of ordinary Australians, you don't necessarily find it easy to get your messages across. We've got a battle ahead of us, and they're ready for it.

 JOURNALIST: Bob Brown says Labor is now a right wing party. Is that a fair description?

 BEAZLEY: Well, Bob Brown says that on an annual basis.

 JOURNALIST: What are your tips for the footy?

 BEAZLEY: Brisbane and the Knights.
