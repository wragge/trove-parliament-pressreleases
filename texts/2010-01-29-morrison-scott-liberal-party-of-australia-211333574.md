 CHRISTMAS ISLAND A VISA FACTORY FOR PEOPLE SMUGGLERS 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The Rudd Labor Government’s failed border protection policies and the special deal done with the passengers 

 who held the Oceanic Viking to ransom, are responsible for the tensions now arising in the Christmas Island 

 detention centre, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 “Senator Evans claims that the reason for the delays in processing the Tamils on Christmas Island is the result of 

 delays in providing security clearances,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “If that is the case, what shortcuts in security checking were made to process those on the Oceanic Viking in as 

 little as six weeks?” he said.  

 “With the population of the centre at unsustainable levels already and new boats arriving every week, the 

 Government is now reeling from the consequences of their own weak policies.  

 “The Government is making a difficult situation even worse with soft policies and weak decisions.  

 “The most important priority of the Rudd Labor Government should be stopping the boats and reinstating the 

 Coalition’s strong border protection measures - measures they systematically unwound since November 2007.  

 “The population of the detention centre has increased ten fold since the latter half of last year and the boats are 

 still coming, encouraged by the policies of the Rudd Labor Government and people smugglers.  

 “Nearly everyone in the detention centre has paid a people smuggler. More than 9 of every 10 applicants get a 

 visa. Christmas Island has simply become a visa factory for people
