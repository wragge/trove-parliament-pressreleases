 Senator Brian Greig Senator for Western Australia

 Press Release Dated: 11 Jun 2000 Press Release Number: 00/341 Portfolio: Environment Related: Forestry and Conservation

 Western Australians not Conservative : Democrats Results from a Democrats survey released today reveal that Western Australians are environmentally and socially aware and very concerned about what is happening around them.

 Democrats Senator for Western Australia, Senator Brian Greig says his recent survey of 1200 randomly chosen Western Australians, shows that 91 per cent believe Australia should set targets for the control of greenhouse emissions and 82 per cent are concerned about electromagnetic emissions from mobile phones.

 "The survey of residents right across the metropolitan area, shows that Western Australians are not complacent about their environment and are very concerned about what we eat and how safe we are from pollution," Senator Greig said.

 "Politicians often under-estimate the electorate and think it is apathetic when it comes to social and environmental policy. I was very pleased to be able to prove that assumption wrong."
