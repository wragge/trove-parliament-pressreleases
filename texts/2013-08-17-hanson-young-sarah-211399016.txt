 Chaotic and cruel PNG deal unravelling   

 Kevin Rudd was so keen to look tough on refugees that he ignored the cruelty and the impracticality  of the PNG deal, as revealed by that country’s Prime Minister today, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Kevin Rudd’s chaotic rush to refugee cruelty is unravelling as the details of the deal with PNG  emerge,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the cruel PNG deal is not only inhumane, but also impractical.   

 “The government’s eagerness to beat up on refugees is matched only by Tony Abbott’s desperation  to win the race to the bottom.   

 “Australia is a bighearted country with a genuine commitment to giving people a fair-go. It’s sad to  see that our nation’s generous heart is under attack as the old parties rush to the polls on the back  of refugee cruelty.   

 “The Greens are a sole voice in the Australian Parliament, standing up for vulnerable people and  putting forward a genuine regional solution that would save lives at sea while caring for refugees.”
