 Greens welcome High Commissioner’s condemnation of Malaysian human swap  

 The Greens applaud comments from the UN’S High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi  Pillay, that Australia proposed human swap with Malaysia may violate international law. 

 Commissioner Pillay also criticised mandatory detention and the delays in processing  applications by asylum seekers. 

 “The Australian Greens have long-argued that the way the Australian government treats  asylum seekers is inhumane and violates international law - points which have been  supported by Commissioner Pillay,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today. 

 “We’re pleased too that Commissioner Pillay has queried the alleged human swap deal with  Malaysia that requires 800 people to risk their lives on boats to try reaching Australia before  we receive 4,000 assessed refugees from Malaysia. 

 “Our position, that Australia should not be sending people to a country which has not ratified  the convention on torture and has not ratified the Refugee Convention, has been backed by  the Commissioner. 

 “The Commissioner also said Australia should be expediting applications of asylum seekers  and also not waste huge amounts of money on detention centres and sending people abroad. 

 “The Greens are the only party highlighting the $1 billion to be spent this year alone on  detention centres is a waste of money when we know community detention is a far cheaper  and humane alternative, and would diminish the likelihood of people self-destructing while  waiting for their claim to be assessed.”
