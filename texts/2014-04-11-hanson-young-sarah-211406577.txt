 Greens: Tamil man’s self-harm a tragedy    

 The Australian Greens have expressed their sympathies for a young Tamil man, his family and his  friends, after he resorted to serious self-harm when he was denied protection earlier this week.    

 “My thoughts go out to this young man, and to his family and friends, in what must be an  unbelievably difficult time for them,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “I am calling on the Australian Government to allow this man’s elderly mother to come to Australia.  His friends are at his bedside and she should be there too.    

 “This tragic event shows the suffering and the fear that the Government’s policies are forcing people  to endure.    

 “There are thousands of other Tamil refugees in the community who are facing the threat of being  returned to Sri Lanka.    

 “The Australian Government must recognise the significant record of serious human rights abuses  that take place in Sri Lanka, especially against the persecuted Tamil minority.”
