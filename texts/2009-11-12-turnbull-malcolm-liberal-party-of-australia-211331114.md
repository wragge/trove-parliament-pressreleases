 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION ADDRESS TO THE LIBERAL PARTY  VICTORIA DIVISION 150TH STATE COUNCIL - 7 NOVEMBER 2009 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 Well thank you Kevin. It is wonderful to be here in Geelong with you and my many other federal parliamentary 

 colleagues, with Ted and his state parliamentary colleagues, with David Kemp, your President and the members 

 of the Liberal Party Victoria.  

 Can I say at the outset how impressed I am and how grateful I am for the leadership you in Victoria have shown 

 in the process of party renewal. The infusion of new talent that we will take to the election from this state 

 demonstrates to anyone who would doubt it, the vibrancy and the vigour, the capacity, the energy and the 

 enterprise of our great party.  

 Now you’ve already heard this morning from our candidate, and I trust the next federal member for this seat, 

 Corangamite, Sarah Henderson. Sarah first came to our attention of course as a prominent broadcasting 

 journalist, serving for a time as the Victorian anchor for the 7.30 Report and also as a columnist for the Herald 

 Sun.  

 She has practised law in New York, she has run her own business, yet no matter how glittering her career has 

 been in business, media or the law, from one end of the world to the other, her heart has always been right here, 

 right here in Geelong. She has returned to the place she knows and loves. She is a lawyer, self employed, a 

 mother, a local, and she is making her mission in life to represent the interests of this community, the Bellarine 

 Peninsula, the surf coast, the whole community of Corangamite. I have campaigned with Sarah here and I know 

 that with the support of the whole Liberal family here - and I see Senator Ronaldson who has taken her under his 

 wings, working particularly hard to support her here - I know that Sarah is going to be the next federal member 

 for Corangamite.  

 And of course the recent triumph at the MCG, I’m sure was closely connected to…the spiritual guidance that 

 Sarah has been giving….the additional guidance she’s been giving…and in addition to Ted’s of course, to the 

 team.  

 Now the Victorian division has pre-selected some remarkable new candidates. I’ve talked about Sarah 

 appropriately, first and foremost as we’re here in Geelong. Yesterday I was out campaigning with Kelly O’Dwyer 

 in Higgins. Now Kelly is not here today, quite rightly, she recognises that the top priority in her life between now 

 and the 5th of December is to get elected and so she is out on the hustings in Higgins. And again, another young 

 woman, professional, came into public life with a strong background in law, she served as a senior adviser to our 

 greatest treasurer Peter Costello, and of course her predecessor in Higgins, she has worked in business, in 

 government, she is a worthy representative of all of the values we hold dear.  

 Yesterday Kelly and I met small business leaders in Malvern, right in the heart of her electorate, just around the 

 corner from her campaign office and you could see there that she is connecting with the grass roots, the small 

 business base in that electorate, in a way that all good Liberal candidates should and do. And again credit to you, 

 the Victorian division for pre-selecting her.  

 Can I also mention the new candidate for Wannon, Dan Tehan, another young candidate; Dan as you know was 

 the deputy state director for the Liberal Party here in Victoria. He is held in very high regard by all of us as a very 

 talented political strategist. He is a country boy at heart. He knows what matters most to the people of rural and 

 regional Australia and he brings a wide range of skills and insights and experience to the policy debates. He will 

 be a champion for the interests of western Victoria and a strong and effective voice for rural and regional 

 communities, that particularly now under a Labor Government that has no interest, no concern for rural and 

 regional Australia. He will be a particularly effective voice taking the fight up to Labor.  

 Now in addition to those great new candidates, of course we have Josh Frydenberg who will be the candidate in 

 Kooyong, succeeding Petro. Josh gave up, as they say, a promising career on the tennis court to graduate with 

 Honours in law and economics. He has worked in commercial law, he has worked in banking, he has worked in 

 government, he has been an adviser to Daryl Williams, Attorney-General, to Alex Downer, Foreign Minister and 

 ultimately in the office of John Howard. He has a broad range of experience and he again brings to this task a 

 youth and a vigour and an expertise that gives considerable credit to the Liberal Party, particularly the Victorian 

 division.  

 And of course in addition those young candidates we have Alan Tudge, another outstanding new candidate that 

 you have brought in to succeed Chris Pearce in Aston. Alan is also a graduate in arts and law. He has also got a 

 business background. He has an MBA from Harvard. He served as a….worked on indigenous affairs as a deputy 

 director of the Cape York Institute, working with Noel Pearson. So he’s not just somebody who has come from 

 the business and legal world. He has got a really grassroots experience working with some of the most 

 disadvantaged communities in Australia. He has obviously worked as an adviser in government and again brings 

 that total package of skills together to be part of our new Liberal team here in Victoria.  

 And I should also of course pay tribute to a somewhat older but very experienced candidate, the comeback kid 

 Phil Barresi who is running again in the seat of Deakin which he served so well for so many years. Again I have 

 campaigned with Phil in Deakin recently and I can see that the people there are very keen to get him back. We 

 want Phil back in parliament and so do they.  

 So this emergence of these new stars and of course with the redoubtable comeback kid Phil Barresi as well, is a 

 great credit to your party - and David I just want to say to you again as your federal Leader, your national Leader 

 of the Liberal Party, thank you, thank you for the leadership you’ve shown, the reforms you’ve undertaken and 

 they have borne fruit in the outstanding candidates you are bringing to the federal election next year. So thank 

 you on behalf of the whole party.  

 Now Kevin spoke earlier about the Rudd Government going around and around in the circles in Canberra. The 

 Rudd Government is finally being caught up for being a party of spin as opposed to substance. Its rhetoric is 

 finally being shown up for what it is; just talk. And this is right across the board. We have been very focused for 

 the last few weeks on the issue of border protection - and so we should.  

 Let’s be quite clear about this. We are witnessing at the moment, every day, every night on our television news 

 programs, we are witnessing evidence of one of the most colossal policy failures in recent times. This is a 

 Government that said it could unpick the policy fabric, the border protection policy fabric of the Howard 

 Government that it was left with when it came into office; a policy that was working in the sense that there were 

 little or no boat arrivals. The people smugglers were basically out of business. They had taken Australia off their 

 list; they were presumably setting their sights somewhere else. So the people smuggling issue had been not 

 entirely put to rest - it would never be entirely put to rest - but it had been reduced to nil or negligible levels. And 

 that was the result of years of hard work of policies which were developed, some were inherited from Labor of 

 course, and they were refined and changed. Kevin Rudd makes the point, he says; the Howard Government put 

 women and children behind bars and razor wire. Let’s be quite clear about this; women and children were put in 

 detention, along with the whole families, that was a policy of the Labor government, that was Paul Keating. It was 

 the Howard Government that changed that and took women and children out of detention centres. So there were 

 many changes made to those policies over the years but they worked, they worked, they were a proven policy 

 package and effective.  

 Kevin Rudd said he could change all that and it would have no impact on the rate of arrivals. He thought he could 

 get rid of John Howard’s policies but still have the benefit of them. And of course what we have seen instead is a 

 surge in arrivals that is now close to 2200 people arriving this year and since the policies were changed at the 

 end of last year. And as Sharman Stone, who is here today as the Shadow Immigration Minister points out again 

 and again, echoing her predecessor as a shadow immigration minister, Julia Gillard; another boat, another policy 

 failure. That is what Julia Gillard used to say in years gone by when there were very few boats. Now we are 

 getting close to 50 boats arriving. And of course we have the appalling chaos really, the collapse of any sense of 

 direction or control in the case of the Oceanic Viking, the 78 people there floating aimlessly without any prospect 

 of a resolution in sight.  

 This is a Prime Minister who has completely lost control over one of the most fundamental objectives of a 

 national security policy which is the protection of our borders. And let me say this; we recognise that every 

 government should have two objectives when it comes to border protection and asylum seekers. The first should 

 be to ensure that our borders are secure and that we decide who comes to Australia. We choose who the 

 immigrants will be. We choose which asylum seekers will be accepted into Australia. Let us not delude ourselves 

 into thinking that we are harsh towards asylum seekers. We are one of the most generous countries in the world. 

 The only country that takes more refugees through the UN High Commission on Refugees process is the United 

 States of America, Australia takes the second largest number and of course on a per capita basis it is in fact the 

 largest number.  

 So Australia has a very generous and long tradition and I have to say a bipartisan tradition in reaching out and 

 taking in a large number of refugees. But the critical thing is we decide who will be brought to Australia. We make 

 that decision. It is your decision, the Australian people’s decision through your elected government. What Kevin 

 Rudd is doing is abandoning that objective and outsourcing our immigration program to the people smugglers. He 

 is saying that, to us, there is nothing he can do about it. He gave 14 interviews in 36 hours, the substance of 

 which was simply to say; get used to it.  

 Now the Australian people are not going to get used to outsourcing their immigration program, the humanitarian 

 stream of their immigration program to people smugglers. It is completely unacceptable and when we return to 

 government we will put an end to it - that I commit to here today.  

 Now the other objective that every government seeks to achieve in addition to keeping our borders secure and 

 eliminating so far as practicable people smuggling and unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers, the other 

 objective we all should seek to achieve is to treat asylum seekers and refugees generously and compassionately 

 in accordance with the UN Convention on Refugees. And that has always been our objective when we were in 

 government. We sought to do that and we were very aware of the need to treat all asylum seekers humanely and 

 generously and compassionately.  

 Kevin Rudd says that he’s seeking to do that too. He says his policy is tough but humane. Well it is clearly not 

 tough because the boats are coming in ever increasing numbers and if you are sitting there on the Oceanic 

 Viking I’m not sure you’d be convinced it was humane either. If you are sitting in an Indonesian detention centre 

 you may not regard it as humane either. You see the problem that Kevin Rudd has got now is he says he 

 complains that he is being attacked from the left and the right, well he is being attacked because his policy is 

 failing both objectives. He is neither keeping our borders secure nor is he treating asylum seekers generously 

 and compassionately. And what he has done, against the advice of every body, not just the Opposition - I mean 

 you can understand governments being sceptical about the advice they get from their political opponents - he 

 was told that his changes to border protection would give the people smugglers a powerful marketing tool that 

 would result in additional numbers of unauthorised arrivals by the Australian Federal Police; ignored. The 

 International Organisation for Migration; ignored. Indonesia’s own Ambassador; ignored. Right across the board 

 Kevin Rudd was told that what he was doing would have exactly the consequences it has. He ignored it and now 

 he refuses to concede the reality of the situation.  

 You will hear him talk about push factors. He will say there are more refugees wanting to come to Australia. Let 

 me tell you my friends, and I refer you to the UN High Commission on Refugees own report on this; June 2009, 

 you can get it on their website if you like. There are around 11 million people in the world who are categorised as 

 refugees. The number is actually slightly less than it was last year. But it is still gigantic and tragically so.  

 The push factor, that is to say the number of people that would like to live in Australia and who are refugees is, 

 always has been, and I fear in all probability always will be, enormous. So the push factor is always enormous. 

 What controls the rate of arrival above all is the Australian policy that reacts to it. How much of an incentive are 

 we offering to the people smugglers to aid their marketing efforts? How much easier are we making it for them to 

 persuade people to part with their money and go to sea in unseaworthy boats and risk their lives, and of course 

 risk the lives of the Australian defence personnel who have to come to their aid? And the fact is; Kevin Rudd’s 

 policies have outsourced our immigration program to the people smugglers. We know it. The Australian people 

 know it. And the only person that won’t admit it, and of course until he admits it, he’s not going to be able to 

 address the problem, the only person who won’t admit it is the author of this colossal policy failure, the Prime 

 Minister Kevin Rudd.  

 Now it is not just in terms of border protection that we are seeing colossal policy failures. At the beginning of this 

 year, back in February when Kevin Rudd decided we were staring into an abyss and that the global financial 

 crisis was the economic equivalent of a rolling national security crisis - this is the sort of temperate language of 

 course that a Prime Minister uses when he actually wants to create more economic problems then deal with them 

 - it was extraordinary the intemperate way he spoke about these economic difficulties - but at that time he 

 decided to borrow and spend at a rate that was unprecedented in our history and peacetime.  

 Now we know that Australia went into this economic downturn in a good shape and that was due to 11 and a half 

 years of sound economic management by the Liberal government. We went into there with no debt. We had cash 

 at the bank. We were in the black. Most other developed countries went into this downturn in the red, with 

 massive government debt already. We went into it without any Australian banking crisis. Because our banks and 

 financial institutions had been well regulated under the Howard Government and Peter Costello was the 

 Treasurer, we went in there with a banking system that had no counterpart to the US sub prime crisis. So that’s 

 why we haven’t had the dramatic upheavals in our financial system that they have had in the United States and in 

 Europe.  

 Indeed the four big Australian banks are among only a handful banks in the world that are AA rated or better. So 

 we also went in with a strong economy, unemployment at very low levels and of course with a Reserve Bank that 

 was genuinely independent - again courtesy of the reforms of the Howard Government - and that was able to 

 respond to the downturn by providing a monetary stimulus and reducing interest rates, which they did of course 

 very quickly. All of those factors put us in good shape.  

 So however bleak one thought the global situation was - and many people, most people in fact have been 

 surprised at how quickly things have turned around - but however bleak you thought it was, it was clear enough 

 wasn’t it that we were in a better position then other developed countries. And I remember saying at the time we 

 are in storm, we will get wet, but we won’t sink. And we did get a bit wet, perhaps we got less wet than even the 

 optimists might have thought. But nonetheless it was clear we were going to come through it.  

 Do you know Kevin Rudd borrowed and spent the third largest amount, in terms of fiscal stimulus, of any OECD 

 country? He went for broke in terms of borrowing and spending. And when he set…put up this proposal in 

 February, what was our response as Liberals? We didn’t say spend nothing, do nothing; we said why don’t we 

 spend a lot less, less than half we proposed - his stimulus was $42 billion - we said let’s spend between $15 and 

 20 billion, let’s do so in a much more targeted way so we will actually get value for money, let’s do it in a way that 

 genuinely helps small business and genuinely drives incentives for investment and employment. And so we 

 wanted to spend less and spend it in a more targeted way. And Kevin Rudd said; I will have none of that, the 

 world is coming to an end, we have got to throw everything at it. And we counted by saying; look, the Parliament 

 is not going to close down. If in fact we do need to spend more money we can come back and vote it then. Why 

 do we have to spend so much now and commit to so much spending now? Well obviously he carried the day the 

 Senate ultimately supported…. the Independents and the Greens supported the legislation and it happened. And 

 now we have the economy so much stronger then anyone anticipated.  

 The Reserve Bank yesterday is suggesting that it doesn’t believe unemployment is actually going to rise; at least 

 certainly not rise significantly. They have revised their forecast for growth upwards dramatically and they are 

 warning about inflation and, as we’ve seen, starting to increase interest rates again. Now at the same time that 

 the Reserve Bank is doing that and saying we’re just going to have to start putting the brakes on here, the 

 Government is continuing to spend. They refuse to recalibrate, slow down, adjust any of their spending. They 

 refuse to do that. We had, the day before yesterday, Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission 

 no less, speaking at the Melbourne Institute economic conference and he said the Government must recalibrate 

 its spending, it must do that because otherwise it is going to be working against the very objectives of economic 

 stability that ideally, notionally, everyone should be committed to.  

 So it is an extraordinary situation that we have now. We have the Reserve Bank in effect with a foot on the brake 

 and Wayne Swan with a foot on the accelerator and you wonder why the economy is starting to look like a car 

 bunny hopping around the car park driven by a teenager. This is the product of Kevin Rudd’s failure to take 

 responsible action on the economy, to take responsibility. He’s refused to take responsibility on border protection, 

 he’s refused to recognise that the economic environment has changed and so his economic policies should 

 change. He could say, look, everything I did I did with the best will in the world and that, in a sense, wouldn’t be 

 an admission of error - nobody’s got a perfectly clear crystal ball. But he will not even admit that the strategy that 

 he had in February when according to him we were staring into an economic abyss, he will not even admit that 

 that strategy is no longer appropriate today. So it’s an extraordinarily vain government and one that refuses to be 

 accountable.  

 The other issue that has become very relevant, and it’s relevant everywhere but particularly in the last few weeks, 

 is the whole question of infrastructure. You will have seen that the Rudd Government claims that they’re 

 spending money on infrastructure. Well they are spending $16 billion on Julia Gillard Memorial Assembly Halls 

 and you will get one of those whether you want it or not - and I mean it. And if there’s any shortage of space they 

 will knock down a hall and build a new Julia Gillard Memorial Assembly Hall. You think I’m joking. I promise you, 

 I’ve been to a perfectly nice school in Sydney at Abbotsford where there are four perfectly respectable, usable 

 classrooms. I’ve seen them. They’re fine. You would be delighted if your children were being taught in them. 

 They are going to be knocked down and replaced with four new or no doubt equally usable, serviceable 

 classrooms simply so there can be a Julia Gillard Memorial Hall plaque on the wall. Now that is $16 billion. Think 

 of the roads and the infrastructure that you need and think of how much of that could be built with $16 billion.  

 The Business Council of Australia recently commissioned a report on the infrastructure spending of the Rudd 

 Government and observed that of the whole fiscal stimulus spend only 14 per cent was being spent on economic 

 infrastructure - only 14 per cent. Talk about wasting a crisis. They are borrowing and spending at record levels 

 and what are we going to have to show for it; some $900 handouts which have all been spent and some Julia 

 Gillard Memorial Assembly Halls.  

 They have even had the audacity through the roads minister, Anthony Albanese, to announce that they have a 

 list of projects that they claim to have commissioned and undertaken as part of their great stimulus program and 

 on closer examination most of them were projects that had actually been started under the Howard Government. 

 And indeed to Warren Truss’s concern and surprise, one of the projects was not only one that he had kicked off 

 when he was the transport minister but it had actually been funded, built and opened by him in his own electorate 

 before the election and the Labor Party is claiming credit for that. So the audacity of the spin is extraordinary.  

 And then probably the most telling critique that was made at this conference over the last few days by Gary 

 Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission - and it really echoes everything that we’ve been saying, 

 particularly Senator Nick Minchin and I have been saying about the Government and their thoroughness. We all 

 know, and we all know from experience right around Australia, that it is possible for the private sector to do a lot 

 of research and analysis and make a substantial investment in infrastructure which turns out to be unsuccessful 

 in the sense that the patronage on the toll road or the tunnel is less than forecast and so it’s worth less than the 

 cost to build it. So those are the risks of business. All of us have had that experience one way or another. You 

 don’t always get it right. But you’ve got to do your homework. You’ve got a better chance of getting it right if you 

 do your homework.  

 The Business Council and the Productivity Commission have been flaying the Rudd Government for a reckless 

 refusal to do thorough feasibility analyses, cost-benefit analyses, even business plans, on the infrastructure 

 they’re proposing to invest in and build. And most notable of those is the National Broadband Network. You’ve 

 read about that - $43 billion - it’s only going to cover urban Australia in effect so rural and regional Australia, 

 which actually has the great crying need for access to affordable broadband, will miss out but they’re going to 

 spend $43 billion on this project which they have said will be commercial, commercially viable and into which the 

 private sector will invest. Yet there has been no business plan, no financial analysis, no feasibility study. Now you 

 might think that perhaps they’ve done one, they just haven’t told us about it. No. They admit they’ve done no 

 homework.  

 Lindsay Tanner was asked why there had been no analysis and he said in a remark that one wag said should 

 earn him a Nobel prize for economics, he said, “the problem with financial analysis is the outcome depends on 

 the assumptions you put into it.” What an insight! That’s the man guarding the finances of the nation.  

 Now you may wonder why Kevin Rudd can be so confident, so arrogant, so certain of his own rectitude, the 

 certainty and the correctness of his decisions whether it’s in border protection, whether it’s in economic policy, 

 failing to correct that as the economic circumstances change or his refusal to properly undertake research into 

 the viability of infrastructure. Why is he able to get away with this? And the answer my friends is that 

 fundamentally he has a different political philosophy to us. He comes from a different political tradition. He 

 believes that government should be at the centre of the economy. His words - not mine. This is not what a 

 Liberal leader is saying about the Labor Party. This is what he says about himself. He says that the last 30 years 

 of liberalism around the world and opening up of nations to free markets that have lifted hundreds of millions of 

 people out of poverty around the world, that have raised levels of prosperity everywhere, he says that was 30 

 years of failure, of neo-liberal free market extremism. And of course he identifies the Liberal Party as being in the 

 forefront of that neo-liberal free market extremism. I might say that therefore some of us chuckled a little when he 

 appointed to the Board of the Future Fund that well known, neo-liberal free market extremist, the former member 

 for Higgins, Peter Costello. But this is the philosophy that Kevin Rudd sets out. He believes that government 

 knows best.  

 Now as you know, and as I’ve said to you many times before, we on the other hand believe today and always 

 have believed and always will believe that government’s role is to enable you to do your best. We know that the 

 prosperity, the future, the security of Australia relies on the enterprise and the energy of thousands, millions of 

 Australians like you. And so our mission is to enable you to do your best to enable you to exercise your freedom 

 and realise your dreams. And that is the fundamental dividing line between us and Labor. We are a party of 

 freedom, enterprise, the individual, small business. Labor is a party of government, of big government, of 

 government knows best and the arrogance of that approach is becoming more and more apparent to Australians 

 every day. So we will stand true to our principles of freedom, economic responsibility, of recognising that taxes 

 are other people’s money and must be spent wisely and prudently. We will stand by our standard of freedom 

 because we are already starting to see that the mantra of big government is fraying as Mr Rudd’s spin is exposed 

 for the emptiness it really is.  

 Thank you very much.
