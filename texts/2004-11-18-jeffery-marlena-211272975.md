 SPEECH BY  HER EXCELLENCY  MRS MARLENA JEFFERY  LAUNCH THE ANGLICARE CHRISTMAS APPEAL 

 ST JOHN’S CARE, REID, ACT  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2004 

 

 

 The Right Reverend Allan Ewing, Chair, Anglicare Council  The Right Reverend George Browning, Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn  Doctor Beth Heyde, Chair, St John’s Care Management Committee  The Reverend Greg Thompson, Rector, St John the Baptist Church  Staff, volunteers and friends of Anglicare 

 Thank you so much for inviting me to participate in this very important occasion.    It’s a privilege to be here this morning to help launch the Anglicare ‘Be an Angel’  Christmas Appeal. 

 As a Canberra resident, I feel particularly honoured to support an organisation that  brings so much thought and care to assisting people and families in our region who,  for all sorts of reasons, are in need of some help - not just at Christmas but all through  the year. 

 Anglicare is single-minded in its focus on improving the lives of others and I want  you to know how very much I admire your work. 

 The many hundreds of fine people who, in myriad ways, support Anglicare know that  the essence of community service is not to be found in the things we do for the benefit  of people we know and love.  Community service is found in the things we do for the  benefit of people we don’t know and may never meet. 

 I know that for many of you here, service to others is a way of life.   

 And on occasions like this, when you call on the wider community to lend a hand, you  give us something precious too - the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to  the enormous demands on Anglicare’s financial and physical resources. 

 Although just ten years old in name, Anglicare  has been working at the heart of the  community for generations in one form or another. 

 It’s the practical, meaningful approach of your organisation that appeals to me. I see  this in a range of activities and projects, including: 

  Ã  The one-on-one pastoral care chaplaincy program at Goulburn Jail; 

  Ã  The school breakfast club providing healthy starts for children who 

  would normally come to school on empty stomachs; 

  Ã  Supporting refugee families especially those from the Sudan; 

  Ã  Assisting youngsters (the 10-18 year olds) who are the principal 

  carers in their families; and 

  Ã  Helping people with mental health issues through social contact at 

  drop-in centres, skills development and outings - people who may otherwise be left to  fend for themselves.

  I admire also the breadth of Anglicare’s expertise - the knowledge and understanding  of disadvantage and poverty - the way the organisation responds to the challenge of  being at the coalface, thoroughly contemporary, soundly professional and rigorously  researched:  

  Ã  from small neighbourhood services operating at a local level, 

  Ã  through to established national charitable programs. 

  There is a Chinese saying which I believe crystallises the Anglicare approach to the  responsibilities it shoulders and its philosophy of encouraging others to support its  work: 

   “Tell me and I’ll forget; 

   Show me and I may remember; 

   Involve me and I’ll understand.” 

  I commend this occasion for seeking to mark out the differences in our regional  communities, being sensitive and practical in the ways you support impoverished  people, and engaging community thought and action. 

  Ladies and gentlemen. I can conclude on an optimistic note because the challenges  that humanity faces would look significantly bleaker were it not for people like you  who generously engage in private action for the public good, on a daily basis. 

  It is the staff, friends and supporters of Anglicare who are willing to say that we  cannot accept that this is the best humanity can create in terms of the quality of life  that we have for all people. We can do more. 

  Michael joins me in commending your work, and in challenging the wider community  to get in behind this year’s Appeal. 

  It is my great pleasure to declare the 2004 Anglicare Christmas Appeal officially  launched.
