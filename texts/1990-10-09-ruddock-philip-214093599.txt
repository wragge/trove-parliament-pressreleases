 ECONOMY TO BLAME 9/10/90

 The 1989/90 immigration program target was for 140,000 new  settlers.

 The result released yesterday by the Bureau of Immigration  Research in its publication "Immigration Update" was an outcome  of 121,277.

 Stripping away the rationalisations the result is clear. In  recession younger, skilled, educated and more employable migrants  lose interest in Australia as a destination.

 This is more clearly indicated when it is understood that New  Zealand citizen arrivals for permanent settlement fell by 50%.

 More importantly however in the area of family reunion, the  number of spouses, de-factos and fiancees entering Australia  continued to increase while all other family categories were in  decline.

 This reflects the fact that the family reunion category of entry  contains many non bona-fide entrants.

 The failure of administration to ensure the detection of  sham-marriages entered into only to secure migrant entry is  becoming of scandalous proportion.

 It is in the area of points tested entry, namely concessional  (extended) family migrants and independent entry where the  greatest downturn has occurred.

 The other side of the immigration equation is the outcome for  those Australians leaving permanently. The number of permanent  departures decreased by 29% to 27,857. There can be no clearer  message about the extent of the Australian recession when 

 increasing numbers of our countrymen are leaving Australia to  find new opportunities.

 The most significant proportion of departures includes the 10,879  people settling in New Zealand followed by the 6,406 Australians  leaving for the United Kingdom and Ireland.

 Interestingly, the largest percentage increase was the 50%  additional departures for Asia. The total this year reached 2259.

 Attached is a copy of the commentary from the Bureau of  Immigration Research.

 COMMENTARY

 Arrivals and Departures

 The number of settlers arriving in the financial year 1989-90 was 121,227 which is a  decrease of 17 per cent compared with 1988-89. At the same time the number of  permanent departures increased by 29 per cent, to 27,857. This resulted in a net  permanent gain for 1989-90 of 93,370 which was 25 per cent less than the net gain of 

 123,680 recorded in the previous year.

 The decrease in arrivals reflected changes made in 1988 and 1989 to migration  processing arrangements affecting the issue of visas to applicants under the points-  tested Concessional (ie extended) Family and Independent categories. Another major  factor was the decrease by 50 per cent in the number of New Zealand Citizen arrivals, 

 from 27,234 in 1988-89 to 13,345 in 1989-90.

 Although arrivals from most countries were down in 1989-90, notable exceptions  include USSR, Romania, Hong Kong and Vietnam.

 The number of permanent departures increased by 29 per cent in 1989-90, from 21,647  in 1988-89 to 27,857 in 1989-90. This was the highest number of permanent departures  since 1974-75. Permanent departures of former settlers (ie those who arrived in  Australia with the stated intention to stay permanently) increased by 10 per cent, mainly  as a result of the 30 per cent increase in departures of former settlers who had resided in  Australia for between 1 and 4 years. Permanent departures of other Australian residents  (mainly New Zealand arid Australian-born) increased by 48 per cent, reflecting the  large increase of New Zealanders returning home.

 Of the total permanent departures of Australian residents in 1989-90, 39 per cent were  leaving to live in New Zealand, 23 per cent in the UK and Ireland, 8 per cent in the  USA and 3 per cent in Canada.

 As well as the 17 per cent decrease in the number of settler arrivals, from 145,316 in  1988-89 to 121,227 in 1989-90, the composition of the settler intake in 1989-90  differed in some significant respects from one year earlier.

 The most notable change was the decrease of 50 per cent in the number of New Zealand  citizens who arrived with the stated intention to stay permanently. As a result the  proportion of settlers arriving under the Special Eligibility Category as New Zealand  Citizens decreased to 11 per cent in 1989-90, compared with 19 per cent in 1988-89.

 The number of settler arrivals under all the Family categories was down by 16 per cent  compared with 1988-89. The number of Spouses and Fiancees increased by 6 per cent,  while the number of Concessional (extended) Family Migrants decreased by almost 30  per cent (from 28,187 in 1988-89 to 19,907 in 1989-90). Overall the proportion of 

 settlers arriving as Family Migrants in 1989-90 was 41 per cent, the same as in  1988-89.

 The number of arrivals under the Skilled Migration Categories (which includes also the  family of persons selected as skilled migrants) was down slightly on 1988-89. However  the Skilled categories increased substantially as a proportion of total settler arrivals,  from 30 per cent in 1988-89 to 35 per cent in 1989-90. The increase was mainly due to 

 the Employer Nominees and Business Migration categories.

 The proportion of settlers arriving under the Humanitarian categories increased from 7  per cent to 10 per cent, with a decrease in the number of Refugees but an increase in the  number of arrivals under the Special Humanitarian Programs.

 Citizenship (See Table 2.9 on Page 31)

 The number of persons granted Australian citizenship during 1989-90 was 130,312.  This was the highest number of citizenships granted in a single year and was 35 per  cent higher than in the previous year, mainly attributable to the interest generated  during the Year of Citizenship which ran until October 1989. Although the increase was 

 spread across almost all nationalities, particularly significant were the large number of  citizenships granted to British and Irish, New Zealander and Filipino nationals.
