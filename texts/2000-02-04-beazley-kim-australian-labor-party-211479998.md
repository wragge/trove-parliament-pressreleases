  BEAZLEY:

  John Howard's scheme is too little too late for the 
National Textile workers. Mr Howard undertook, or Mr Reith on his behalf, 
that he would have in place by the beginning of this year a guarantee 
for workers' entitlements. The guarantee is not there. The proposition 
of the Government, which shifts the burden from employers to taxpayers, 
does not even scratch the surface of what workers' entitlements are 
and that they've lost in cases like the National Textile workers. The 
Labor has now had in place a couple of pieces of legislation for some 
years now that would assist with that. And we released last year a scheme 
which would, if acted upon, ensure that the National Textiles workers 
secured all their entitlements. And it is a cheaper scheme for taxpayers, 
because it appropriately, properly, shifts the burden to employers, 
the taxpayers guarantee associated with it applying only to some small 
businesses. So, John Howard is too little, too late for the National 
Textile workers.

  JOURNALIST:

  ...(inaudible)...

  BEAZLEY:

  We did some things when we were in office. But the 
truth is some of the more innovative schemes by which employers evade 
their responsibilities have come to the fore in increasing amounts these 
last few years. Partly, as a result of Government encouragement, as 
was the case by Peter Reith with Patrick during the MUA dispute. So, 
it has become a mechanism, an industrial mechanism, a more popular mechanism 
than it has been ever before. Now, the Government has had four years 
to act on it and, more to the point, the Government promised to act 
on it by the beginning of this year. And the indications were, when 
they said they would act on it, that workers would get their entitlements. 
Now, their scheme scarcely scratches the surface of those entitlement 
and puts the burden on the taxpayer when really the burden should be 
on the employers.

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Beazley, what's wrong with the Howard Government 
taking..?

  BEAZLEY:

  The Howard Government scheme does not cover enough. 
It does not ensure workers get their full entitlements. And it leaves 
them with a derisory amount. It's merely a backstop. It also has the 
burden that rests implicitly ... in fact, entirely on the taxpayer. 
Labor put out a scheme using an enhancement of the superannuation guarantee 
levy that would guarantee that workers get their full entitlements. 

  JOURNALIST:

  How would you describe Mr Howard's trip through the 
bush this week?

  BEAZLEY:

  It's been a disaster for Mr Howard. It was a lecture 
tour in the end. It was a combination between a lecture tour and an 
apology tour when it should have been a listening tour. He finally did 
a bit of listening today as he sat down with the National Textile workers 
on their problems. But from the point of view of the bush, they got 
from Mr Howard nothing except this politically blackmailing proposition: 
sell Telstra and then you'll get some benefits in the bush. But the 
Auditor-General has come out with a report on how they spent their money 
from the first Telstra sale which clearly constituted, effectively, 
a Liberal Party election slush fund of pork barrelling.

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Beazley, will you be going to the bush?

  BEAZLEY:

  I frequently go to the bush, regularly. In fact, 
I'm delighted to see in one of the Ballarat newspapers, a complaint 
that Mr Howard did not include Ballarat in his regional and bush tour, 
pointing out, very appropriately, I thought, that I'd been there five 
times as Leader of the Opposition compared to Mr Howard's once.

  JOURNALIST:

  Speaking of Victoria, do you have any comment on 
the power crisis? The Government has had to move in compulsory...

  BEAZLEY:

  A very serious situation and a very unacceptable 
situation for the people of Victoria and South Australia. Its origins 
lie in the actions of Peter Reith and the then Premier Kennett over 
the industrial relations legislation. This is a test of Mr Howard's 
industrial relations legislation and it's a failure. The Victorian Government, 
of course is hamstrung in this particular dispute because its industrial 
relations powers have effectively been handed to the Commonwealth. It 
is doing what it can.

  JOURNALIST:

  When you consider the BHP issue as well, is there 
a point at which employers are now prepared to even run with collective 
bargaining as...

  BEAZLEY:

  Any opinion poll that goes into the minds of the 
average Australian you'll see at the centre the core of their concerns 
a sense of insecurity. And part of that insecurity stems from their 
industrial situation. Every Australian knows that he or she does not 
bargain on a basis of equality with their employer. Every Australian 
knows that to ask for convenient hours for the family and for decent 
remuneration that their best chance is through collective bargaining. 
The whole point of the industrial relations legislation put in place 
by Mr Reith has been to encourage employers to get rid of collective 
bargaining. Some employers have taken advantage of that and continue 
to do so. The consequence of that for Australian families is a decline 
in their security and a decline in their happiness.

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Beazley, we're being told that illegal immigrants 
at the Curtin Airbase detention centre are on a hunger strike because 
conditions aren't good enough. What would you say to that?

  BEAZLEY:

  Well, I think that every effort should be taken to 
discourage illegal immigration. There should be no doubt about that. 
Queue jumpers - this is a generous country when it comes to dealing 
with refugees - and so we should be. But queue jumpers are not acceptable 
in that environment. Nevertheless, when people are here in whatever 
circumstances they are here they ought to be treated well. What the 
circumstances are there, I don't know. But I do know that when parliamentary 
committees have been up there to have a look at it, and they included 
Labor Members, they were not unhappy with what they saw.

  JOURNALIST:

  ...retail figures?

  B  EAZLEY:

  This is consistent with the economy apparently slowing, 
these particular retail trade figures. And what it points to is the 
argument the Labor Party has made that the inflationary pressures out 
there at the moment are GST related. And the rise in the official interest 
rates is a product of the GST. It's a product of the GST on these fronts. 
Firstly, the fears that the Reserve Bank have that in a tightening labour 
market, with fewer and fewer skills and personnel to meet the skilled 
vacancies, the Reserve Bank is particularly concerned about the propensity 
for workers to claim the full amount in wage rises from the impact of 
inflation - GST induced inflation. That's one worry that he's got. Because, 
clearly, the GST is going to produce a higher rate of inflation than 
the Government admitted. Secondly, of course, the GST compensation package. 
Facing the circumstances we now face, no Government in normal circumstances 
would produce what is potentially a considerable punch through in consumer 
spending and consumer capability. But you're spending resources on investing 
in the future or investing in the retirement of the Australian population 
are the sorts of things that were cut in the Government's Budget cuts. 
So, the Budget settings are wrong. And it means that unnecessarily the 
economy faces a rise in official interest rates because in normal circumstances, 
without these Government induced problems, you would not expect interest 
rates to be rising with evidence like this around.

  JOURNALIST:

  With the GST does that mean..?

  BEAZLEY:

  I don't know what the next lot of retail figures 
will be. But what clearly is indicated here is a trend. And the trend 
is to a hauling back of consumption. Now, that's bad news for the Government 
on a number of fronts, partly because growth has been almost entirely 
consumption based when good growth would have at least had a very substantial 
investment component. Now as a result of the GST a major impediment 
is now placed in the way of what should be the focus of Government - 
and that is getting business out there and investing. So, it indicates 
... this provides grist to the mill for those in business who've argued 
to the Reserve Bank that they should not be raising interest rates like 
this, that the economy has come off the boil. But the Reserve Bank is 
not simply looking at the underlying economic reality. They're looking 
at the consequences, the multifarious consequences, of the GST punch 
through.

  JOURNALIST:

  Are you confident that the Bank will heed the Prime 
Minister's ... increase..?

  BEAZLEY:

  The Prime Minister gives all the indications of a 
King Canute when comes to the banks. He sort of rails against them and 
criticises them for responding to the rise in official rates by raising 
their own rates. I suggest he should look to his own knitting - because 
it is his own knitting which has produced these circumstances which 
put the banks in the position where they're able to do this.

  Ends
