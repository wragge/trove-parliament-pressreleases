 PETER DUTTON:    

 I’m really pleased to confirm the Government will introduce our legislation in relation  to the citizenship changes within the coming week.    

 We want to make sure that all Australians are reassured by the fact that these  changes are meant to be very tangible and they come at an important time. They  come at a time when we do want people to respect Australian citizenship. Many  people, in fact five million people since 1949, have become Australian citizens. The  vast majority of those people have done the right thing, they’ve bided by the law,  they’ve abided by Australian values and they’ve made great Australian citizens.   

 The reality is that we do need to update and upgrade the arrangements in relation to  Australian citizenship and that’s what we’re going to do in the Parliament this week.    

 We do make a number of changes, as we confirmed in April, in relation to  requirements about permanent residency being extended from one year to four, in  relation to making sure that people can provide information to show that they have  integrated into Australian society, and that won’t be just a point in time check, we will  be looking at the last four years or a period beyond that in fact if that’s appropriate.  There are a number of other changes that we make in relation to competency around  English language. We have a particular problem with gang violence in Victoria at the  moment, we are very conscious of that, so for children under the age of 18, for  people that haven’t been of good character they will need to face further checks as  well.   

 So there are some significant changes that are taking place. The Labor Party will  receive a copy of the Bill this week; they’ve already had a briefing in relation to the  Bill. This is an important issue for the Australian Labor Party to support the  Government on; I think it’s an issue that requires bipartisan support. I suspect we will

 get support of the independent Senators in the Senate, but there’s obviously  negotiations to take place in that regard, but this is an issue where we would want  the Labor Party to support the Government.   

 I know there have been a number of Labor Party members who have been out there  talking down the proposals that we’re putting forward, but I would ask them to wait to  see the detail before they decide that they are not going to vote in favour of this Bill.   It is a very important Bill, it is a Bill that suits our times that we’re living in and the  Government is very serious about making sure that people who pledge their  allegiance to our country mean it, that they abide by our laws and our values and  that’s the reason that we have taken what I think is a very necessary step.   

 

 JOURNALIST:     

 Minister, will teenage migrants caught doing the wrong thing, are they going to be  caught up in this legislation as well?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 Yes they will be. And as we’re seeing in Victoria at the moment, but elsewhere  around the country, children as young as 15 or 16 years of age are conducting  themselves like adult criminals and in Victoria at the moment you are getting -people  being followed home from restaurants, their homes being invaded, their car keys  stolen and people being assaulted, shops are being robbed. This is a particularly  significant issue in Victoria as you know, but it can be an issue anywhere else in the  country.    

 Now in that circumstance we do want to have a look at the character of that  individual and if that person has been of poor character and they’ve been committing  criminal offences for example then they can remain on a permanent visa, if their visa  can be cancelled at an appropriate time that could be the course of action taken, but  there won’t be automatic conferral and it may mean that they can remain on a  permanent visa and become an Australian citizen at some other point in time when  they can prove good character.  But if they have been involved in violence, gang  violence, terrorist related activity, whatever it might be, then they won’t be getting  Australian citizenship.   

 

 JOURNALIST:    

 Minister, when you announced the principles behind this in April you didn’t then have  a fully formed test or version of the test, does the legislation come with attachments  that may include more than just the principles behind the test?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 3 

 www.minister.border.gov.au 

 There’ll be obviously detailed contained within the Bill itself and the Regulations  otherwise will contain detail and as I say we’re happy to continue to work with the  crossbench Senators as well as the Labor Party, but this really is a test for Mr  Shorten because we want the Labor Party to support the Government.    

 We’ve taken a tough decision in relation to tightening up in relation to those people  that want to apply for citizenship and it does deserve bipartisan support and I hope  that Mr Shorten will see his way clear to provide that support.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Beyond questions about child marriage, female genital mutilation and domestic  violence can you give us examples about what else may be asked in the revised  test?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 I wouldn’t discount any of those issues.    

 I mean domestic violence is a very serious issue in our country. The fact is that  people who are perpetrating domestic violence can’t expect to become Australian  citizens.   

 English language requirements for example at the level of competency is a very  necessary step, now there are carve-outs for people over the age of 60 and under  the age of 16, but for people who want to make the most of their chance in Australia;  whether it’s in education, employment, integration otherwise into society, just being  members of a local community; we do expect people to have an English language  competency and we haven’t apologised for that.    

 It’s a very deliberate act that we’ve taken so there are other measures as well and  my Department, all the time, makes decisions in relation to visa applicants and their  suitability on all of the facts available in relation to a particular applications.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Minister on another matter, former Assistant Chief Commissioner of Scotland Yard  Tariq Gafur says it’s impossible to monitor all of those people in the UK who are of  interest to MI5 and that the time has come to set up special centres to detain  Britain’s 3000 extremists; and retired Major General Jim Molan has proposed  internment as a form of societal self-protection. Has the time come to consider those  kinds of measures?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:

 www.minister.border.gov.au 

 The Government’s not going to intern people. We have a very deliberate strategy of  making sure that we can target those people that are a threat both the resources of  ASIO, the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force, all of the state policing  agencies, everybody, is taking the best chance they can to keep Australians safe.    

 Significant resources have been given in this Budget process to ASIO and to the  AFP and other agencies to make sure they can keep Australians safe.    

 So in relation to our domestic situation, we do have a significant issue to deal with,  particularly with returning foreign fighters and all of us who are involved in the  national security space are working together to make sure that we can reduce the  threat as best as we can and that’s the situation that we preside over.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Minister, on another debate that’s likely to be had in Parliament this coming week.    

 Do you have a view on where the Finkel Review has landed and whether it’s  adequate enough to keep coal in the system and how do you anticipate the Party  Room might discuss this?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 Well, I’ll leave the discussion to the Party Room. We’ve obviously had a briefing and  I’ve spoken to Minister Frydenberg about it. The only point I’d make, I know that Josh  has been out there today, is to commend Josh for the work that he’s done, I think  that it’s a difficult issue for many reasons and I think the Finkel Review has provided  a way forward.    

 Obviously there’s going to be game playing by those on the Left of the Labor Party, I  think Anthony Albanese is out there trying to take any opportunity he can at the  moment to create difficulty for Bill Shorten and what we would want is a reasonable  position from the Labor Party, but I’ll leave the negotiations and discussions to  Minister Frydenberg.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 ….[inaudible]…..Peter Dutton, you’ve had this long running discussion about whether  or not to bring some elements of homeland security into one portfolio….   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 Sam, you’re so predictable…I saw you walk in, I expected the question, it seems to  be a recurrent question, I’ll just repeat it as I have in the months past. It is an issue  for the Prime Minister in terms of any of those machinery of government changes, 

 5 

 www.minister.border.gov.au 

 any changes that would be made would be based on what is in our national best  interest and truly it’s an issue for the Prime Minister, I just can’t add to it.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Dutton, the Liberal Party’s always argued in recent years you are the party of low  power prices, Tony Abbot argues that point. Dr Finkel says the CET will deliver lower  power prices, what’s your message to conservative colleagues who are already  disputing Dr Finkel’s findings claiming his methodology is wrong?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 I haven’t seen the comments to which you refer. The only point that I’d make is that  I’ve had a briefing on the report, obviously there’s further detail around pricing etc in  relation to some aspects; all of that is for Minister Frydenberg I’ll let him comment on  that.   

 But the Liberal Party is absolutely determined to make sure we can deliver for  families and small business and energy cost is a significant input cost for small  businesses. There’s a significant problem for families when their electricity bills are  going up every quarter, so we want to do whatever we can to reduce those prices we  want to reduce emissions and we want to make sure we’ve got a sustainable system  and a reliable system because the worst possible outcome is to get yourself into  South Australia’s position where there are brownouts or blackouts and people are  going without energy which means that for businesses they make a decision not to  invest in those particular economies and they move to other markets which results in  the loss of jobs and an economy like South Australia. So I don’t think anyone wants  to be following that example.    

 

 JOURNALIST:    

 Just in terms of the latest on the recent terror attacks, you’ve made some points in  relation to the link between refugees and terrorism or the lack of a causal link as  you’ve put it in relation to that, but if we were to move to a system more of temporary  protection visas do you think there would be more scope to basically cancel the  citizenship of people that were then later found, after their claims were found to be  genuine, to have been involved in terror related activity?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 Sam I’m prepared to consider anything that’s within the law to keep our public safe.    

 That’s my job and I do it on a daily basis in terms of the record number of visas that  we’ve cancelled - up by some 1200 per cent of people that have committed criminal  offences - we want to make out society a safe place, we don’t want people bringing  their troubles to our country.  

 6 

 www.minister.border.gov.au 

 We want people to take the opportunity that’s been afforded them, we want them to  work hard, we want them to provide for their children and set up a life that millions of  migrants before them have done.    

 In relation to the announcement we’ve made today, the extension of one year to four  years of the permanent residency does give us that ability to say to people over a  longer period of time - demonstrate that if you’re of working age, you have been  working. If your kids are of a school age, that they have been enrolled in school, that  they are attending school, that you are able to speak English to a competent level  etc etc.    

 So that principle being applied is an important one, as we’ve announced today and  as I say I’m willing to consider any measure which can be demonstrated to keep the  public safe, to reduce the threat and to make sure that the Australian public has  confidence in the migration programmes that we have in this country.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Can I just get your thoughts on this NSW announcement to set up a special prison  for terrorists out at Goulburn?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 Well I haven’t had a briefing on it, but from what I’ve seen publicly I think the NSW  Government should be applauded for the steps that they are taking across the  counter terrorism space. There’s obviously a lot of work that we do with NSW Police  - joint operations with Australian Border Force - and we work very closely with them.   

 We don’t want people within the prison environment being indoctrinated, being  converted into a radical form of Islam. We don’t want those people coming out a  bigger threat than when they went into jail.    

 So any measures that the states can take, obviously NSW is leading the way here,  but that other states, including in particular, Victoria, could take in this regard I think  would be welcome. I think Australians would expect that.    

 So I think the NSW Government’s taken its responsibility, in terms of people who are  incarcerated, very seriously and they should be commended for that.    

 

 JOURNALIST:    

 Isn’t there concerns though that if you house them all in one place it becomes a  breeding ground for jihadis?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 7 

 www.minister.border.gov.au 

 Well there are reports now about people that are being radicalised within prison  systems. People who had no background, no ideology, no religious belief that would  indicate that they might be susceptible to being radicalised, now if that’s happening  with people within the mainstream of prison systems then it’s a significant concern  and as I say the states have responsibilities to make sure that people are being  rehabilitated, that that evil is not being spread and if their experts are telling them  that this is a better way to go, then I’d rely on the experts.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 And can I just ask with your citizenship laws which you’re introducing into Parliament  this week; if Labor doesn’t support all the changes that you want how confident are  you that you are going to be able to get 11 of the 12 crossbenchers across the line?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 Well we’ll work with the crossbenchers, but I think their initial response to the  announcement in April that the Prime Minister and I made, was positive. I think we  have the ability to work to work with the independent Senators.    

 But as I say, this is an issue that should have bipartisan support. Mr Shorten  originally said that he agreed with the principles that we were espousing, in the  intervening period we’ve had some very concerning public commentary by members  of the Labor Party who said that they don’t support what the Government is  proposing, that they don’t support a test around Australian values, that they don’t  support the English language competency requirement and I think Mr Shorten needs  to reign in the Left of the Labor Party. If he can do that, we can get bipartisan support  for a Bill I think that, in this time, sends a very clear message to the Australian public  that this is a serious issue, it needs the support of both sides of Parliament and I  think it’s an issue for Mr Shorten now to show leadership on.   

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 But is the four year wait the biggest sticking point, do you think, in your legislation?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 No. Look I don’t think that’s controversial at all. If you look at other western  democracies four years is at the lower end. There are other countries that have eight  years, five years etc so that’s not out of the ordinary at all. So if there are particular  problems that they’ve got they should let us know, but I seriously don’t understand   why Mr Shorten’s not able to reign in the Left of the Party because this is a decision  that needs to be made in our national interest and we would expect Mr Shorten to  step up.

 JOURNALIST:   

 Is there any urgency about passage on this Bill, are you for instance relaxed about a  Senate committee inquiry process?   

 

 PETER DUTTON:   

 I would expect that it to go off to a Senate committee and that’s fine.    

 I think Australians will want to have their say, I think the public will want to have their  say, and I think there is broad support as was indicated in the review that was done  in 2015 by Connie Fierravanti-Wells and Philip Ruddock.    

 There was broad support expressed to us around the country since we made the  announcement in April and I can’ understand the Labor Party’s hesitancy, so let’s  hope that they can support it, if they do then we can get quick passage and I think  our country will be better for having passed these laws.   

 Thanks.
