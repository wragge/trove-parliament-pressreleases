 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 7 September 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH THE HON. TERESA GAMBARO MHR,  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BRISBANE,  BRISBANE   

 Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; border protection.   

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s good to be here in the federal seat of Brisbane with Teresa Gambaro, the local member and Shadow  Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration. I want to thank Essilor for having me and Teresa here today. This  is typical of the many businesses right around Australia that are doing it tough and will do it much harder  under a carbon tax. I’ll ask Teresa to say a bit more about Essilor in a minute, but this is a business which is  doing less and less in Australia because - amongst other things - the carbon tax means that manufacturing  conditions are going to get harder and harder in Australia.    

 So I say to the Prime Minister, if she’s fair dinkum about protecting jobs in this country, if she’s fair dinkum  about protecting manufacturing in this country drop the toxic tax. I say to Labor members of parliament do  not surrender on the jobs of your constituents when this tax goes into the parliament. I think it’s high time  that we saw more Labor members of parliament standing up for the jobs of their constituents rather than  making excuses for a floundering Prime Minister.   

 Now, this is actually the anniversary of the day the independents gave the government to Julia Gillard after  the last election. She is a Prime Minister who was selected not elected. She was selected first by the factions  and second by the independents. She was never really chosen by the Australian people in what was at best  for her an inconclusive election. Since then we’ve had things going from bad to worse. She said a year or so  back that she was going to fix up border protection, fix up climate change, fix up the mining tax. Well, the  mining tax is still far from resolved, climate change has turned into the bad tax based on a lie and as we  know border protection has just descended into chaos with the complete collapse of the Government’s  policies.   

 Finally, let me say that if the Prime Minister is serious about offshore processing, she must raise this with  the leaders of PNG and Nauru at the Pacific Islands conference. What’s the point of her going to the Pacific  Islands conference if she’s not prepared to raise the subject of processing centres, detention centres in PNG  and Nauru while she’s there? This is by far the most important issue between Australia and these countries.  It’s only right and proper that the Prime Minister who is going to Auckland at taxpayers’ expense tries to  resolve the problems which are so distressing and angering the taxpayers of Australia and I call on the Prime

 Minister, swallow your pride; stop the stubbornness; talk to the President of Nauru; talk to the Prime  Minister of PNG about getting these offshore detention centres open again.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, you’ll be attending the meeting this afternoon. What’s your hopes from that briefing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I’m going to listen carefully and respectfully to what the officials have to say, but I make the point that  the ball is in the Prime Minister’s court. I am happy to be as constructive as I can be to put beyond legal  doubt offshore processing - very happy to be as constructive as I can be - but we still don’t have a proposal  from the Government. We don’t have a proposal from the Government, and what I say is that if the  Government is fair dinkum we will have offshore processing. Nauru is the obvious place for it. We’ll also  have temporary protection visas. We’ll also have the option of turning boats around where it’s safe to do so.    

 Now, before we have further questions Teresa, you might like to say a bit about Essilor and the contribution  they make to your electorate.   

 TERESA GAMBARO:   

 Thank you, Tony. Look, Essilor is a great local company and many families depend and work for Essilor.  The cost of a carbon tax will only increase the additional costs on producing the world class lenses that are  made here that are responsible for 65 per cent of the market. We’re very concerned about the increase in  imposts and the company is already doing it tough at the moment without the impost of an additional tax.   

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, on the carbon tax what can the Opposition do to delay the vote in parliament?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, we think that the legislation, like all pieces of legislation, should be properly considered. We don’t  think that it should be rammed through just to suit the political convenience of the Government. What  normally happens with new bills, particularly very complex new bills, is that they are referred off to a  committee for proper consideration. Now I think that’s what should happen here. I don’t think that  committees should unduly delay bills but we owe it as MP’s to the Australian people that we represent to  ensure that all legislation is properly considered, particularly very complex legislation, and this is the most  complex of all legislation. It is designed to change the way every Australian lives and works. It’s legislation  for which the parliament has no mandate. In fact, if anything, it has a mandate not to introduce this  legislation and that’s why I think it should be subject to at least the usual level of scrutiny.    

 QUESTION:    

 In your briefing this afternoon do you expect to be told that you are being ill-informed in pushing for Nauru  to be an offshore processing site?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I’ll also have with me the Shadow Attorney-General George Brandis SC. George is a lawyer of  considerable standing and I’m sure that we can bandy legal opinions at 20 paces if needs be.

 QUESTION:    

 Is George your legal advice, is he?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 George is my principal legal adviser. He is not my only source of legal advice but he is certainly the  Opposition’s principal source of legal advice.    

 QUESTION:    

 Would you be happy to lend him to the Government, give them some legal advice?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think that what’s important here is the right outcome for Australia and the right outcome for  Australia is to stop the boats and offshore processing is a very important part of stopping the boats. We had  a problem some years ago and John Howard fixed the problem. It wasn’t easy to fix. It required tough  leadership from the then government…   

 QUESTION:   

 That was before this High Court decision too, wasn’t it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 … but the government did not shirk tough leadership and that’s what we need again. We need tough  leadership on a difficult issue. Now, on the High Court’s decision, I want to make just a couple of points.  First of all, Nauru happened under the existing legislation. That’s the first point I make. Second point I make  is that since Nauru was in operation before, Nauru has acceded to the UN convention on refugees. Third  point, very important that I make, is that the legal system of Nauru is essentially the same as Australia’s. We  have senior Australian judges who sit on the Supreme Court of Nauru and the High Court of Australia is the  final court of appeal for Nauru. So any suggestion that Nauru lacks protections for human rights, that Nauru  lacks the due process of law - quite wrong.    

 QUESTION:    

 So are you going into this briefing with the attitude that you only want Manus Island and Nauru?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Remember Manus Island is the Government’s own policy. Until the High Court’s decision last week the  Government said that they wanted offshore processing at Manus Island. So, I want to help them to be able to  realise their own policy. Now, if it’s right to process in Manus Island, it’s right to process in Nauru. The  former government had offshore processing at both Nauru and Manus. I think that a government that’s  serious about offshore processing will reopen both those centres.   

 QUESTION:    

 If you are told this afternoon in the meeting that Nauru isn’t an option, where does it leave you?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, let’s wait and see what the briefing shows, what the briefing holds. But the point I’ve made is that we  are happy to make legislative changes if that’s what is needed to put the legal position regarding offshore  processing beyond doubt. We want offshore processing to happen; until last week so did the Government.  We think that Malaysia is a bad deal - so does everyone except the Prime Minister and the Immigration  Minister. So, as far as I’m concerned Malaysia is out. But if they are serious about offshore processing - and  as of last week they said they were serious about Malaysia and Manus - well we want to make offshore  processing happen, we want to put it beyond legal doubt. We want to allow them to continue with their  Manus policy, but as well as Manus let’s have Nauru because Nauru has a greater capacity than Manus.  Nauru, I think, offers more humane conditions than Manus. Nauru is also I think probably a healthier  location for people than Manus.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, earlier this year you said that you wouldn’t tolerate Cory Bernardi transgressing again on the  anti-Islam front. Are you disappointed that he’s trying to bring Mr Wilders, the controversial Dutch  politician, to Australia?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well that’s not the position, he’s not. I don’t…   

 QUESTION:   

 He’s offered to help him with his itinerary and scheduling and…   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No he hasn’t, no he hasn’t and the Coalition has nothing to do with the organisation of any trip.   

 QUESTION:   

 You’ve spoken about legal advice from 20 yards. Does that mean that no matter what the advice the  Government says it’s got, you’re still going to push for offshore processing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 But this is the Government’s policy. I mean, let’s get this straight; it is the Government’s policy to have  offshore processing. It’s the Government that said months ago that they wanted to get offshore processing  happening at Manus Island. Now they say it’s legally impossible. I’m saying, ok, I’m happy to be  constructive. If we need to change the law to make offshore processing at Manus and at places like Nauru  possible, let’s talk. Let’s do it. I don’t want the Government to say that its hands are tied. I don’t want the  Government to be able to cave-in to the Greens and the left wing here. I think that if we want a government  that actually protects our borders, it’s got to have the option of offshore processing and if they say it’s  legally impossible, I say let’s make what adjustments are necessary to make it legally possible.   

 Now, I think that as things stand we could send people to Nauru, but to the extent that there’s legal doubt  let’s remove it. Let’s remove it and that way the Government can go ahead with Manus Island, a former  Pacific Solution processing centre; and if they’re going to go ahead with Manus Island, let’s go to the best  possible offshore processing destination which is Nauru.

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think politicians should be making legislative changes every time there’s a High Court decision that  the politicians don’t agree with?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well in the end it is the parliament that makes the laws and if the will of the parliament is at issue, well it’s  the will of the parliament that should prevail.   

 QUESTION:   

 How long will that take though and do we have time up our sleeve to be able to go into that process?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think as soon as the Government makes a decision - and I know that’s sometimes very difficult for the  current Government - but as soon as the Government has decided what it wants the Opposition will very  swiftly decide whether or not we can support that and if we lend it support, there’s no reason why it can’t go  expeditiously through the parliament.   

 QUESTION:   

 You keep bringing up about the anniversary, you seem very bitter about it still. Isn’t it just time to move on?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I think that it’s very important that governments deal honestly with the public and this is a  Government which said six days before the last election, “there will be no carbon tax under the government  I lead.” Now, it’s just not right for a Prime Minister to say one thing before the election to win votes and do  the opposite after the election to hold office. It’s just not right. Now, I’m standing up for decency in our  democracy. That’s the issue here. It’s not whether any particular individual is prime minister or whether any  particular party is in government. It’s about decency in our democracy and prime ministers who say one  thing to get elected then do another thing, the very opposite, to stay in office, I think bring our system into  disrepute.
