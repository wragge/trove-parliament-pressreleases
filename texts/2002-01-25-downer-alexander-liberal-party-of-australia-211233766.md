 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER

 FA11 25 January 2002

 VISIT TO THE UK, SPAIN, GERMANY, SWITZERLAND, POLAND AND RUSSIA

 I will travel to the UK, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Poland and Russia from 27 January to 8 February.  During the  visit I will pursue bilateral, regional and multilateral issues of concern to Australia, with senior Commonwealth and European leaders.  A key theme of my meetings will be the global security outlook, international cooperation against terrorism  and reconstruction in Afghanistan.

 In London, from 28 to 30 January, I will attend meetings of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and the Commonwealth Ministerial Committee on terrorism. Discussion will focus respectively on the Commonwealth response to developments in Zimbabwe and practical measures the Commonwealth can take to further international cooperation to combat terrorism.

 In Spain, from 30 January to 1 February, I will meet Foreign Minister Josep PiquÃ© in Madrid in his capacity as representative of the Presidency of the European Union.  The EU Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten, will also attend these talks, which will cover international security issues and major developments in our respective regions.  These discussions, which are part of my regular dialogue with each EU Presidency, will also review Australia’s relations with the European Union, our major trade and investment partner. 

 In Madrid I will launch an Aboriginal art exhibition, Ramingining, at the Reina Sofia Museum.  I will address members of the Spanish business community on the advantages of Australia as a trade and investment partner in the Asia Pacific region.  I will also address an audience of business and government representatives and students at the Australian Studies Centre at the University of Barcelona on the theme of Australia, Spain and the Asia Pacific.

 In Germany, from 1 to 3 February, I will attend the annual Munich Security Conference and participate in a panel discussion on global security issues with ministers, defence officials, members of parliament and experts from around the world..  During the conference, I also plan to meet the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union and High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Dr Javier Solana, to exchange perspectives on international and regional strategic issues.

 In Switzerland from 3 to 4 February, I will hold talks in Geneva with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson on a range of multilateral and bilateral human rights issues.  I will also meet with UNHCR to discuss Australia’s efforts to combat people smuggling in our region and international cooperation on refugee issues.

 From 4 to 5 February, I will visit Warsaw, Poland, for meetings with the Prime Minister, Leszek Miller, and Foreign Minister, Wlodsimierz Cimoszewicz.  The visit is timely given Poland’s forthcoming accession to the European Union when it will become one of the largest markets within the EU.  In addition to discussions on EU matters, I will also focus on Australia’s growing commercial links, increasingly close cooperation in areas of common

 interest in international security and political issues and the active role of the Polish community in Australia in promoting bilateral ties.

 I will visit Russia from 5 to 6 February at the invitation of the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov.  This will be the first visit by an Australian Minister since the inauguration of President Putin and his Government.  I will hold discussions on the range of Australia’s interests with Russia with key Ministers including the Defence and Foreign Ministers with a focus on international security matters.  Australia and Russia have shared interests in many aspects of the global security environment, not least due to our joint participation in the war against terrorism. The recent conclusion of a Space Cooperation Agreement is symbolic of the new, diversified and value-added basis we are building for our trade relations in the 21st century.
