 Court Refugee Ruling should be Accepted by Vanstone  The Democrats have called on the Immigration Minister to accept the full Federal Court judgement  handed down yesterday which ruled that the asylum seekers whose temporary protection visas  had expired could not be deported unless the Government proved their country of origin was safe.   

 Democrat Immigration spokesperson, Andrew Bartlett, said "This is very positive news for the  thousands of refugees in Australia who are currently living uncertain lives on temporary protection  visas.   

 "The Minister should indicate immediately that she will accept the courts ruling and convert all  refugees visas to permanent ones as soon as possible. Appealing the ruling will just waste more  taxpayers money and create more suffering and uncertainty for many refugees and their families.   

 "Under this ruling, they may now be able to qualify for permanent protection visas instead of being  forced to prove their refugee status once their three year visa expires.   

 "The Democrats have long opposed the introduction of temporary protection visas due to their  cruel nature of uncertainty which prevents asylum seekers from being able to put down roots and  to get on with their lives."   

 The ruling also means that any refugee who has been previously refused a permanent visa may  now reapply to the Federal Court.   

 The core of this appeal by an Afghan refugee was a challenge to the validity of DIMIAs  assessment that the overthrow of the Taliban Government meant that the country was safe to  return to.   

 "The fact that we are sending SAS troops back over to Afghanistan goes to show that country is  not safe and the government there cannot guarantee safety for returning refugees.   

 "The list of DIMIA bungles grows everyday, with another report emerging yesterday of the wrongful  search, interrogation and incarceration of a 21-year-old Bangladeshi man on a valid student visa.   

 "These latest events strengthen the Democrats long standing calls for fundamental reform of the  Migration Act. The culture of the Department cannot change unless the law and policies they are  administering changes."
