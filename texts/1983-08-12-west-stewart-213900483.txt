 Î¯ the Minister for Immigration  Ethnic Affairs. HON S J WEST MP

 12 August 1983

 KUALA LUMPUR, 12 August -The Australian Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West, today met with the Malaysian Acting Prime  Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, Datuk Musa Hitam, and 

 the Malaysian Minister of Education, Datuk Dr Sulaiman Bin  Haji Daud,  in Kuala Lumpur on 11 August. Mr West is  visiting Malaysia as a guest of the Malaysian Government.

 Amongst other things, the Indo-Chinese refugee situation  and Australia's policy on overseas students was discussed.

 Mr West said Australia appreciated the role adopted by  Malaysia in the provision of first refuge to Indo-Chinese  refugees.

 "This is an essential part of the international response by  resettlement countries such as Australia, U.S., Canada, and  France", he said.

 Since the refugee resettlement programme began, Australia  has taken about 32,000 refugees from Malaysia,  or about 18%'·  of the total number of refugees who have left Malaysia. In  the first six months of this year, Australia took 1,860 

 refugees or about 40% of the Malaysian total.

 "Australia is committed to a continuing steady programme  of resettling refugees from Malaysia as part of an inter­ national effort",  Mr West said.

 International cooperation was reaffirmed by the recent  meeting of resettlement countries (U.S.A., Canada,  Japan,  and Australia) in Honolulu.

 Mr West said it was most important that this international cooperation continue to apply to resettlement from Malaysia.  The UNHCR has been asked to accept an enhanced role in  planning and strategy for the future.  As part of that 

 strategy, the Australian Government sees the need for  policies which deter further outflow from Vietnam, including  the development of the orderly departure programme, and for  seeking means by which voluntary repatriation could be - 

 encouraged.
