 Over t h i s  t im e  strong  goodwill  and mutual  respect  have

 W e, for example , were pleased  as I mentioned  in my audience  

 with His Majesty  the King today , to have the Crown Prince  

 spend a number  of years t r a in in g  in Au s t r a l i a ,

 Wh i l e  Au st r alia n s  and Th a is  have d if f e r e n t  h i s t o r i c a l  and -

 CULTURAL TRADITIONS, WE HAVE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES IN COMMON,

 We BOTH HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND -  

 PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE IN OURSELVES, AND IN WHAT WE HAVE  

 DONE AND ARE DOING TO BUILD OUR OWN COUNTRIES.

 Co-o p e r a t i v e d e a l i n g s between Au s t r a l i a and Th a i l a n d

 EXTEND INTO MANY AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO EACH OF OUR 

 COUNTRIES, ‘ . ....

 There has been a st ea dy i n c r e a s e in trade between Au s t r a l i a 

 and Th a i l a n d,

 Our common i n t e r e s t s as commodity producers have seen us

 WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER -  FOR EXAMPLE, IN TRYING TO 

 ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT.

 Au s t r a l i a n a i d and in v e s t m e n t i s c o n t r i b u t i n g p o s i t i v e l y

 The effort s both Au s t r a l i a and Th a i l a n d are m a k i n g together 

 to p o l i c e an d, i n the long- term, to e r a d i c a t e the drug 

 trade are of c o n s i d e r a b l e importance to both our s o c i e t i e s,

 BOTH HUMAN AND MATERIAL TERMS, AftE c o n s id e r a b l e .

 Au s t r a l ia  and Th a il a n d  also have important  in ter ests  in

 And the i n t e r e s t s we share are i m po rta nt to the r eg io n as

 A WHOLE,

 Au s t r a l i a sees i t s own future as b e i n g i n d i s s o l u b l y l i n k e d

 WITH THE FUTURE OF THE REGION,

 Strong and close a s s o c i a t i o n s have been d e v e l o p e d between 

 Au s t r a l i a and c o u n t r i e s of the region i n such w i d e- ranging 

 areas as trade and two-way in v e s t m e n t, refugee a s s i s t a n c e

 AND RESETTLEMENT, DEFENCE CO-OPERATION, OVERSEAS STUDENTS 

 PROGRAMS, DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, BUSINESS, PROFESSIONAL AND 

 TOURISM LINKS,

 The s c a l e of t h i s Au s t r a l i a n in vo l v em en t w i t h the region

 SHOULD BE APPRECIATED,

 Tot a l Au s t r a l i a/ASEAN two- way trade i n 1982/83 was valued  

 AT $US 3.2 BILLION. TWO-WAY INVESTMENT WAS WORTH 

 $US 2.09 b i l l i o n  in the f i v e  years ÏÎ¿ 1982. 81,500 Indochinese

 REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RESETTLED IN AUSTRALIA -  29,000 OF THESE 

 RESETTLED FROM THAILAND. THERE ARE SOME 12,000 SOUTH EAST 

 As ia n  students  studying  in Au s t r a l i a . Au s t r a l ia n  a i d  to the 

 ASEAN countries  in 1983/89 w i l l  be worth in excess  of 

 $US 100 m i l l i o n . The Au s t r a l ia n  Defence  co- o peration  program  

 in the same year w i l l  contribute  more than $ US 20 m i l l i o n  to 

 the ASEAN c o u n t r ie s , not in c lu d in g  the cost of m a i n t a i n i n g  

 an RAAF squadron  at Butterworth . Some 235,000 Au s t r a l ia n  

 tourists  v i s i t e d  the region in  1982 - a major boost to the 

 economies  of  popular  destinati ons  such  as  T h a i l a n d .

 The depth and ex te nt of Au s t r a l i a ' s p a r t n e r s h i p  w i t h the 

 ASEAN c o u n t r ie s i s therefore c o n s id e r a b l e , and for our part

 WE ARE COMMITTED TO BUILDING ON AND EXTENDING I T ,  .

 It IS A PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY DEVELOPED 

 OVER MANY YEARS AND HAS NOW REACHED THE POINT WHERE |

 SUBSTANTIAL AUSTRALIAN AND REGIONAL INTERESTS ARE INTIMATELY 

 BOUND UP WITH ITS CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT,

 South Ea s t As i a i s s t r a t e g i c a l l y  important to Au s t r a l i a , 

 Au s t r a l i a  shares w it h the ASEAN countries  a strong  sense

 OF THE NEED TO MAINTAIN REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY,

 Au s t r a l ia  is deeply  concerned  by any developments  that might

 EITHER THREATEN REGIONAL SECURITY OR PUT AT RISK THE 

 TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND STABILITY OF REGIONAL COUNTRIES,

 IN THIS REGARD THE POSITION OF THAILAND IS ONE OF PARTICULAR 

 SENSITIVITY, ·

 Au s t r a l ia  recognises  t h is  and q u ite  d e l ib e r a t e l y  as a

 CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP ITS DEFENCE CO-OPERATION. 

 PROGRAM WITH THAILAND -  FROM ALMOST NOTHING FOUR YEARS AGO 

 TO APPROXIMATELY $US 4 MILLION THIS YEAR,

 W e intend  to m a i n t a i n  t h i s  commitment ,

 Au s t r a l ia  sees i t  as p a r t ic u l a r l y  important  that great

 POWER RIVALRY NOT DICTATE THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN THE 

 REGION.

 The projection  of So v i e t  influence  into the I ndochina  ,i

 S I T U A T I O N  HAS RENDERED THE TASK OF A C H I E V I N G  A SOLUTI ON 

 TO THE PROBLEMS OF THAT AREA I MMEASURABLY MORE D I F F I C U L T ,

 C O- OP E RAT I ON WI T H  I T S  NEI GHBOURS* .  A S ASEAN ITSELF PERCEIVES.

 What Au s t r a l i a  wants to see i s t h e ^ - e s t a b l is h m e n t  of ..

 CO-OPERATIVE WORKING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF

 I ndochina  and other r e g io n a l  countries  w it h  an at te n d a n t

 DIMINUTION OF GREAT POWER INVOLVEMENT.

 Au s t r a l i a ' s in t e r e s t  in d eveloping  a - relevant  r e l a t i o n s h i p  

 w it h  V iet n am  i s d ir e c t e d  towards  a c h ie v in g  t h i s .

 The Cambodian  s i t u a t i o n  i s o bv io u sly  the g r ea te st  unresolved

 SOURCE OF TENSION WITHIN THE REGION. .

 I t i s ALSO THE greatest  OBSTACLE TO THE n o r m a l is a t io n  OF · 

 r e l a t io n s  between  V ietn am  and it s n e ig h b o u r s .

 Au s t r a l ia  shares  ASEAN' s view  that " the c en tr a l  is s u e  in the 

 â¢Kampuchean  problem  is the s u r v iv a l  of the Kampuchean  n a t io n

 -AND THE -RESTORATION OF ITS INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY". .......  "

 Wi t h  ASEAN Foreign  Mi n i s t e r s  we agree t h at  " the to tal  withdrawal  

 of foreign  forces , the exer c ise  of s e l f - d e t e r m i n a t i o n , and 

 n a t io n a l  r e c o n c i l i a t i o n  are e s s e n t ia l  elements  for the 

 s u r v iv a l  of an independent  and sovereign  Kam puc hea " .

 7.

 1 1  Ï

 This i d e n t i t y  of view  between  Au s t r a l ia  and ASEAN stems d ir e c t l y

 FROM COMMON STRATEGIC PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS 

 OF REGIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.

 ON THE FUNDAMENTALS WE ARE AT ONE. 1

 I REITERATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S 

 CONDEMNATION, MADE REPEATEDLY BY BOTH ME AND THE AUSTRALIAN

 Foreign  Mi n i s t e r , of Vie t n a m ' s in v a s io n  and continued

 OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA.

 Wit h ASEAN we want to see an in d epen d en t , non- a l ig n e d  and 

 neutral  Ca m b o d ia , free of foreign  forces  and w it h  a 

 Government  of i t s  own c h o i c e .

 â¢ * +

 I n l i n e  w ith  t h i s , Au s t r a l ia  has been se ek in g  to promote  

 dialogue  between  the p a r t i e s , a dialo g u e  d ir e c t e d  towards  

 a c h ie v in g  Vietnamese  w ith d r aw al .

 W e have no il l u s i o n s  e it h e r  about  our own in flu e n c e  or

 THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED.

 There i s , for example , the concern  that many would share ,

 INCLUDING THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, THAT ANY WITHDRAWAL OF

 Vietnamese  forces  would provide  an o ppo rtunity  for the 

 forces  of Pol Pot once ag a in  to e s t a b l is h  the sort of 

 regime  which  terrorised  and t yr an n is ed  Cam bodia  t r a g ic a l l y

 for SO LONG.

 Such a development would be abhorrent to our Government

 AND THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA,

 He r e i n l i e s Au s t r a l i a ' s p a r t i c u l a r  d i f f i c u l t y  w i t h the 

 Cam bodian Re s is t a n c e Co a l i t i o n .

 Khmer Rouge involvement  w i t h the Co a l i t i o n  renders ,

 r e c o g n it io n  by Au s t r a l i a i m p o s s i b l e . It seems to us that 

 the apparent  predominance  of the Khmer Rouge w it h in  i t -  1

 notwithstanding  t h e. commendable  efforts  and in t e g r it y  of both 

 Pr ic e  Sihanouk  and Son Sann -  c ar r ies  with i t  the unacceptable  

 p o s s i b i l i t y  of the i m p o s it io n  of the Khmer Rouge in Ca m b o d ia .

 That prospect  does nothing  to j u s t i f y  continued  Vietnamese  

 occupation  of Ca m b o d ia .

 Rather  what i t does i s to p o in t  up the need for stepped  up 

 efforts  that would at once secure  Vietnamese  withdrawal  

 from Cambodia  and ensure  that the Khmer Rouge could n e v e r , 

 again  reimpose  themselves  as the Government  of that country .

 A p o l i t i c a l  settlement  of the Cambodian  problem  is the only 

 way such a result  can be secured .

 .Ul t im a t e l y  some b a s is  for d ialogue  may e x i s t  w i t h i n  the

 various  proposals  put forward  by both s id e s

 For e x a m p l e, Vi e t n a m' s recent references i n c o nv e rs a ti o n 

 w i t h Au s t r a l i a' s Fo r e i g n Mi n i s t e r to a p o s s i b l e conference 

 on Ca m b o d i a as a future development i n i t s current approach 

 and the Ap p e a l., i s s u e d by ASEAN Foreign  Mi n i s t e r s  in September , 

 in c lu d in g  a c all  for an in t e r n a t io n a l  conference  (not 

 nec essarily  under UN a u s p i c e s ) on the reconstruction  and 

 r e h a b i l i t a t i o n  of Cambodia  to follow  phased  t e r r i t o r ia l  

 Vietnamese  m i l i t a r y  withdrawal , are suggestive  of new and 

 p o s s ib l y  productive  l i n e s  of approach ,

 These developments , coming  as they do at the same t im e  as 

 ASEAN Foreign  Mi n i s t e r s  have formed  a Working  Group of

 OFFICIALS TO STUDY HOW BEST TO DEVELOP THE PROPOSALS IN

 t h e ir  20 September  a p p e a l , hold some hope of movement , i f 

 not im m e d ia t e l y , c e r t a in l y  w i t h i n  the foreseeable  f u tu r e .

 I should  l i k e  to t h i n k  Au s t r a l i a ' s i n i t i a t i v e  has contributed  

 in part to these  t e n t a t iv e  moves ,

 Au s t r a l ia  w i l l  continue  to do what i t can, as a country  . 

 with close r e l a t io n s  w ith  the ASEAN n a t io n s , w ith  the 

 Un it e d  States  and w ith  Ch in a  andh enjoying  useful  l i n k s  w ith  

 Vietnam , to provide  whatever  as s is t a n c e  m ig h t  be ap pr o pr iate  

 to the process  of f in d i n g  ways of a c h ie v in g  a durable  

 settlement  of the Cambodian  s i t u a t i o n .

 10 .

 AS IN THE PAST WE SHALL MAINTAIN THE CLOSEST CONSULTATION 

 WITH, AND SEEK THE UNDERSTANDING OF, ASEAN IN ANY STEPS WE 

 MAY CONSIDER IT APPROPRIATE TO TAKE.

 A PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING FEATURE IN INDOCHINA HAS BEEN 

 THE HUMAN SUFFERING ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFUGEE MOVEMENTS 

 CAUSED BY CONTINUING CONFLICT WITHIN THE AREA. ,

 Au s t r a l ia  has received  many of these unfortunate  people

 NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE FELT IT RIGHT AND HUMANE TO DO SO,

 BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS A MEMBER OF 

 THE REGION TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WHICH 

 HAS HAD ITS MAIN IMPACT IN THAILAND.

 Our CO-OPERATION IN THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MADE  

 NECESSARY BY THE REFUGEE SITUATION REFLECTS SOME OF THE  

 MOST DEEPLY-HELD VALUES OF OUR TWO SOCIETIES.

 I n t h i s  we have been m otivated  BY COMPASSION and '

 HUMANITARIAN CONCERN. AUSTRALIA HAS CONTRIBUTED OVER 

 $A 50 MILLION FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF CASH, FOOD 

 AID, AND PERSONNEL TO INDOCHINESE REFUGEES AND DISPLACED 

 PERSONS SINCE 1978, MORE ON A PER CAPITA BASIS THAN ANY 

 OTHER COUNTRY.

 C a m b o d i a n  p e o p l e , It also creates  c o n d it io n s  which  'â 

 reduce  the economic  in c e n t iv e  to leave  and to encourage  

 a movement  by the refugees  in the border  area to return  

 home. â 

 It w i l l  be e v id e n t  that Au s t r a l ia  .brings  an independent  

 carefully  considered  v ie w p o in t  to bear on developments  in the 

 r e g io n , The ASEAN countries  would not respect  us i f we d i d  

 not approach  the conduct  of our in t e r n a t io n a l  r e l a tio n s

 IN SUCH A WAY, NOR WOULD WE BE ENTITLED TO SUCH RESPECT.

 But, on the m ain  issues  of p r i n c i p l e , there is fundamental

 AGREEMENT. I n TERMS OF GIVING EFFECT TO THESE PRINCIPLES  

 THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIFFERENCES OF EMPHASIS, BUT  

 SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE HAS TENDED. TO BE OVERSTATED,

 Let me therefore  be clear and q u it e  u n e q u iv o c a l .

 Au s t r a l ia  i s not making  some k in d  of choice  between  our

 TRADITIONAL AND CLOSEST FRIENDS SUCH AS THAILAND AND THE 

 OTHER MEMBERS OF ASEAN ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE COMMUNIST

 Government  of V ietnam  on the o th e r ,

 Ra t h e r, i n s p i r e d  by the same hopes and concerns as our

 FRIENDS, WE WANT TO SEE PEACE IN A REGION WHICH HAS TOO ·

 LONG BEEN CHARACTERISED BY WARFARE, MISUNDERSTANDING AND 

 OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE. · '

 The d ee p, w i d e- ranging r e l a t i o n s h i p  which e x i s t s between 

 Au s t r a l i a and ASEAN should  provide  the framework  w i t h i n  

 which  we can address  such interests  and carry forward  ' 

 our shared  r e g io n a l  concerns  and preoccupations .

 De s p it e  the prominance  that has been given  in some quarters  

 to perceived  d iffer en c es  between  Au s t r a l ia  and the ASEAN 

 c o untries , I have f e l t  confident  at a l l t im e s  about  the 

 a b i l i t y  of the leaders  of our two countries  to c l a r i f y  these

 ISSUES SO THAT THE FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS 

 BETWEEN OUR NATIONS IS NOT ONLY NOT IN QUESTION, BUT CONTINUES 

 TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY STRENGTHENED.

 The talks  Bi l l  Hayden  and I have had with you M r Prime Mi n i s t e r  

 and with Foreign  Mi n i s t e r  Sid d h i  have confirmed  t h i s  .

 e x p e c t a t io n .

 Both Bi l l  Hayden  and I look forward  to furthering  t h is  

 process  w it h  other  ASEAN le a d e r s .

 13 .

 The frankness  and understanding  ac h ie ve d  between  us ar e,

 I BELIEVE, INDICATIVE OF THE STRENGTH AND QUALITY OF THE

 Au s t r a l ia n / T hai r e l a t i o n s h i p .

 You MAY BE ASSURED AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO STAND AMONG  

 Th a i l a n d ' s staunchest  f r i e n d s .
