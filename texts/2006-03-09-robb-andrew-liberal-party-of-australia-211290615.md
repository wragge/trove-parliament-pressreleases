 Iemma Wrong on Refugee Health

 9 March 2006

 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Robb AO MP, today  rejected comments made in the NSW Parliament yesterday by Premier Morris Iemma on refugee support services.

 ‘Mr Iemma needs to get his facts straight,’ Mr Robb said.

 ‘The Premier’s claim that refugees are denied a Medicare card is preposterous.

 ‘All refugees are permanent residents and have full access to Medicare, Centrelink and Job Network.’

 In fact, the Australian Government spends over $50 million each year providing on arrival services for refugee and  humanitarian entrants, ensuring they have access to on arrival reception and assistance, accommodation services,  information and referral services, torture and trauma counselling, translating and interpreting services and English  language services.

 Part of the orientation services include on arrival visits to health practitioners and follow up health screenings.

 ‘Mr Iemma’s remarks about the ‘whole community’ being at risk from illnesses such as tuberculosis betray a startling  degree of ignorance for someone in his position. I suspect Mr Iemma is trying to create a diversion to distract the  community from the serious problems his government faces.’

 The facts are that all refugees are screened for communicable diseases including tuberculosis at their initial health  screening and the majority are checked again at a pre-departure screen. The second pre-departure health check has been  progressively introduced by this government since August 2005. By August 2006, all refugees will receive a compulsory  second check prior to departure. No one with active TB is permitted to travel to Australia.

 Mr Iemma is well aware that the introduction of this second compulsory pre-departure health check is well advanced and  that as of February this year, 100 per cent of refugees from both East and West Africa, into New South Wales, have  undergone pre-departure health screenings.

 ‘This is just another example of the ALP engaging in xenophobic scare-mongering. Mr Iemma, of all people, should know  better,’ Mr Robb said.

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, wrote to the Premier on 16 December 2005  seeking his government’s views on the 2006-07 Refugee and Humanitarian program. To date - nearly three months later -  no reply has been received.

 ‘If Mr Iemma is so concerned about refugee support services, particularly, medical support services, why has he made  responding to Senator Vanstone’s letter such a low priority? Mr Iemma is just playing grubby politics,’ Mr Robb said.

 ‘Resettling refugees is a big challenge but all Australians should be proud of a program that offers support to some of the  most vulnerable people in the world to help rebuild their lives. The NSW Premier helps no one in giving preference to  uninformed rhetoric ahead of considered debate.’
