 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 MORRISON NEEDS TO COME CLEAN ON CAMBODIA 

 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has called on the Abbott  Government to come clean with the details of a refugee resettlement arrangement it is  negotiating with Cambodia.   

 It is completely unacceptable that the Australian people are forced to rely on the Cambodian  press for details about an agreement our Government is preparing to sign.    

 Today’s Cambodia Daily reports Immigration Minister Scott Morrison will visit Cambodia and  sign an agreement on Friday with Interior Minister Sar Kheng.   

 Scott Morrison needs to provide immediate information about what deal he is  about to do with Cambodia.   

 Mr Morrison must also explain why he believes Cambodia is an acceptable location for  resettlement when he so fervently denounced Labor’s Malaysia Arrangement.   

 Labor has serious concerns about Mr Morrison’s capacity to manage another regional  arrangement given his disastrous handling of the Regional Resettlement Arrangement with  Papua New Guinea.
