 PERTH PRESS CLUB SPEECH

 FoLLowing is the text of a speech by the Minister   for Foreign Affairs, Mr B ill Hayden MP, to the   Perth Press Club on Wednesday 14 November 1984:

 PERTH PRESS CLUB SPEECH

 Nearly two years ago, when Labor came to o f f ic e , i t  was  decided to galvanise our foreign policy from out of a torpor which  had lasted for eight years. I t  was decided to lead our foreign  policy forward out of a tim id ity  and subservience which had become 

 customary. I t  was decided to take the ad hoc-ery out of foreign  policy and plan its  development within a d e fin ite  framework. Quite  a change has followed these decisions.

 In the f i r s t  place, we attach pivotal importance to  maintaining sovereignty and a staunch independence in our  in ternatio nal relatio n s. We have awarded the highest possible  p r io r i t y  to expanding and consolidating arrangements for p o l i t i c a l , 

 cu ltu ral and (importantly) economic cooperation with countries in  our region. We strongly support the policy of seeking regional  solutions to regional problems, as d is tin c t from nostrums brought in  or imposed from outside.

 We do not agree that th is regional role and outlook have  only lip -s erv ic e  value. We Australians have observed our neighbors  emerge from colonialism and war into independence and development.  This development has led to p o lit i c a l and economic dynamism around 

 our region which is unmatched .around the world. We can not ignore  th is or hang back from i t .  We can not escape the challenge i t  o ffe rs. .

 Two imperatives, therefore, have nudged our fo re ig n  policy  in these new directions. One is the expectation of our neighbors '   that we pull our weight in the region. The other is the desire here  in Australia -  strengthened by our doleful experience of eight 

 flaccid  years -  that we take our own decisions on policies designed  with an eye f i r s t  and foremost on our own interest and security.

 The framework we have in mind for this foreign policy takes  in and integrates a range of issues including p o l i t i c a l ,  economic  and cu ltu ral matters. A dominant factor in this policy is a  vigorous and independent position on the great ( i f  not the  over-riding) issue of peace. We are working actively in a l l 

 possible situation for arms control and disarmament arrangments that  are tr u ly  e ffe c tiv e . In fa c t, we are making thorough going  nuisances of ourselves on the subject. We hold the strong view that 

 peace and security are best served by a system of international  arrangements, tre a tie s  and actions. · We are pressing this view as  energetically as we can at the United Nations, at the Disarmament  Conference at Geneva and in our direct contacts with other  governments. We w i ll continue to do so at the Security Council  where our membership for the next two years was supported by a  

 record vote at the UN last month.

 The philosophy behind this was put by John Curtin, one of  the architects of a foreign policy that was both essentially  Australian and essentially democratic s o c ia lis t. Labor challenges  poverty, he said; " I t  challenges the causes which lead to war; its

 purpose i s  paramountLy humanitarian; and i t  seeks to promote the   widest po ss ib le  scope f o r  men and f o r  women so t h a t  they can Live   ha pp ily  and c o n t e n t e d l y . "

 This statement does more than describe the o b j e c t i v e s  of   our p o l i c y ;  i t  a ls o  describes the ambit of  i t .  I  make the point in  

 parent he sis  because i t  seems to me a l o t  of people these p a r t i c u l a r   days have f o r g o t t e n  t h a t  -  as we know from the experience of   a c t u a l l y  governing -  ev ery th in g in government is  connected to   ever y th in g  e l s e .

 This is  the stre n gt h of the Labor P a r t y .  I t  is  the party  

 with ideas -  sometimes competing ideas -  but ideas about the whole   spectrum o f  p o l i c i e s  demanded by a complex n a t i o n .  This nat ion is   co n fro n ti n g  some severe questions at the moment: about s o c ia l support,  f o r  i n sta n c e ; new technology; unemployment and e s p e c i a l l y  

 r e gion al unemployment. the Government has been a t work on these   issues as w e l l  as -  and a t  the same time as -  ot h er great  

 imp eratives such as peace and disarmament. I  say work because (as I   have pointed out o f t e n  enough to people with genuine concern about   i t )  peace w i l l  not come from wishing f o r  i t  but by working at i t .

 The Government has been able to.work simultaneously on a l l  these   f r o n t s  because i t  stems from a p o l i t i c a l  pa rty  with a wealth of   ideas about how t o  improve the soci ety in  a l l  manner of ways:   making i t  j u s t ,  c o m fo rtab le , at peace with i t s  neighbours, confident  

 about i t s  long-term prospects.

 I  wonder how valua ble the Parliament would have been these   la s t  two y e a r s ,  by c o n t r a s t ,  i f  i t  had been f i l l e d  with MPs who had   got the re  on t h e i r  single-minded co n vic ti o n  about (say) p la n t   v a r i e t y  r i g h t s  but who had not an idea or even an interest in any  other of the matters that face government every working day. Income 

 supplementation, for instance, or equitable taxation or housing  finance; these are not exotica. When you are in government and  actually running the country, you have got to have ideas about these  things and disarmament and plant variety rights and hunger in  Ethiopia and a l l  the other issues which concern people.

 I have had the opportunity over the past few years to ta lk  to plenty of people who are preoccupied with these issues c)r_ with  land rights (to take another subject) _or with family law. They are  stimulating in that they are committed, and steeped in the issue  that preoccupies them. But they ar e depressing too in that th e ir 

 interest often stops right there, where th e ir  preoccupation ends. One admires th e ir  commitment. But the narrowness of th e ir  vision,  the lim it to t h e ir  judgement, th e ir lack of interest in the broad 

 sweep of issues c h i l l  the soul.

 I have to say that I exclude from these remarks the  Democrats in the Senate. They are there because they are there:  running hard on the soft options and running a mile from the hard  ones. They more than anybody else have obstructed the Government's 

 campaign against tax evaders so as to set up a f a i r  tax system. They less than anybody else have had the courage to o ffe r a detailed  tax system of t h e ir  own. I have watched the Democrats on

 3 . OOOZp

 the national p o l i t i c a l  stage for the past eight years, weaving   across to th is  side of the ideological divide when i t  is convenient   and then across to t h a t . The society can not be well served when   the Parliament is hostage to people who believe in so l i t t l e .  In   a l l  th e ir  time as an organised party, the Democrats have managed to   evade coming up with a consistent, workable, r e a l is t ic  program for   the m illio n  and one things which demand government atten tion every   day. I used to think the Democrats in the Senate were well-meaning  

 if. in effectu al people. Having observed th e ir  behaviour at close   hand over the past eight years, I believe them to be no more than   cynical and windy opportunists.

 To return to the ideas behind our p o lic ie s : we intend to tre a t our membership of the Security Council with the greatest  seriousness because of our active commitment to the prin cip le of   lib e rty  and order and progress through in ternatio nal organisations.

 One of the more worrying among current threats to these  objectives is the developing situation in and around Central  America. I t  was this -  plus the strong p o s s ib ility  that Australia  would be elected to the Security Council -  which led me to undertake   my recent v is it  to nations most d ire c tly  affected by events centring   on Nicaragua and El Salvador. Both are classic cases of the chaos  

 and distress which ensue when local problems are chewed up in the   m ill of great s trateg ic in terests. I t  is crazy and tragic that 

 international peace and security can be threatened by events in   countries that in themselves are so t in y . Yet th is  is the case with   Nicaragua and El Salvador whose chances of true independence and   economic ju stice are hostage to the play of greater in tere s ts. This  

 is the case with Costa Rica whose p a c ifis t t r a d it io n , which has been   an inspiration to so many people around the world, is subject to "   persistent pressure towards change.

 My observation of events in these countries, and   discussions with people d ire c tly  involved, have confirmed for me   that the Australian Government’ s policy towards the Central American   region is correct. This is that a l l  states there -  Nicaragua,

 El Salvador and everybody else -  should be free from interference  from outside forces. I t  is that a l l  states in the area should be  

 encouraged to go forward to the kind of p l u r a l is t ic  societies that   we take for granted. The best way to reduce the threat of arms in   the region is to reduce the l e v e l ,of confrontation, leaving the way   clear fo r badly needed p o lit i c a l and economic reform. The United  

 States has a legitim ate right to be concerned about security in   Central America. But we believe that th is concern should be   balanced with a real concern for the promotion of democracy,   p lu r a lis t ic  p o lit i c a l systems and economic progress in the region.

 Another development which could m ilit a t e  against global  security is much nearer home: the emergence of the Indian Ocean   region as a manoeuvring ground between great powers. I have pointed   out before the cogent reasons why we should keep a keen eye on this  development. One th ird  of the world's population live  in the Indian  

 Ocean region, very often in straitened economic and social  conditions. I t  has yet to build a strong and enduring framework of   regional cooperation. Many of the p o ten tial and actual .

 nuclear p r o life r a to r s  liv e  there. So the region has been awarded   the dubious d is tin c tio n  of becoming a s ig n ific a n t factor in  in tern a tio n a l p o l i t i c a l  and m ilita r y  considerations.

 This has obvious significance for Australia -  not only as a   nation with an in te re s t in world security arrangements -  but also as   a state with d ire c t economic and p o l i t i c a l  interests in the region.   Thus, we have legitim ate reason to be concerned with reducing   tension in the Indian Ocean area arising from the increasing role 

 and in terests there of the Superpowers.

 We observe with some interest in this context recent  developments in the the Soviet defence system. Defence expenditure   by the Soviet Union has been growing at only about two per cent a   year in real terms since 1976. But much of this spending has gone   on updating a l l  branches of the Soviet armed forces on th e ir  eastern   perimeter. The Soviet Union's Pacific fle e t is now the largest in  

 it s  navy. Both the q u ality  and quantity of it s  land forces have   been improved. I t  has upgraded it s  a ir  capacity, which now includes   the Blackjack bomber. I t  has introduced SS-20 medium range nuclear   missiles into this region. I t  has invested in considerable lo g is tic  and support capacity along the Vietnamese coast. All these  developments have considerable impact on the region and ( i f  I can   say so in passing) make i t  a l l  the more urgent that the Cambodian   problem be resolved and Vietnam's dependendence on the Soviet Union  

 reduced.

 So, because of these and prospective developments around   the Indian Ocean region, one of the f i r s t  tasks undertaken by the   Australian Government a fte r  it s  election was to assess and ( i f  necessary) to reactivate our relevant p o lic ie s . A main element in   th is  renewed policy is more vigorous support for the establishment   of the proposed Zone of Peace in the Indian Ocean. Other maj or   elements are as an a lliance partner of the United States continued 

 appropriate support for Western interests in the region; a more  r e a lis t ic  basis for allocating o f f i c i a l  aid there; and a greater 

 emphasis on pursuing A ustralia's own national interest as an  independent Indian Ocean l i t t o r a l  state resulting in a higher  p r o file  around the region. Since this policy re-assessment, we have  put renewed energy into the Zone of Peace project: as a member of  the UN Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean and in direct contact 

 with the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union. In  f a c t , Australian mediation played a large part in persuading the  United States not to withdraw from the Committee e a r lie r  this year.  We are working hard to support the UN decision that a conference be  held next year which w i ll work out ways and means to set up the Zone  of Peace.

 I have proposed -  following publication of the Jackson  Report -  that the Indian Ocean region should receive more attention  in our aid program. India especially should rate more highly in  this program than i t  has done. The Indian Ocean island states 

 should be put in the highest of the four geographical categories of  aid proposed in the Jackson Report as places o f special importance  to this country. The Government has set up a permanent High  Commission in Mauritius and posted a High Commissioner there, with  regular oversight resp onsib ilities in the other island states. We

 a r e examining t he  p o s s i b i l i t i e s  o f  a r o l e  f o r  the A u s t r a l i a n  Defence   Cooper ation Program in the region,  perhaps including the use of  train in g  in A u s tra lia .

 One result of our re-assessed policy which interests me  personally is the question i t  raises concerning past attitudes to  India and Pakistan, two of the most in flu e n tia l powers in the Indian  Ocean region. India is especially interesting in this respect. I t 

 has developed impressive m ilita r y  capacity, with the fourth largest  standing army in the world, the f i f t h  largest airforce and the  eighth largest navy. Its  navy is being upgraded to a blue-water  c a p a b ility . I t  has an advanced nuclear c a p a b ility . Excluding  Soviet bloc economies, i t  is in the Top 10 in the world economy,'  measured by Gross National Product. I t  is a leading producer of 

 such resources as petroleum products, thorium and iron o r e . Its  in d u s tria l and s c ie n tific  sectors are among the most advanced in the  world. I t  has an enormous pool of s c ie n t if ic , technological,  executive and professional t a le n t. Its  well-known problems of  economic development have helped obscure its  staggering performance 

 as an economy and as a democracy.

 A most s i g n i f i c a n t  point about In d ia  from A ustralia's point  of view is i t s  le adership  position in the Non-Aiigned Movement â This movement ( let i t  be remembered) is i t s e l f  a c r i t i c a l  factor in  the pursuit o f  s t a b ilit y  and security in the Indian Ocean region. I 

 have said before that i t  would be wrong to ignore the equally  legitim ate concerns of Pakistan in.the dynamically developing state  of a f f a ir s  in the Indian Ocean region. Pakistan considers i t s e l f  threatened by a powerful India. I t  faces considerable pressure from 

 a combination of events at home and abroad: from the presence of concentrated Soviet armed forces on its  western border, for  instance; from it s  strong apprehension that Soviet forces might be  tempted to clear a path to the Indian Ocean through its  t e r r it o r y ; 

 from the fact that i t  is host to extremely large numbers of refugees  from Afghanistan.

 The horrifying assassination of Mrs Gandhi and its  aftermath have added obvious complications to the situation of the  subcontinent. I have had the opportunity to meet Mrs Gandhi and I  had the highest regard for so many of her achievements. Her 

 leadership and vision were crucial elements in the progress of such  a diverse cu ltu ra l and social nation. We hope that the new Prime  M inister w i ll have the opportunity to exercise the same firm  leadership.

 I had in itia te d  the process which would allow me to v is it  India and perhaps other parts of the region some time next year. My  objective was to rejuvenate contacts which used to be so promising  but which had been permitted recently to lapse. With the tragic  death of Mrs Gandhi, the enormous tasks facing the new Indian Prime ·  M inister and the imminence of general elections in India, the 

 process of rejuvenating and reinvigorating the relationship may be  delayed somewhat. .

 But i t  is the Australian Government's intention to t r y ,  as  I  have said, to reactivate contacts with New Delhi. We certain ly  wish the Indian Government well in it s  present d i f f i c u l t  s itu a tio n .

 The Indian-Australian connection has been a long-standing  and frie n d ly  one. About 40 years ago, in the Evatt days, our two  countries collaborated in assisting the independence of Indonesia.  We provided a primary impetus in the establishment of the Colombo 

 Plan. To be sure, we have also had our disagreements. Indeed, a  central reason for the desire by Australia for a more active contact  with India is our concern at In dia's a ttitu d e  towards the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty which (in our considered view) is easily  the most e ffe c tiv e  arms control arrangement in operation.

 I t  is well known that India exploded a nuclear device in  1974. I t  has to be said, I  am a fra id , that India has not been 

 p a r tic u la r ly  helpful to A ustralia's strong position on arms control  and disarmament. I t  has not accepted the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  I t  has opposed attempts to prohibit so-called peaceful nuclear  explosions. We have shared the region's high interest in some 

 remarks in this context by one of In dia's leading s tra te g is ts , Dr  Subrahmanyam. He is reported to have made statements to a  conference in Canberra e a r lie r  this year which can only be regarded  as unhelpful to regional comfort and security. There is no reason, 

 he said, "why symmetric nuclear capability should not s ta b ilis e  the  situation in the subcontinent, as has happened in the industrialised  world and along the Sino-Soviet border."

 The Indian Government has indicated that i t  does not share  Dr Subrahmanyam's view and I  must say quite emphatically that we  also disagree with such attitudes which, in our view, cannot be in  the interests e ith e r of the Indian Ocean region or of the  Non-Aligned Movement. Australia has pointed out it s  views on  In d ia 's  nuclear policy to the Indian Government and has engaged the 

 Indian Government in a dialogue aimed at bringing about e ffe c tiv e  international arms control and disarmament arrangements. We w ill  continue to do so in a determined and constructive way.

 This is the essence of our foreign policy: that i t  be 

 s tu rd ily  independent in the interests of A ustralia. The corollary,  n a tu ra lly , is that we must be consistently honest and open in our  dealings with, other states, whoever they may be. We must be  consistently open and honest in our part in developments affecting  our security and in te re s ts , whether or not they are created or  encouraged by friends.

 The Australian Government holds the view strongly that our  policies must re fle c t the fact that the Asian, Pacific and Indian  Ocean areas are part of our environment. They are our home too.  Since the day i t  assumed o f f ic e , therefore, i t  has committed i t s e l f 

 to developing closer regional associations, building on regional  cooperation and resisting developments which threaten regional  security and s t a b i l i t y .  . The objective of this firm policy is.  support for the interests of the region as a whole and protection of  the interests and wellbeing of Australians in p a rtic u la r.
