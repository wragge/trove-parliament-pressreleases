 Check Against Delivery

 Ladies and Gentlemen. Friends. Good morning.

 You have heard today about our nation's achievements in the past 100 years.

 What is clear is that immigration has played an enormous role in developing our nation's economy, society and culture.

 It has changed how we see ourselves, and it has changed forever our place in the world.

 It continues to support our trade push into Asia and beyond, and it underpins our role in the global flow of people and ideas that is revolutionising our economy.

 Today I would like to concentrate on the challenges I believe we face if we are to ensure that immigration plays an equally significant role in our future.

 Key Themes

 I want to put to you three essential propositions:

 First, too many people and places are missing out on a fair share of economic opportunity, and do not feel as though they have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Second, unless we empower these people and places, and start to reflect what they actually want from government, an agenda of openness and higher immigration cannot be assured. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 And third, our diversity can strengthen both our economy and our democracy, but only if we have the courage to see our future through the eyes of hope rather than fear. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I will argue that these three factors are all related, and that for immigration to be the force for nation-building in the next century as it has been in the past, our politics needs to mature.

 Political Context

 Over the past five years, I believe that one over-riding reality has swamped our domestic politics.

 Too many people and places are missing out on a fair go.

 Not only are they missing out on economic opportunity and access to decent services, but they do not feel like they have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives.

 They feel powerless in the face of change, and receive very little support in the process of change.

 In short, they do not feel like their national government is on their side.

 This is not something that is unique to regional Australia - this sentiment is just as strong in the outer suburbs of our capital cities.

 It is a widespread disaffection with the Howard Government, and with politics more broadly.

 As is usually the case, it has provided fertile ground for the traditional scapegoating - where issues of immigration soon become a target.

 Some of our politicians have not had the courage to confront those concerns.

 Friends,

 I urge you to consider this.

 We will not realise the full contribution of immigration to nation-building unless we do more to empower the people and places that have been left behind by the Howard Government.

 Our policies must reflect the bread and butter concerns of ordinary Australians - in the key areas of education, health and jobs.

 It is tempting to take from the growing disaffection with politics the conclusion that there are many in our country who are simply racist and backward-looking.

 But that would be to sell short not only those people, but also ourselves. We have to understand that change is not working for many in our society.

 For the 16 year old kid who leaves school, and gets caught up in a world of unemployment, drugs and crime, change is not working.

 For the migrant woman in my electorate, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, who is retrenched because her TCF factory has closed down, change is not working.

 For the 45-year-old farmer, who finds that the farm is no longer viable, change is not working.

 The truth is that many of these people are not equipped to deal with change.

 We have not previously given them the skills and support networks that they now need.

 Under the Howard Government, we have gone backwards in our investment in education, training and research.

 And this has been felt at every level of education.

 And this is at a time when other countries have been expanding their investment in these areas.

 Kim Beazley has long said that he wants to be the Education Prime Minister, and Labor has already released a number of policies in this area.

 Our Education Priority Zones explicitly recognise that we have to do more for the places missing out, and will support local strategies in those regions where our kids are not staying on at school.

 We have said that struggling government schools are more in need than the handful of elite city private schools, and we will reallocate funding in line with that view.

 Parents know that there are few matters more important to a quality education than a quality teaching profession.

 Our Teacher Development Contracts will improve the skills of our existing teachers, especially in maths, science and IT.

 And new Teacher Excellence Scholarship will make our smartest kids the teachers of the future.

 In the area of training, we have stressed that we need to attend to the skills of people before they become unemployed, and we have committed to doing just that.

 We have pressured the Government to increase the training effort associated with Work for the Dole and the Job Network - and the Government is just starting to cave in to that pressure.

 We have committed to giving our regional universities affordable access to high-speed bandwidth, and will give them additional research places.

 We have driven the debate to make Australia a world leader in online learning - through the Learning Gateway and 100,000 places with the University of Australia Online.

 From Opposition, Labor is driving the debate about how we become a Knowledge Nation.

 Regional Development

 One of my portfolio responsibilities is for regional development. In one sense, my job is made easier by the fact that the Howard Government does not believe in regional development.

 When the Howard Government came into office in 1996, it abolished the Office of Regional Development, abandoned all regional development programs, and declared that there is no role for our national government in regional development.

 What this has left us with is a two-speed economy.

 While some parts of the nation have gone ahead, others have been left behind - with unemployment rates well into double figures.

 Aside from walking away from regional economic development, assistance to up-skill the unemployed has also been slashed.

 It was not surprising that last week's so-called welfare reform went down like a lead balloon.

 Here was the Howard Government, having cut $2.1 billion a year from labour market assistance, putting back $190m a year (less than 10%) and calling it the biggest commitment in decades.

 Economic opportunities and jobs are what matter to the people and places missing out, not rhetoric.

 People want to start to see governments that are accountable to them.

 They do not want to see the usual sweep of pre-election promises and attempts to buy votes.

 They want honesty, and a genuine commitment to be on the side of ordinary Australians, their families and their communities.

 Kim Beazley's Budget Reply made some important comments about that particular point. I will run through just a few examples.

 Labor opposes higher tax concessions for donations from big business to political parties, and will reallocate the saving to rolling back the GST on charities.

 Labor opposes the Commonwealth giving $105m to elite city private schools that benefit only a handful, and will reallocate that saving to struggling government schools and the quality of the teaching profession.

 Labor opposes the extent to which taxpayer money is wasted on political advertising and consultancies, and will reallocate that saving to the Fight Against Cancer, and to ensuring that people can gain access to medical assistance 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

 These fully-costed policies follow on from what we have already announced.

 We have said that our banks have social responsibilities, and unlike the government, we are prepared to make the banks meet their obligations.

 We have argued for a stronger public interest test, so that National Competition Policy is about jobs and regional development, not just narrow economics.

 We have always argued that Telstra, our largest national company, should be used for nation-building rather than be privatised.

 A few years back, Peter Reith has this to say: "never forget the lessons of history - we're on the side of making profits".

 Well, Labor's message now is equally clear - there is an alternative.

 Labor will put people before profits, and communities before corporate interests.

 And we are doing that because we are listening to what the people want.

 We have put education, health and jobs at the top of our list, because people are telling us that these are the things that matter.

 For the past five years, the Howard Government has neglected the real concerns of Australians, and has done nothing to give people a chance to share in economic opportunity.

 As a result, too many people and places have been left behind.

 For the past five years, our national government's vision has been for an unfair and complex tax - a tax that has sent our economy backwards, cost jobs and left the vulnerable in our society feeling even less secure.

 As a result, we have failed to look to the future.

 You may be wondering why I am raising these matters in a forum about immigration.

 I am raising them because I don't believe the role of immigration in nation-building is set in stone.

 I believe it is what we make of it.

 Unless we confront real issues underlying political discontent, we will not win the public's support for an agenda of openness, higher immigration and modernisation.

 We need to give people a voice if we are to get the most from our democracy, and start to address the things that really matter to them.

 The Strength of Our Diversity

 Much of the immigration debate is about how we are changing as a nation.

 It is a debate that stirs up passions and emotions, and one where the rhetoric can very easily swamp the reality.

 In my view, immigration is not a debate of extremes, and for the reasons I've outlined, not a debate to be seen in isolation.

 It is part of a broader agenda of active citizenship - where all people are given real opportunity to participate and prosper in our society.

 It is also part of a broader agenda that seeks to reconcile our past, present and future, and come to discover for ourselves who we are, and our role in the world.

 Reconciliation

 Last week, Kim Beazley announced Labor's response to the Bringing them Home, the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families.

 In his response, Kim made three main commitments towards reconciliation:

 A national apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, in the first sitting week of a new Parliament; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A national conference to examine methods of resolving the consequences of forced removal of Aboriginal children;and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Monitoring and annual reporting to Parliament by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on the progress of the implementation of the recommendations of the Bringing them Home Report.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I believe these measures are an important element in our nation coming to terms with who we are, and the sort of nation we want to be. Alongside our attitudes to immigration and diversity, they will help to define us.

 Immigration Program

 Labor favours an increase in immigration - this was a position Kim Beazley committed to when Pauline Hansonfirst raised her loathsome agenda, just as the Howard Government was running and ducking those peddling the politics of fear.

 Our past experience of immigration has shown us that people who commit to making new lives in Australia contribute a lot more to our nation than economic measures can capture.

 Our family reunion program recognises that we have an obligation to respect the circumstances, including the family circumstances, of people that become part of our nation.

 Our humanitarian program recognises that we are still relatively lucky, and that we openly accept our moral obligations to fellow human beings when they face persecution and oppression in their native lands.

 We currently face a situation where our ability to attract skilled migrants, in a competitive global market is affected by what we offer those migrants in terms of family reunion arrangements.

 For skilled people to come to Australia, and stay here, we need to offer them a reasonable opportunity to maintain their family links.

 Labor is examining ways to attract skilled migrants and businesses (and their families) to the regions.

 We believe this has the potential to not only contribute to regional development, but hopefully to break down the misconceptions many people have about immigration.

 And in seeking to attract migrants to the regions, we appreciate the need for settlement and ethnic-based family and community services.

 Labor at the last election committed to ensuring that community organisations that address the needs of new migrants and refugees, such as Migrant Resource Centres, received guaranteed funding over three years.

 While skilled migration can contribute to our economic development, we cannot make the mistake of seeing it as a substitute for retraining our existing workforce.

 Where it has been used for that purpose, such as in the building industry, it has undermined the public's confidence in the integrity of the system.

 Population Policy

 One of my responsibilities is to look at how immigration affects our population levels.

 Population policy is broader than immigration alone - it also goes to issues of fertility, the ageing of our population, regional development and sustainability.

 Labor in government will establish a new Office of Population to research and advise on the range of population options and ways of getting there.

 The first step will be to undertake a wide-ranging inquiry to ascertain the levels of population that can be sustained into the long-term in order to pursue more favourable economic, social, and environmental outcomes.

 The Office will play a leadership role in encouraging a wider public understanding of population issues, and an open and honest debate.

 We need an open debate, underpinned by strong leadership, to maintain public confidence on immigration and population issues.

 Labor believes a larger population can culturally enrich us, assist us to achieve our economic objectives, help build our cities and regions, and help us to meet new challenges as our population ages in coming years. Where to from here?

 A sorry aspect of the recent Australian debate is that we still do not talk with pride of our cultural richness and diversity.

 It is time to shift our language from tolerating diversity, to valuing it.

 Immigration has played an enormous part in developing our economy, our society and our culture. If it is complemented by an agenda that attends to the concerns and aspirations of all Australians, it can continue to play that vital role.

 Between Fear and Hope

 There is much at stake in us getting this agenda right.

 A fortnight ago, I attended the National Farmers Federation Annual Dinner.

 The keynote address was by John Howard.

 What struck me was that the entire speech was about how the GST had been good for the economy, how we needed to protect our national borders, and how a Howard Government would never give in on issues such as reconciliation, the republic and immigration.

 I felt like I was back in the 1960s.

 But also within the last month, I was in Melbourne for our centenary celebrations.

 I was fortunate to be present for the comments that came from 15-year-old Sydney schoolgirl Hayley Eves during that event.

 Before 7000 people in the Royal Exhibition Building - and before a massive live television audience -she had this to say:

 "I am young, I am a woman and I am Asian Australian. That I am standing in front of you demonstrates clearly that we have changed." âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I believe more Australians were listening to what Hayley had to say - about a nation maturing - than

 about John Howard's politics of fear.

 My friends,

 It is now about four or five years since Martin Krygier delivered his Boyer Lecture, where he described Australia as a nation caught somewhere between Fear and Hope.

 It is a tension we are still struggling with.

 If we are to maintain support for an agenda of hope rather than fear, we need to do more for the people and places currently missing out, and we need to listen to what people actually expect from government.

 If we do these things, we have every chance of portraying our diversity as a key part of our national identity, rather than a threat to it.

 What we have in the Howard Government is a government that has held us back, a government that has lost touch with the concerns and aspirations of our people, and a government that has no vision for our future.

 I believe that the hearts and minds of the Australian people are maturing faster than the hearts and minds of this government.

 The great thing about that maturity is that it is demanding more from governments.

 If our people and our government can rise to that challenge, I believe we are on the verge of exciting times.

 If we rise to the challenge, our future will involve us exporting new products in new industries, for new consumers in new markets. And we will be doing so using new technologies and new skills.

 If we rise to the challenge, we will be equipped to deal with the global flow of people and ideas as a matter of course.

 If we rise to the challenge, we will see our diversity as a key element of our national identity, rather than a threat to it.

 But none of this is a given - and it will take leadership today to get us where we want to be tomorrow.

 As a nation, we have much to be optimistic about.

 We are a diverse society, and our people demand a democratic voice.

 We are one of the most multi-lingual, multicultural nations in a world where our ability to engage with other nations matters more than ever.

 We are in close proximity to the fastest growing region in the world.

 We have a tradition of immigration, of creating new ideas and of adapting the good ideas of others.

 Supported by good government, our traditions are capable of sustaining the transition to a Knowledge Nation.

 Supported by good government, our desire to improve the lives of our people and our nation is capable of

 ensuring that the politics of hope will yet prevail.

 Thank you.
