 Speech to Industrial Relations Society of Victoria 

 

 

 To say that we have just witnessed an interesting election is somewhat of an understatement. And  I've probably had one of the more unusual first few weeks in the new job. But I think if anything can  train you for high-stakes multi-party negotiations with people you've only just met, it's being a  Victorian industrial lawyer. So it is a great pleasure to be back here and talking to many people I  have worked with in one form or another. It's an honour to be asked to speak at the start of the  day's proceedings. 

 As a good industrial lawyer, I'm not going to tell you about the content of any of the negotiations.  But I think I'm probably not breaching any confidences when I tell you that in my first meeting with  Bob Katter, he said to me 'You may be the Green in Parliament, but I'm the anti-Green'. I'm pleased  to report that although he now sits within arm's reach of me in the chamber, to date we have  managed to keep Parliament a kinder, gentler place. 

 It is notable that during the election campaign, industrial relations didn't feature anywhere near as  strongly as in 2007. The Your Rights at Work campaign - one of the most successful campaigns in  recent political history - was absent. To the extent industrial relations appeared, it was a fear  campaign against Tony Abbott. For all intents and purposes, the Fair Work Act was not criticised at  all in the public sphere during the election campaign. 

 However, The Greens and a number of individual unions and others were arguing before and during  the election campaign that the change of government in 2007 had not brought with it the change in  industrial regulation many of us were hoping for. For although in some important respects the new  regime of industrial law is better, it is still unfair. 

 I have some experience in this field, as I have referred to. I was a solicitor for 10 years,  representing workers and their unions, and was a partner in the industrial & employment unit of a  major national law firm. I was an accredited specialist in workplace relations law and more recently  a barrister working in the field. All in all, I've practiced in this area from 1997 to 2010, a period that  has spanned some significant changes and events. 

 It is a field I have very much enjoyed working in and it is with great pleasure that I can announce  here today that I will continue my engagement with the field as The Greens' national spokesperson  on Employment and Workplace Relations. 

 I inherit the mantle from Senator Rachel Siewert who has worked tirelessly to advance Greens  principles in Parliament. Thanks to her, we have in the Fair Work Act the right for carers to request  flexible work practices to look after people with people a disability. She has also kept alive the issue  of the unfairly coercive laws operating in the building and construction industry, as well as the  failure of successive Labor and Liberal governments to ensure their laws comply with International  Labour Organisation conventions. They are truly big shoes to fill and I acknowledge the great work  she has done. 

 As we enter a Parliament where from 1 July 2011 The Greens will have the balance of power in The

 Senate in our own right and where we are sharing it in the lower house, this will be a significant  responsibility. We will continue to try to make the Fair Work Act fairer. Given the topic of this  conference, I'll use my time today to point to some of the unfairness embodied in Labor's legislation  and then to briefly outline the approach we'll be taking to matters work related. 

 I mentioned earlier that industrial relations only appeared briefly during the election campaign in  the form of a fear campaign against Tony Abbott. This prompted Tony Abbott to announce that he  would not make any changes to workplace relations legislation. There then followed a further push  to show that there were nonetheless significant changes he could make without requiring legislative  amendment. The ACTU announced that it had 'found 198 ways that Abbott could make changes  through regulations or ministerial power'. From this we were asked to conclude that workers  shouldn't vote for the Coalition. 

 But in fact the ACTU analysis had demonstrated potentially how weak the Fair Work Act actually is.  It showed that so many aspects of protection of rights at work can be undone with the stroke of a  pen. This is a first fundamental concern with the legislation: it embodies a much broader trend  away from broad based guaranteed protections and towards much more contingent forms of  regulation. Why didn't a Labor government enshrine basic protections for workers in legislation and  thus make these protections harder to remove? And why wasn't Labor being criticised for it? One of  the consequences of the composition of the current House of Representatives will hopefully be a  reinforcing of the supremacy of parliament over the executive. With that should come a salutary  reminder that protections that are reliant on the goodwill of a Minister have far less permanence  than those enshrined in law. 

 A second and related area of concern is the award modernisation process. I stress that my  comments in this respect are directed to the legislative framework, not the tribunal or officers who  are doing as one would expect by implementing the law. Because of the legislative framework, we  witnessed a largely administrative (as opposed to quasi-judicial) process of review of decades of  guaranteed entitlements. The legislation enabled the Minister to provide written direction to the  AIRC (later FWA) to create many new awards in a very tight timeframe and to then modify those  requests along the way, sometimes on the basis of successful political lobbying engaged in outside  of the tribunal. The AIRC's process was one of conferences and oral submissions, not contested  evidence. New awards were created in a very short time frame. These new awards almost always  contained fewer provisions than the ones previously applying, and those old awards in turn had  been through a previous process of simplification under the Howard legislative regime. And these  new awards all contain provisions enabling the legislative floor to be varied on an individual basis. 

 I mentioned the award simplification process under the Workplace Relations Act. That was  colloquially referred to as 'award stripping' and was roundly criticised and challenged as far as the  High Court when it was driven by Howard and Peter Reith. The award modernisation process, by  contrast, was hastened along with the assistance of many. The Greens have for some time drawn  attention to the loss of conditions and entitlements and the fundamental inequities in the process. I  know also from my experience that some in the union movement have watched with something  approaching simmering resentment at the administrative and executive acts that combined to  remove their legislatively guaranteed entitlements. To rub salt into the wounds, at least under  Howard and Reith workers and their unions had the capacity to lead and test evidence and make  oral submissions on the basis of that evidence before their conditions were removed by the  tribunal. Under Labor's framework, no such rights are enshrined, and in some cases decades of  protection are removed with the tribunal not having heard any evidence from the employees who  will be affected by their decision. 

 Thirdly, there are those many sections of the Fair Work Act that are lifted almost word for word  from the Workplace Relations Act: the prohibition on employers and employees bargaining at the  industry or sector level if they so choose; the restrictions on the right to organise in the form of

 cumbersome secret ballots; the unfair restrictions in industrial action introduced by John Howard to  tilt the playing field unfairly in favour of employers;Â  and the interference in free bargaining by  prohibiting people from agreeing on matters such as right of entry or social and environmental  matters that do not fall within the narrow purview of matters pertaining to the employment  relationship. These have all been the subject of repeated criticism by the ILO. When they were  introduced by Howard, there were howls of protest but then we watched them pass almost without  comment - with a few notable exceptions - into the Fair Work Act. 

 In short, Fair Work is cast from the same mould as WorkChoices. Many gains made by workers and  their unions over a century will be removed in the name of 'simplification' or 'modernisation'. The  freedom to bargain is restricted, with complex prohibitions remaining on the level, subject matter  and style of bargaining available to parties. The restrictions on internationally recognised rights to  organise and take industrial action are lifted almost word for word from the old legislation. Fair  Work Australia's discretion to resolve disputes remains constrained, continuing Howard's  transformation of the tribunal from one that would settle disputes and their underlying causes into  one who simple orders disruption cease, leaving the underlying causes of that disruption  unresolved. Under both WorkChoices and Fair Work, the tribunal is being moved from umpire to  police officer. 

 Of course, it is to be welcomed that under new arrangements AWAs are no longer in existence, but I  note that there are now individual flexibility arrangements and the right to effectively vary  enterprise agreements and awards in some respects, provisions which need to be watched with  great interest to see how they operate in practice. The new provisions around unequal pay are a  vast improvement and we will await with interest the outcome of the current applications before  Fair Work Australia. And it must be said that for some employees in hard to organise industries, the  situation is better under Fair Work than WorkChoices, with new provisions offering unions the  capacity to seek a spot at the bargaining table. However, once at the table, such workers will find  the bar set pretty low for what constitutes an acceptable deal. Whilst the uniform protections in the  National Employment Standards are in principle welcome, they are a shadow of the guarantees that  would have been available had, for example, existing awards been made common rule.Â  

 John Buchanan said that with WorkChoices the sky didn't fall in but the floor began to rot. Under  Fair Work, instead of re-stumping the house and putting down new floorboards, Labor has simply  installed steel grating: enough to stop you falling further but hardly comfortable enough to live on.Â  

 These changing patterns of labour regulation, together with significant global and local changes in  the way business and labour are configured, has led us to a situation Sydney University's Workplace  Research Centre has recently described as one where workers and those close to them are  increasingly absorbing the risks of a globally interconnected economy and where, as the ACTU  President has said, 'the wages share of national income is now at its lowest point since December  1964'. 

 It would be somewhat disingenuous to claim that this state of affairs is simply the result of  employers getting their way. More often than not, the changes to labour market regulation and the  organisation of work have had the express support of both major parties and sometimes union peak  bodies as well. Indeed, we are now bearing witness to the consequences of a three-decade long  bipartisan love affair with neoliberalism and deregulation. 

 The Fair Work Act embodies all the elements of neoliberalism. A supposed commitment to the free  market of bargaining, but backed up with harsh consequences for those who don't bargain the right  way and a massive government-sponsored intervention to ensure employees permanently  negotiate with one hand tied behind their back.

 Workers and their families and dependents are absorbing enormous amounts of risk as part of this  process. This is in turn causing enormous stress. The Workplace Research Centre's research is a  powerful critique of where Labor's single-dimensional approach is taking us: a society of working  harder, postponing retirement, taking on more risk, having weaker safety nets and less capacity to  enjoy our leisure time and families. 

 I commend the ACTU for commissioning the WRC research and the ACTU President for giving such  strong voice to it in her National Press Club speech. The subject matter expressed reflects many of  the concerns that The Greens and I have been articulating for some time about the unsustainability  and unfairness of current arrangements. 

 As The Greens, there are some important philosophical underpinnings to our approach to industrial  relations. I'll talk about them in a moment. But I want to first draw attention to another aspect of  something that will benefit all participants in the field of work. Much of the discussion about  industrial relations reform over the years has taken place in a largely evidence-free environment.  When I was practising as an industrial lawyer, it became almost folklore that the removal of unfair  dismissal laws would result in an employment boom. The so-called Centre for Independent Studies,  for example, was still reporting in 2002 thatÂ  'A survey conducted ... in 1999 found that 54% of  small business employers might have hired more employees over the previous 12 months had it not  been for the unfair dismissal laws.' (  http://www.cis.org.au/media-information/opinion-pieces/article/1356-unfair-dismissal-laws-deter-firi  ng-and-hiring- [1])Â  The results of a survey apparently asking the very broad question of whether  one 'might have employed' someone instantly became near gospel, repeated ad nauseum,  including in political debate. 

 I am concerned that the debates around 'flexibility' and so-called 'work/life balance' in particular  could head down the same path. Although I have spent much of this speech talking about the  downsides of a flexibility driven from above, I am also acutely aware that the situation is more  complicated. Much of the move is attributable to a real desire to take back some control of our  working lives. To be able to do things inside of working hours that we were previously only able to  do outside of them. And reflective of the fact that many of our labours are now taking place in an  increasingly interconnected world and in the realms of communication, many of us don't want to be  stuck in an office if we can do the work at home or elsewhere. 

 But this brings with its own set of problems, from aggrieved partners and family members to a  sense that it is simply impossible to escape work at all. To grapple with this new world, we'll have to  start rethinking how to understand the relationship between work and non-work, between paid  labour and the labour we don't get paid for. And we'll need to properly understand what is  happening to people when the financialisation and risk referred to by WRC intersects with low  availability of childcare, increasing health costs and congested roads. 

 More and sustained research is essential. A priority should be the establishment of research at a  national level that will not be subject to the vicissitudes of the political cycle, but will tell us in some  depth and over a decent amount of time how work is changing. 

 Now, during the course of the campaign, as is probably well known, The Greens received some  valuable support from some unions. They were, I believe, attracted not just to our principled stand  on industrial relations, but also the recognition that there are many and better jobs in the transition  to a sustainable & clean energy future. The countries that will do well in the 21st century are those  who grasp the transition with both hands, recognising the enormous opportunities.

 However, The Greens are not simply about adopting the policies of one group and making them our  own. Further, unlike the Labor Party, our structure is member-driven and grassroots, with no  capacity for third-party organisations - like unions - to affiliate. As such, we cannot be accused of  being beholden to any particular sector. Instead, our platform is based around the four pillars of our  party: social justice, grassroots democracy, environmental sustainability and peace and  non-violence. 

 Our policy platform is comprehensive and available on our website. We will stick to it when voting in  Parliament. 

 But in what is also a time for reflection about "where to from here" in the field of industrial  relations, we will approach the shifting circumstances of this changing world of work by remaining  grounded in the values that have guided The Greens for many years and seen our support grow to  the point where more than 1 in 9 people in Australia voted for us at the recent election. During my  first speech to parliament last week, I spoke of the importance of these values of sustainability,  compassion and equality. 

 Real sustainability means thinking again about how we live every aspect of our lives. Many people  for many years have been leading the way, showing us that a green life is a healthier, happier and  more secure one, where a global outlook means bonds of the local community are strengthened.  These ideas are well and truly breaking out of the private realm and taking their place firmly on the  national political stage. Ã¢ÂÂ¨But sustainability also offers the right prism for viewing the current  tensions that sometimes go under the moniker of 'work/life balance'. Tracey from the WorkChoices  ads - the harried mother on the phone to her employer - was so successful because she epitomised  what so many feel: stretched between so many obligations, unable to enjoy life because of work's  insecurities and intrusions, having no real control and feeling that things can't go on like this. In  other words, reflecting the nagging feeling many of us have that this way of structuring our lives is  unsustainable. We now have to think about how to shift this. 

 Compassion is vital not just in our treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, but in thinking about  our economy. If we're serious about talking about women working after they've had children, for  example, then we need to be talking about childcare availability at the same time, which in turn  means investing in childcare workers and facilities. And with an aging population, with the health  threats posed by climate change, with the increasing risks being absorbed by the workforce, we  should have a debate about whether we move 'care' to centre stage when considering how we will  structure our economy. 

 Equality is more important now than ever. We now don't even blink at treating some people as less  equal than others.Â  There are so many exceptions to the principle of full equality that the exception  is becoming the rule. We all have the right to get married, unless your partner is of the same  gender. We pride ourselves on our great sovereign nation, and then excise parts of it as being 'not  really Australia' for the purposes of migration. We say human rights are indivisible, and then  suspend them for indigenous Australians. 

 Similarly, equality shouldn't stop at the office door, and democracy shouldn't disappear at the  factory gate. The name 'The Greens' has its origins in the activism of community members and  workers who in the 1970s joined together to prevent the destruction of important parts of our built  and natural environment. Petra Kelly, visiting Australia at the time, was so impressed by the 'green  bans' imposed by the unions and the community that she took it back with her to Germany where  they founded Die GrÃÂ¼nen, 'The Greens'. Anyone who took such a stand today for 'green bans' would  face the Australian Building and Construction Commission, denied the right to silence, interrogated  in secret and exposed to threats of imprisonment and fines. When members of one section of our  workforce have not just fewer rights than other workers but are indeed worse off than accused

 criminals, we can't say we are all truly equal before the law. 

 This is simply the briefest of sketches of where the debate might lead over the next few years. But  all the elements are there for a well-resourced, evidence driven debate about how to regulate work  in a time of increasing crises. 

 These are exciting times. In a Parliament where no single party has a majority, it provides a great  opportunity for new ideas to be debated and tested. 

 And with a growing sense that ideas like working fewer or more flexible hours are ripe with  potential, but that as a society we haven't got it right just yet, now is the time to discuss how  workers can have more control over their lives. I am optimistic that guided by these values of  sustainability, compassion and equality, we can meet the current crises in the field of work.
