 ROGER PRICE MP  Federal Member for Chifley   

 LABOR’S REFUGEE AND ASYLUM SEEKER  CAMPAIGN WILL CONTINUE   

 

 Labor’s legislative amendment to get children out from behind the razor  wire of immigration detention facilities, was defeated by the Howard  Government in parliament.    

 The House of Representatives debated the Migration Legislation  Amendment (No.1) Bill in its last session.    

 The amendment to the Bill by Labor sought to modify the legal power to  detain asylum seekers so that the Government would be compelled to:   

 â¢ Put unaccompanied children into foster or community care  arrangements  â¢ Allow families with children to live in accommodation like the  Woomera alternate detention trial.   

 Roger Price MP, Federal Member for Chifley, a member of the Human  Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs,  Defence and Trade, spoke in parliament on the merits of this amendment.   

 The members of the Human Rights Subcommittee are “really concerned  about the mental health impact on kids of being in detention centres” Mr  Price said in Parliament last week.    

 “The other issue that was of great concern to committee members was the  education of the kids in the detention centres. It is true that there are  teachers at these detention centres. But the notion that somehow the  children there are happily progressing along the curriculum is utterly  fictitious” Mr Price said.   

 Despite the fact that the amendment was defeated, Labor has pledged to  continue the campaign to get children out from behind the razor wire of  immigration facilities.    

 The amendment will come back before the House of Representatives again  and when it does, the following questions will be posed:   

 â¢ Do I believe that getting children out from behind the razor wire is so  important that it should be guaranteed by law? 

 â¢ Do I believe that families should be kept together and enormous damage is done  when families are forcibly split?   

 All members of the Government will be forced to answer these questions as Labor’s  campaign to free the children continues.    

 

 Ends          19  December  2002
